 what do you mean by sensible loss ? i think john gruden is a huge mistake for the team . 
 well i think his a good player , hard to replace , that s what i meant or at least in the raiders team his become an important piece for the coach 
 john gruden is an nfl head coach . he 's not a player . the 33 - 13 loss to the rams was just the beginning of a miserable season . are you familiar with the nfl ? 
 oh i see , i guess i m confusing him with a player of the team , what was his name i think it was khalil mack , and i do follow some games what about you ? 
 football is one of my favorite sports and i follow all 32 teams . khalil mack was traded to the bears by john gruden for some picks . they definitely felt his absence . i do n't know why they did n't just resign him . 
 maybe he demanded a high salary ? what is your favorite nfl team ? 

","the raiders sacked goff only once , on a play during which bruce irvin forced a fumble . other than that , the oakland defense could put almost no pressure on goff . the absence of mack , the former nfl defensive player of the year , was glaring . in the first half sunday night , mack had a sack , a forced fumble , a fumble recovery , an interception and a touchdown on defense . he and the bears could not sustain that , and they succumbed to the second - half exploits of packers quarterback aaron rodgers . but mack reinforced what a game - changing , difference - making player he is . he left little doubt that he is worth the six - year , $ 141 million contract given to him by the bears , making him the league 's highest - paid defensive player . [ the nfl teams that have serious reasons to worry , versus the ones that do n't ] mack , while still with the raiders , had been holding out , seeking such a deal . the raiders did n't want to give it to him . they have a $ 125 million quarterback in carr . they have a $ 100 million coach in gruden . they drew the line at handing out another mammoth deal , not wanting to further strain their budget or push the boundaries of the salary cap . they regarded the king 's ransom of draft picks put forth by the bears , including a pair of first - rounders , as an offer they could n't refuse . in truth , they could have refused it .
","i like the giants best , you ? . he did demand a high salary . he 's the highest paid defensive player in the nfl . i guess the raiders tied up too much money in carr and gruden . 
","i like the eagles . i think they are doing well this season .

 hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days . 
 that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet . 
 what about the problems with the ncaa though ? the nfl needs the players . 
 i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along . 
 what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down . 
 that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go . 
 i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans . 
 oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick . 
 i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true . 
 i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver . 
 women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ? 
 this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage . 
 belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products . 

","the cleveland browns ' last playoff win was in 1995 against the new england patriots and their head coach was bill belichick . this was bill 's first playoff win as head coach and the only playoff win as head coach outside the patriots .
","oh absolutely . belichek is looking at it from the right angle too . he wants to win , that 's what he is paid for . i think the guy would hire a green martian if he thought it would guarantee an extra td . 
","i think he is a great coach , he is the best coach in the history of the nfl , he is the head of the most important position in the history of the nfl

 it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ? 
 oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore . 
 baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact . 
 yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ? 
 i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games . 
 yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ? 
 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something . 
 yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ? 
 the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 . 
 yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics 
 i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball . 
 yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us "" run to fourth ! "" and we were like , "" you mean home ? run home ? "" 
 baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect "" rounders "" cards the way we collect baseball cards . 
 right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer . 
 some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .

 yes . he took so many ap classes in high school he entered college as a junior , he started working on a masters then . 
 now that is impressive , you have this impression of sports players as jocks , but he transcends that stereotype . 
 he really does , he was drafted as a number one pick in 2005 too . 
 do you go to football games ? i 've been to one once in my life at indiana university . 
 i ve been to quite a few at florida state , but no pro games . there is only 11 minutes of live action anyway 
 i think that is what puts me off , i really do n't have time to sit in front of the tv for three hours , and then for only 11 minutes of play . 
 it is hard to find time for that , i do nt know how some people do it all day , on a weekly basis . 
 i guess some people listen to games on the radio , difficult to see how that works . 
 i ve done it traveling , you ve got to really know the team and all of the players names . it was so much harder . 
 do you have a favorite nfl team . like i said , i lived in dc for a while so kind of follow them . now in northern ohio , the browns are a difficult team to support . 
 i feel you there , living in florida here . dolphins are hard to root for and feel proud . 
 it could be worse , i read about this team that lost 220 - 0 . it would be hard to watch to the end .

 no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines . 
 yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables . 
 even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ? 
 we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures . 
 less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ? 
 youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular . 
 true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ? 
 i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often . 
 i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like "" how to "" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following . 
 it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility . 
 agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success . 
 do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ? 
 i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street . 
 it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase . 
 it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .

 me neither but the gillette stadium in foxborough seems like a giant stadium . have you ever seen a live professional football game ? 
 yes , the falcons and the chiefs . i like college better , like georgia tech . they could use a brady qb however ... 
 haha , i agree , i really enjoy going to college football games . although i never knew that the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback so other teams could not read his hand signals . 
 did n't know that either ... i thought it was because they could n't hear . qb 's have to scream to be heard in most stadiums . some qbs are smart like alex smith who got a bachelors in 2 years . 
 that 's surprising , it seems like the focus on athletes is n't about school but rather heavy emphasis on sports so to see him go on to get his master 's degree , is very surprising to me . 
 i agree but some are both jocks and academics . i wonder if brady was ? i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles . 
 i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called "" patriot way "" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !

 no i have n't . i heard it was good . 
 i have not yet either but i am aware of it 's cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy . 
 my mother like it . i think it stars michelle yeoh , henry golding and constance wu , right ? 
 it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background . 
 if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director . 
 yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film . 
 the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 . 
 that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen . 
 well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life . 
 i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat . 
 this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us . 
 that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ? 
 it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth . 
 i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long . 
 i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada . 
 i wonder how much affect that has ? is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .

"" we strictly prohibit the use of twitter data and apis for surveillance purposes , including performing background checks,&rdquo ; pacilio said.the crackdown , which was first reported by bbc news , could restrict predictim&rsquo;s ability to analyze babysitters with what it called & ldquo;advanced artificial intelligence&rdquo ; and sell parents the results . the service was heavily criticized for offering unproven and potentially inaccurate results that could affect a babysitter&rsquo;s life.but predictim&rsquo;s executives said tuesday they were undeterred and intend to continue pulling publicly available data from facebook , twitter and instagram . predictim chief executive and co - founder sal parsa said he also believed the social media giants ' reaction was at least partially rooted in a competitive rivalry over personal data use.&ldquo;twitter and facebook are already mining our data .

 i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award 
 yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their "" home grown "" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out . 
 i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to 
 sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ? 
 i recently met a girl who lives in that area , and she said the nightlife is worth visiting for . it sounds like many of the events feature jazz music . do you listen to jazz very often ? 
 a little bit , i 'm not too familiar with it . i know is originated in new orleans and a little bit about the history , but that 's about it . heard clint eastwood is a big jazz fan , thought that was pretty interesting .. 
 there 's many different styles , probably derived from the various regions in the us where it has taken root . kansas city is another place where it has prominence 
 you know there 's a programming language in which programs are written in musical composition , and so the programs have jazz - like harmonies . as a computer guy , i find that pretty fascinating . so , you ever been to a live concert ? ( jazz or otherwise ? ) 
 that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though . 
 it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music ! 
 i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii 
 wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those "" eccentric rock and roll musician "" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ... 
 it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters 
 well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ? 
 now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit 

","in 2002 a creed concert was so bad that four concert goers filed a lawsuit against the band
","oh , man , ca n't imagine a concert being so bad you get sued by the audience members ... guessing maybe they had mechanical problems , or one of the band members was n't performing very well . i recall news of a concert ( not creed , ca n't recall who it was ) where the guy was drunk on stage , and slurred through his songs . they ended up refunding the audience 's money .. 
","i think that the band was a great band , i think it was a great show , i liked creed , i think its a great band , i like the band creed , they had a great concert back in 2002

 i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ? 
 i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood 
 are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status 
 yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ? 
 not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books 
 well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing machines from there which seems very useful to me 
 true ! it would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years 
 i hope so . what do you think about william gladstone ? he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol 
 considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips 
 i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country 
 i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book 
 well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol 
 children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though

 what do you mean by sensible loss ? i think john gruden is a huge mistake for the team . 
 well i think his a good player , hard to replace , that s what i meant or at least in the raiders team his become an important piece for the coach 
 john gruden is an nfl head coach . he 's not a player . the 33 - 13 loss to the rams was just the beginning of a miserable season . are you familiar with the nfl ? 
 oh i see , i guess i m confusing him with a player of the team , what was his name i think it was khalil mack , and i do follow some games what about you ? 
 football is one of my favorite sports and i follow all 32 teams . khalil mack was traded to the bears by john gruden for some picks . they definitely felt his absence . i do n't know why they did n't just resign him . 
 maybe he demanded a high salary ? what is your favorite nfl team ? 

","the raiders sacked goff only once , on a play during which bruce irvin forced a fumble . other than that , the oakland defense could put almost no pressure on goff . the absence of mack , the former nfl defensive player of the year , was glaring . in the first half sunday night , mack had a sack , a forced fumble , a fumble recovery , an interception and a touchdown on defense . he and the bears could not sustain that , and they succumbed to the second - half exploits of packers quarterback aaron rodgers . but mack reinforced what a game - changing , difference - making player he is . he left little doubt that he is worth the six - year , $ 141 million contract given to him by the bears , making him the league 's highest - paid defensive player . [ the nfl teams that have serious reasons to worry , versus the ones that do n't ] mack , while still with the raiders , had been holding out , seeking such a deal . the raiders did n't want to give it to him . they have a $ 125 million quarterback in carr . they have a $ 100 million coach in gruden . they drew the line at handing out another mammoth deal , not wanting to further strain their budget or push the boundaries of the salary cap . they regarded the king 's ransom of draft picks put forth by the bears , including a pair of first - rounders , as an offer they could n't refuse . in truth , they could have refused it .
","i like the giants best , you ? . he did demand a high salary . he 's the highest paid defensive player in the nfl . i guess the raiders tied up too much money in carr and gruden .

 hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days . 
 that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet . 
 what about the problems with the ncaa though ? the nfl needs the players . 
 i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along . 
 what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down . 
 that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go . 
 i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans . 
 oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick . 
 i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true . 
 i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver . 
 women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ? 
 this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage . 
 belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products . 

","the cleveland browns ' last playoff win was in 1995 against the new england patriots and their head coach was bill belichick . this was bill 's first playoff win as head coach and the only playoff win as head coach outside the patriots .
","oh absolutely . belichek is looking at it from the right angle too . he wants to win , that 's what he is paid for . i think the guy would hire a green martian if he thought it would guarantee an extra td . 
",i think belichick is very strategic and he would n't do something if it would n't help his team win . the last time cleveland won a game in the playoffs was when belichick was their coach . shows how lucky teams are to have him .,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,5.0

 no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines . 
 yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables . 
 even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ? 
 we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures . 
 less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ? 
 youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular . 
 true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ? 
 i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often . 
 i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like "" how to "" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following . 
 it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility . 
 agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success . 
 do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ? 
 i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street . 
 it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase . 
 it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .

 did n't know that either ... i thought it was because they could n't hear . qb 's have to scream to be heard in most stadiums . some qbs are smart like alex smith who got a bachelors in 2 years . 
 that 's surprising , it seems like the focus on athletes is n't about school but rather heavy emphasis on sports so to see him go on to get his master 's degree , is very surprising to me . 
 i agree but some are both jocks and academics . i wonder if brady was ? i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .

 yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film .

 this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us . 
 that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ? 
 it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth . 
 i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long .

"" we strictly prohibit the use of twitter data and apis for surveillance purposes , including performing background checks,&rdquo ; pacilio said.the crackdown , which was first reported by bbc news , could restrict predictim&rsquo;s ability to analyze babysitters with what it called & ldquo;advanced artificial intelligence&rdquo ; and sell parents the results . the service was heavily criticized for offering unproven and potentially inaccurate results that could affect a babysitter&rsquo;s life.but predictim&rsquo;s executives said tuesday they were undeterred and intend to continue pulling publicly available data from facebook , twitter and instagram . predictim chief executive and co - founder sal parsa said he also believed the social media giants ' reaction was at least partially rooted in a competitive rivalry over personal data use.&ldquo;twitter and facebook are already mining our data .

 yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their "" home grown "" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out . 
 i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to

 a little bit , i 'm not too familiar with it . i know is originated in new orleans and a little bit about the history , but that 's about it . heard clint eastwood is a big jazz fan , thought that was pretty interesting .. 
 there 's many different styles , probably derived from the various regions in the us where it has taken root . kansas city is another place where it has prominence 
 you know there 's a programming language in which programs are written in musical composition , and so the programs have jazz - like harmonies . as a computer guy , i find that pretty fascinating . so , you ever been to a live concert ? ( jazz or otherwise ? ) 
 that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though . 
 it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music ! 
 i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii 
 wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those "" eccentric rock and roll musician "" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ... 
 it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters 
 well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ? 
 now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit 

","in 2002 a creed concert was so bad that four concert goers filed a lawsuit against the band

 i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ? 
 i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood 
 are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status 
 yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ? 
 not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books 
 well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing machines from there which seems very useful to me 
 true ! it would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years 
 i hope so . what do you think about william gladstone ? he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol 
 considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips 
 i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country 
 i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book 
 well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol 
 children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though

 football is one of my favorite sports and i follow all 32 teams . khalil mack was traded to the bears by john gruden for some picks . they definitely felt his absence . i do n't know why they did n't just resign him . 
 maybe he demanded a high salary ? what is your favorite nfl team ? 

","the raiders sacked goff only once , on a play during which bruce irvin forced a fumble . other than that , the oakland defense could put almost no pressure on goff . the absence of mack , the former nfl defensive player of the year , was glaring . in the first half sunday night , mack had a sack , a forced fumble , a fumble recovery , an interception and a touchdown on defense . he and the bears could not sustain that , and they succumbed to the second - half exploits of packers quarterback aaron rodgers . but mack reinforced what a game - changing , difference - making player he is . he left little doubt that he is worth the six - year , $ 141 million contract given to him by the bears , making him the league 's highest - paid defensive player . [ the nfl teams that have serious reasons to worry , versus the ones that do n't ] mack , while still with the raiders , had been holding out , seeking such a deal . the raiders did n't want to give it to him . they have a $ 125 million quarterback in carr . they have a $ 100 million coach in gruden . they drew the line at handing out another mammoth deal , not wanting to further strain their budget or push the boundaries of the salary cap . they regarded the king 's ransom of draft picks put forth by the bears , including a pair of first - rounders , as an offer they could n't refuse . in truth , they could have refused it .
","i like the giants best , you ? . he did demand a high salary . he 's the highest paid defensive player in the nfl . i guess the raiders tied up too much money in carr and gruden . 
","i think he 's a great player . i think he 's a great player .

 hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days . 
 that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet . 
 what about the problems with the ncaa though ? the nfl needs the players . 
 i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along . 
 what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down . 
 that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go . 
 i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans . 
 oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick . 
 i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true . 
 i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver . 
 women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ? 
 this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage . 
 belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products . 

","the cleveland browns ' last playoff win was in 1995 against the new england patriots and their head coach was bill belichick . this was bill 's first playoff win as head coach and the only playoff win as head coach outside the patriots .
","oh absolutely . belichek is looking at it from the right angle too . he wants to win , that 's what he is paid for . i think the guy would hire a green martian if he thought it would guarantee an extra td . 
","yes , i agree . the last playoff win was in 1995 against the patriots .

 it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ? 
 oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore . 
 baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact . 
 yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ? 
 i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games . 
 yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ? 
 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something . 
 yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ? 
 the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 . 
 yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics 
 i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball . 
 yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us "" run to fourth ! "" and we were like , "" you mean home ? run home ? "" 
 baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect "" rounders "" cards the way we collect baseball cards . 
 right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer . 
 some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money . 
 yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s . 
 thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .

","well , but time probably added to the value , no ? i wonder if the grandson found a honus wagner . is n't that the super valuable one ? in the 90s i think wayne gretzky bought one as an investment .

 sorry , i ca n't say that i do , i'm familiar with the big stories , but that is it . 
 that is about how much i know , just the basics , and some fun trivia . 
 i used to live in dc son kind of know the redskins , but alex smith is new to me , is he the quarterback ? 
 yes . he took so many ap classes in high school he entered college as a junior , he started working on a masters then . 
 now that is impressive , you have this impression of sports players as jocks , but he transcends that stereotype . 
 he really does , he was drafted as a number one pick in 2005 too . 
 do you go to football games ? i 've been to one once in my life at indiana university . 
 i ve been to quite a few at florida state , but no pro games . there is only 11 minutes of live action anyway 
 i think that is what puts me off , i really do n't have time to sit in front of the tv for three hours , and then for only 11 minutes of play . 
 it is hard to find time for that , i do nt know how some people do it all day , on a weekly basis . 
 i guess some people listen to games on the radio , difficult to see how that works . 
 i ve done it traveling , you ve got to really know the team and all of the players names . it was so much harder . 
 do you have a favorite nfl team . like i said , i lived in dc for a while so kind of follow them . now in northern ohio , the browns are a difficult team to support . 
 i feel you there , living in florida here . dolphins are hard to root for and feel proud . 
 it could be worse , i read about this team that lost 220 - 0 . it would be hard to watch to the end . 

","- that the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 222 - 0
","that would be really hard . ga tech sure did dominate that game . 
","i 'm not sure . i think it 's crazy that the highest scoring football game ever was 222 - 0 .

 i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using . 
 haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha 
 yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten . 
 right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious 
 that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ? 
 i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute 
 i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way 
 ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military 
 i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe 
 ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion 
 i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 . 
 ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! ! 
 it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them . 
 ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc

 no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines . 
 yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables . 
 even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ? 
 we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures . 
 less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ? 
 youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular . 
 true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ? 
 i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often . 
 i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like "" how to "" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following . 
 it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility . 
 agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success . 
 do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ? 
 i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street . 
 it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase . 
 it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras . 

","pixar studio has a secret room that is visited often by celebrities
","so in your opinion there will be more "" homegrown "" celebrities and less hollywood stars ? you could be right , hollywood seems less and less connected to its public . 
","i do n't think i 've seen that . i do n't think it 's funny that pixar has a secret room that is visited only celebrities can visit .

 yeah the diamondbacks had a chance and then they did have a bad 2nd half of the season . i am a brewers fan and our gm made some amazing moves in the offseason and it paid off big . 
 nice ! ( except for ryan braun ) i like the brewers and was pulling for them against the dodgers ( who i hate more than braun ) ! 
 yeah i was so disappointed with the whole braun thing , i was like just admit you messed up , and get on with it . the lying and blaming others is just the worst ! thanks though , game 7 just sucked ! i do like the dbacks though , craig counsel your old hero ! ! 
 yep - craig is the man , glad he 's having success with the brewers . even your bench coach ( murphy ) has arizona ties ( asu ) . i really like your corner infielders shaw / aguilar 

","baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if the need arises
","nice ! i did n't know that about murphy , arizona is such an awesome place i want to go back soon ! and yeah aguilar is such a good guy too , i love sports pros who you know are decent people in real life . did you know managers can technically play if needed ? ! 
","haha i like the nationals too , they are my favorite team , i like the costumes , i think the team is really good though , i like the idea of managers and uniforms

 even as a chiefs fan , do you think that tom brady is the greatest quarterback of all time , has he is commonly referred to . 
 he 's one of the best for sure . i go back to johnny unitas as a kid so that 's a tough call . all kinds of variables like kellan moore being left - handed . 
 apparently , kellan moore is the only left - handed quarterback in the nfl , i wonder if the defensive plays factor in that fact and are adjusted . 
 probably , maybe its like baseball and pitchers and batters play r / l - handedness . speaking of brady , i did n't know he played at u of michigan . 
 yeah , could be to the team 's advantage . yeah , i did n't know that , did brady play at umich on a scholarship ? 
 probably ... he was a 6th round draft pick in 2000 . i do like boston but i 'm not sure i 've ever been to foxborough where the pat 's play . 
 me neither but the gillette stadium in foxborough seems like a giant stadium . have you ever seen a live professional football game ? 
 yes , the falcons and the chiefs . i like college better , like georgia tech . they could use a brady qb however ... 
 haha , i agree , i really enjoy going to college football games . although i never knew that the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback so other teams could not read his hand signals . 
 did n't know that either ... i thought it was because they could n't hear . qb 's have to scream to be heard in most stadiums . some qbs are smart like alex smith who got a bachelors in 2 years . 
 that 's surprising , it seems like the focus on athletes is n't about school but rather heavy emphasis on sports so to see him go on to get his master 's degree , is very surprising to me . 
 i agree but some are both jocks and academics . i wonder if brady was ? i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles . 
 i definitely think that his leadership and tenacity and the so called "" patriot way "" can really shape people and lead them to their championships but his wife makes more than double brady 's salary ! i thought she was retired !

 this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us . 
 that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ? 
 it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth . 
 i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long . 
 i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada .

"" we strictly prohibit the use of twitter data and apis for surveillance purposes , including performing background checks,&rdquo ; pacilio said.the crackdown , which was first reported by bbc news , could restrict predictim&rsquo;s ability to analyze babysitters with what it called & ldquo;advanced artificial intelligence&rdquo ; and sell parents the results . the service was heavily criticized for offering unproven and potentially inaccurate results that could affect a babysitter&rsquo;s life.but predictim&rsquo;s executives said tuesday they were undeterred and intend to continue pulling publicly available data from facebook , twitter and instagram . predictim chief executive and co - founder sal parsa said he also believed the social media giants ' reaction was at least partially rooted in a competitive rivalry over personal data use.&ldquo;twitter and facebook are already mining our data .

 i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award 
 yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their "" home grown "" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out . 
 i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to 
 sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ? 
 i recently met a girl who lives in that area , and she said the nightlife is worth visiting for . it sounds like many of the events feature jazz music . do you listen to jazz very often ? 
 a little bit , i 'm not too familiar with it . i know is originated in new orleans and a little bit about the history , but that 's about it . heard clint eastwood is a big jazz fan , thought that was pretty interesting .. 
 there 's many different styles , probably derived from the various regions in the us where it has taken root . kansas city is another place where it has prominence 
 you know there 's a programming language in which programs are written in musical composition , and so the programs have jazz - like harmonies . as a computer guy , i find that pretty fascinating . so , you ever been to a live concert ? ( jazz or otherwise ? ) 
 that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though . 
 it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music ! 
 i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii 
 wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those "" eccentric rock and roll musician "" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ... 
 it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters 
 well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ? 
 now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit 

","in 2002 a creed concert was so bad that four concert goers filed a lawsuit against the band
","oh , man , ca n't imagine a concert being so bad you get sued by the audience members ... guessing maybe they had mechanical problems , or one of the band members was n't performing very well . i recall news of a concert ( not creed , ca n't recall who it was ) where the guy was drunk on stage , and slurred through his songs . they ended up refunding the audience 's money .. 
","i agree . i wonder if they were still around when they were playing ?

 i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ? 
 i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood 
 are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status 
 yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ? 
 not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books 
 well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing machines from there which seems very useful to me 
 true ! it would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years 
 i hope so . what do you think about william gladstone ? he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol 
 considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips 
 i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country 
 i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book 
 well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol 
 children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though

 hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days . 
 that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet . 
 what about the problems with the ncaa though ? the nfl needs the players . 
 i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along . 
 what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down . 
 that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go . 
 i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans . 
 oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick . 
 i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true . 
 i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver . 
 women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ? 
 this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage . 
 belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products . 

","the cleveland browns ' last playoff win was in 1995 against the new england patriots and their head coach was bill belichick . this was bill 's first playoff win as head coach and the only playoff win as head coach outside the patriots .

 it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ? 
 oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore . 
 baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact . 
 yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ? 
 i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games . 
 yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ? 
 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something . 
 yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ? 
 the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 . 
 yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics 
 i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball . 
 yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us "" run to fourth ! "" and we were like , "" you mean home ? run home ? "" 
 baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect "" rounders "" cards the way we collect baseball cards . 
 right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer . 
 some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money . 
 yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s . 
 thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .

","well , but time probably added to the value , no ? i wonder if the grandson found a honus wagner . is n't that the super valuable one ? in the 90s i think wayne gretzky bought one as an investment .

 sorry , i ca n't say that i do , i'm familiar with the big stories , but that is it . 
 that is about how much i know , just the basics , and some fun trivia . 
 i used to live in dc son kind of know the redskins , but alex smith is new to me , is he the quarterback ? 
 yes . he took so many ap classes in high school he entered college as a junior , he started working on a masters then . 
 now that is impressive , you have this impression of sports players as jocks , but he transcends that stereotype . 
 he really does , he was drafted as a number one pick in 2005 too . 
 do you go to football games ? i 've been to one once in my life at indiana university . 
 i ve been to quite a few at florida state , but no pro games . there is only 11 minutes of live action anyway 
 i think that is what puts me off , i really do n't have time to sit in front of the tv for three hours , and then for only 11 minutes of play . 
 it is hard to find time for that , i do nt know how some people do it all day , on a weekly basis . 
 i guess some people listen to games on the radio , difficult to see how that works . 
 i ve done it traveling , you ve got to really know the team and all of the players names . it was so much harder . 
 do you have a favorite nfl team . like i said , i lived in dc for a while so kind of follow them . now in northern ohio , the browns are a difficult team to support . 
 i feel you there , living in florida here . dolphins are hard to root for and feel proud . 
 it could be worse , i read about this team that lost 220 - 0 . it would be hard to watch to the end . 

","- that the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 222 - 0

 i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using . 
 haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha 
 yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten . 
 right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious 
 that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ? 
 i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute 
 i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way 
 ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military 
 i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe 
 ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion 
 i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 . 
 ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! ! 
 it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .

 no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines . 
 yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables . 
 even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ? 
 we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures . 
 less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ? 
 youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular . 
 true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ? 
 i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often . 
 i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like "" how to "" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following . 
 it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility . 
 agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success . 
 do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ? 
 i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street . 
 it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase . 
 it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras . 

","pixar studio has a secret room that is visited often by celebrities
","so in your opinion there will be more "" homegrown "" celebrities and less hollywood stars ? you could be right , hollywood seems less and less connected to its public .

 the third movie was the only fantasy film to win an academy award for "" best picture ""

 yes . but one would really have to dig deeply to keep score . most news is about when congress can not agree . there is a fold in the brain that is the only thing that allows us to tell the difference between fantasy and reality . 
 that 's an important fold ! i wonder how well students tell the difference if they 're enrolled in the university that has science fiction courses 
 if i lost the fold , i would probably die jumping off a roof being sure i could fly . otherwise , my "" reality "" would be pretty good since i do n't dream or day dream bad things . those students would probably encounter some monsters .

 it sure would . in fantasy football one of the most important selections is qb since the qb touches the ball on most every play .

 i 've never been , though i want to go.the white house seems behind the curve technologically . w. had solar panels put back on the white house . reagan had them taken off . i wonder why clinton did n’t put them back on . floppy disks ? i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice . 
 well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently . 
 i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i ’m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house . 
 like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson . 
 though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though . 
 i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead . 
 what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's

 the amount of living animals on the planet currently is 20 quintillion ! how fascinating ! 
 you 're right , that is fascinating . i just found out that jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an am radio . 
 wow ! i am curious to try that and to see if it works . do you know of any other fun facts about jupiter ? 
 yes , according to canadian law , all radios are required to have at least 40 % of the music played be canadian . 
 interesting . i would not think that there was even that much music to play . do you know of any canadian musicians ? 
 yes , nickleback and avril lavigne ... and sorry , that was not about jupiter ... 
 it was about radios though which is very interesting . did you know that soldiers in world war ii made radios from razorblades and pencils ? 
 i did not . i thought it would have been more sophisticated than that . there is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free

 my mother like it . i think it stars michelle yeoh , henry golding and constance wu , right ? 
 it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background .

 yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film . 
 the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 .

 this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us . 
 that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ? 
 it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth . 
 i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long . 
 i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada .

 the baby sitter - rating system broke the social networks ' rules . 

","facebook and twitter are taking action against an automated babysitter - rating system reported on last week by the washington post , saying the service broke the social networks ' rules on user surveillance and data privacy.predictim , a california - based start - up , analyzes babysitters ' online histories , including on facebook and twitter , and offers ratings of whether they are at risk of drug abuse , bullying or having a & ldquo;bad attitude.&rdquo ; facebook said it dramatically limited predictim&rsquo;s access to users ' information on instagram and facebook a few weeks ago for violating a ban on developers ' use of personal data to evaluate a person for decisions on hiring or eligibility.facebook spokeswoman katy dormer said the company also launched an investigation earlier this week into predictim&rsquo;s extraction , or & ldquo;scraping,&rdquo ; of personal data . that investigation is ongoing and could include further penalties.twitter spokesman nick pacilio said the site conducted its own investigation earlier this week and revoked predictim&rsquo;s access to important site tools & mdash ; known as application programming interfaces , or apis & mdash ; that would allow the start - up to review and analyze babysitters ' tweets on a massive scale . "" we strictly prohibit the use of twitter data and apis for surveillance purposes , including performing background checks,&rdquo ; pacilio said.the crackdown , which was first reported by bbc news , could restrict predictim&rsquo;s ability to analyze babysitters with what it called & ldquo;advanced artificial intelligence&rdquo ; and sell parents the results . the service was heavily criticized for offering unproven and potentially inaccurate results that could affect a babysitter&rsquo;s life.but predictim&rsquo;s executives said tuesday they were undeterred and intend to continue pulling publicly available data from facebook , twitter and instagram . predictim chief executive and co - founder sal parsa said he also believed the social media giants ' reaction was at least partially rooted in a competitive rivalry over personal data use.&ldquo;twitter and facebook are already mining our data .
","i think i heard about that now that you mention it . was the about predictim ? 
","yeah , i guess it 's not that easy to do . i think they have a great time with the consumer ratings though .

 i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award 
 yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their "" home grown "" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out . 
 i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to 
 sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ? 
 i recently met a girl who lives in that area , and she said the nightlife is worth visiting for . it sounds like many of the events feature jazz music . do you listen to jazz very often ? 
 a little bit , i 'm not too familiar with it . i know is originated in new orleans and a little bit about the history , but that 's about it . heard clint eastwood is a big jazz fan , thought that was pretty interesting .. 
 there 's many different styles , probably derived from the various regions in the us where it has taken root . kansas city is another place where it has prominence 
 you know there 's a programming language in which programs are written in musical composition , and so the programs have jazz - like harmonies . as a computer guy , i find that pretty fascinating . so , you ever been to a live concert ? ( jazz or otherwise ? ) 
 that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though . 
 it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music ! 
 i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii 
 wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those "" eccentric rock and roll musician "" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ... 
 it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters 
 well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ? 
 now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit 

","in 2002 a creed concert was so bad that four concert goers filed a lawsuit against the band
","oh , man , ca n't imagine a concert being so bad you get sued by the audience members ... guessing maybe they had mechanical problems , or one of the band members was n't performing very well . i recall news of a concert ( not creed , ca n't recall who it was ) where the guy was drunk on stage , and slurred through his songs . they ended up refunding the audience 's money .. 
","yes , i 've been to a concert in a while , i 'm not too big of a fan , but i do n't think i 've seen it .

 i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ? 
 i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood 
 are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status 
 yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ? 
 not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books 
 well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing machines from there which seems very useful to me 
 true ! it would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years 
 i hope so . what do you think about william gladstone ? he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol 
 considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips 
 i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country 
 i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book 
 well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol 
 children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though 
 haha i agree with you . do you ever buy stuff from amazon ? do you know why jeff bezos put a clock into a mountain lol 

","amazon ceo jeff bezos built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years .
","i buy things from amazon all the time . is n't that the clock that 's supposed to run for 10,000 years

 what do you mean by sensible loss ? i think john gruden is a huge mistake for the team . 
 well i think his a good player , hard to replace , that s what i meant or at least in the raiders team his become an important piece for the coach 
 john gruden is an nfl head coach . he 's not a player . the 33 - 13 loss to the rams was just the beginning of a miserable season . are you familiar with the nfl ? 
 oh i see , i guess i m confusing him with a player of the team , what was his name i think it was khalil mack , and i do follow some games what about you ? 
 football is one of my favorite sports and i follow all 32 teams . khalil mack was traded to the bears by john gruden for some picks . they definitely felt his absence . i do n't know why they did n't just resign him . 
 maybe he demanded a high salary ? what is your favorite nfl team ? 

","the raiders sacked goff only once , on a play during which bruce irvin forced a fumble . other than that , the oakland defense could put almost no pressure on goff . the absence of mack , the former nfl defensive player of the year , was glaring . in the first half sunday night , mack had a sack , a forced fumble , a fumble recovery , an interception and a touchdown on defense . he and the bears could not sustain that , and they succumbed to the second - half exploits of packers quarterback aaron rodgers . but mack reinforced what a game - changing , difference - making player he is . he left little doubt that he is worth the six - year , $ 141 million contract given to him by the bears , making him the league 's highest - paid defensive player . [ the nfl teams that have serious reasons to worry , versus the ones that do n't ] mack , while still with the raiders , had been holding out , seeking such a deal . the raiders did n't want to give it to him . they have a $ 125 million quarterback in carr . they have a $ 100 million coach in gruden . they drew the line at handing out another mammoth deal , not wanting to further strain their budget or push the boundaries of the salary cap . they regarded the king 's ransom of draft picks put forth by the bears , including a pair of first - rounders , as an offer they could n't refuse . in truth , they could have refused it .
","i like the giants best , you ? . he did demand a high salary . he 's the highest paid defensive player in the nfl . i guess the raiders tied up too much money in carr and gruden .

 hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days . 
 that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet . 
 what about the problems with the ncaa though ? the nfl needs the players . 
 i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along . 
 what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down . 
 that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go . 
 i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans . 
 oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick . 
 i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true . 
 i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver . 
 women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ? 
 this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage . 
 belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products . 

","the cleveland browns ' last playoff win was in 1995 against the new england patriots and their head coach was bill belichick . this was bill 's first playoff win as head coach and the only playoff win as head coach outside the patriots .
","oh absolutely . belichek is looking at it from the right angle too . he wants to win , that 's what he is paid for . i think the guy would hire a green martian if he thought it would guarantee an extra td .

 sorry , i ca n't say that i do , i'm familiar with the big stories , but that is it . 
 that is about how much i know , just the basics , and some fun trivia . 
 i used to live in dc son kind of know the redskins , but alex smith is new to me , is he the quarterback ? 
 yes . he took so many ap classes in high school he entered college as a junior , he started working on a masters then . 
 now that is impressive , you have this impression of sports players as jocks , but he transcends that stereotype . 
 he really does , he was drafted as a number one pick in 2005 too . 
 do you go to football games ? i 've been to one once in my life at indiana university . 
 i ve been to quite a few at florida state , but no pro games . there is only 11 minutes of live action anyway 
 i think that is what puts me off , i really do n't have time to sit in front of the tv for three hours , and then for only 11 minutes of play . 
 it is hard to find time for that , i do nt know how some people do it all day , on a weekly basis . 
 i guess some people listen to games on the radio , difficult to see how that works . 
 i ve done it traveling , you ve got to really know the team and all of the players names . it was so much harder . 
 do you have a favorite nfl team . like i said , i lived in dc for a while so kind of follow them . now in northern ohio , the browns are a difficult team to support . 
 i feel you there , living in florida here . dolphins are hard to root for and feel proud . 
 it could be worse , i read about this team that lost 220 - 0 . it would be hard to watch to the end . 

","- that the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 222 - 0
","that would be really hard . ga tech sure did dominate that game . 
","i 'm surprised georgia tech cumberland was still on that day . i do n't think i 'd ever doubt it .

 i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using . 
 haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha 
 yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten . 
 right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious 
 that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ? 
 i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute 
 i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way 
 ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military 
 i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe 
 ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion 
 i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 . 
 ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! ! 
 it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them . 
 ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc 

","[ # 26 score:167 comments:24 ] - til - the trunk of your car is called that because old cars used to have wooden trunks on the back .
","it must be a really strong cable for sure , so do you like cars ? you know the first car to be mass produced was a ford .

 yes i admire him a lot , and it is so cool that he recorded in 5 languages !

 yeah , and since the white house still uses floppy disks , is this also true at the twin white houses ? 
 good point . i wonder if they use the floppy discs because they might still be safer 
 good question . perhaps , since teddy roosevelt banned christmas trees from the white house , perhaps bush issued an executive order against cds ? 
 well , it could be . good thing he brought back the solar panels though 
 true . although in 2011 , bullets struck the white house . it took the secret service 4 days to realize it . i wonder if the solar panels were damaged ?

 well , maybe they did n't notice because they were all inside listening to the latest pop music release from the president of indonesia ?

 the guy is a machine ! but he needs a better stage name . maybe president banana ?

 no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines . 
 yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables . 
 even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ? 
 we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures . 
 less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ? 
 youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular . 
 true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ? 
 i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often . 
 i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like "" how to "" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following . 
 it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility . 
 agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success . 
 do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ? 
 i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street . 
 it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase . 
 it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras . 

","pixar studio has a secret room that is visited often by celebrities
","so in your opinion there will be more "" homegrown "" celebrities and less hollywood stars ? you could be right , hollywood seems less and less connected to its public .

 me neither but the gillette stadium in foxborough seems like a giant stadium . have you ever seen a live professional football game ? 
 yes , the falcons and the chiefs . i like college better , like georgia tech . they could use a brady qb however ... 
 haha , i agree , i really enjoy going to college football games . although i never knew that the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback so other teams could not read his hand signals . 
 did n't know that either ... i thought it was because they could n't hear . qb 's have to scream to be heard in most stadiums . some qbs are smart like alex smith who got a bachelors in 2 years . 
 that 's surprising , it seems like the focus on athletes is n't about school but rather heavy emphasis on sports so to see him go on to get his master 's degree , is very surprising to me . 
 i agree but some are both jocks and academics . i wonder if brady was ? i do admire him he 's seen hard times like to 41 - 33 loss to the eagles .

 no i have n't . i heard it was good . 
 i have not yet either but i am aware of it 's cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy . 
 my mother like it . i think it stars michelle yeoh , henry golding and constance wu , right ? 
 it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background . 
 if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director . 
 yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film . 
 the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 . 
 that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen . 
 well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life . 
 i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat . 
 this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us . 
 that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ? 
 it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth . 
 i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long . 
 i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada . 
 i wonder how much affect that has ? is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .

 i concur . these are not the best people . 
 i love that the judge told him that bipolar does not excuse his behavior . 
 his excuse was such a joke . no one will believe that for sure 
 even his prepared statements sound so hollow . it is like a regurgitation of ever statement where people have got caught doing something wrong and want to manipulate their way out of punishment . 
 even with the best lawyer , he will never and ever get away such hideous crime 
 i wonder why as a co founder ja rule was not charged . 
 i have no idea , i think ja rule probably did not know the information beforehand . 
 it would have been nice if they had named the people who were scammed out of 1.2 million to give us an insight to how deep this attempt to defraud went . 
 i think because of privacy or personal issues that they do not want to release such information . do you keep track of celebrity news by any chance 
 no i do n't tend to read much about it unless it is front of me like this article . 
 okay . do you believe what is the max sentence and fine should this guy get ? 
 i think he should have gotten 20 years and be forced to return every cent he collected . what do you think ? 
 completely with you on this . to warn others from carrying out such act . 
 yes that would be a deterrent . punishments should be harsher to show the judicial system is serious .

"" we strictly prohibit the use of twitter data and apis for surveillance purposes , including performing background checks,&rdquo ; pacilio said.the crackdown , which was first reported by bbc news , could restrict predictim&rsquo;s ability to analyze babysitters with what it called & ldquo;advanced artificial intelligence&rdquo ; and sell parents the results . the service was heavily criticized for offering unproven and potentially inaccurate results that could affect a babysitter&rsquo;s life.but predictim&rsquo;s executives said tuesday they were undeterred and intend to continue pulling publicly available data from facebook , twitter and instagram . predictim chief executive and co - founder sal parsa said he also believed the social media giants ' reaction was at least partially rooted in a competitive rivalry over personal data use.&ldquo;twitter and facebook are already mining our data .

 i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award 
 yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their "" home grown "" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out . 
 i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to 
 sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ? 
 i recently met a girl who lives in that area , and she said the nightlife is worth visiting for . it sounds like many of the events feature jazz music . do you listen to jazz very often ? 
 a little bit , i 'm not too familiar with it . i know is originated in new orleans and a little bit about the history , but that 's about it . heard clint eastwood is a big jazz fan , thought that was pretty interesting .. 
 there 's many different styles , probably derived from the various regions in the us where it has taken root . kansas city is another place where it has prominence 
 you know there 's a programming language in which programs are written in musical composition , and so the programs have jazz - like harmonies . as a computer guy , i find that pretty fascinating . so , you ever been to a live concert ? ( jazz or otherwise ? ) 
 that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though . 
 it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music ! 
 i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii 
 wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those "" eccentric rock and roll musician "" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ... 
 it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters 
 well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ? 
 now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit 

","in 2002 a creed concert was so bad that four concert goers filed a lawsuit against the band
","oh , man , ca n't imagine a concert being so bad you get sued by the audience members ... guessing maybe they had mechanical problems , or one of the band members was n't performing very well . i recall news of a concert ( not creed , ca n't recall who it was ) where the guy was drunk on stage , and slurred through his songs . they ended up refunding the audience 's money .. 
","i wonder how the concert became so bad , and how the audience did that ? it 's been great chatting with you . have a good day !

 i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ? 
 i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood 
 are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status 
 yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ? 
 not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books 
 well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing machines from there which seems very useful to me 
 true ! it would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years 
 i hope so . what do you think about william gladstone ? he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol 
 considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips 
 i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country 
 i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book 
 well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol 
 children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though
