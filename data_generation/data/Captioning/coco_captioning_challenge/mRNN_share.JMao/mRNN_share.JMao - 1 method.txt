method_name: mRNN_share_CR
method_description: This is an updated version of the m-RNN model. 
We adopt the transposed weight sharing strategy introduced in the paper of Learning like a Child (arXiv 1412.6632 and 1504.06692). 
The model consists of two sub-networks: a RNN for sentences and a CNN for images. 
These two sub-networks interact with each other in a multimodal layer to form the whole m-RNN model. 
We only use MS COCO 2014 data. 
More details will be described in a followed up paper.
