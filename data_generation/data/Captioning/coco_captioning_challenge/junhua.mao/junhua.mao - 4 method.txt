method_name: m-RNN-shared
method_description: This is an updated version of the m-RNN model. We adopt the weight sharing strategy introced in the paper of Learning like a Child. The model consists of two sub-networks: a deep recurrent neural network for sentences and a deep convolutional network for images. These two sub-networks interact with each other in a multimodal layer to form the whole m-RNN model. We only use MS COCO 2014 data.
