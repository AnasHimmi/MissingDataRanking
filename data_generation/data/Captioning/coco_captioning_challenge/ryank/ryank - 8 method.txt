method_description: Our submission is an ensemble of 4 multimodal log-bilinear models [1,2] whose hyperparameters are tuned using Bayesian optimization with DNGO (Deep networks for global optimization) [3]. A beam search is used for generation.

NOTE: No training was done on the development set. Both development and test results use models trained on the official training set only.
