Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A lunatic institution, where young people are to meet today.
A pit chapel, where will now be dug for the suburban tunnel.
Small gardeners manage the former grounds of farmers.
Munich's oldest official map reveals exciting stories.
It's annoying when maps aren't up to date.
That's what anyone who has had to get upset about, because the Auto-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass.
The historical maps of the digital Baylor Atlas, an offer by the state government's Geoportal Bavaria, are far from up-to-date - but that is precisely why they are very revealing.
Especially if you compare them to current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and towns in the spread area of Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Baylor Atlas is a patchwork that is not equally recognized as such.
The large overview map included more detailed maps for cities and municipalities, so-called urination sheets.
These were created according to the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first surveying of Bavaria.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French Army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - for military purposes, of course.
Even though French troops finally withdrew with the Lun√©ville peace of February 9, 1801, it was today's neighbors who created the idea of a blanket Bavarian map.
Curator Max IV Joseph continued to drive the project, setting up the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian surveying administration.
The preposition sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and, like all others, can be found on the website of the Bavarian National Library.
The comparison Early / Today is most impressive in the example of the national capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which still appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated 21 years after the creation of the map, in 1877, as a Munich district.
Today, Untersendling is in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstrasse, which was first named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: A smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears at the Hineinzoomen: Handwriting numbered flurries from the so-called "urine recording" from which the property tax was derived.
Small plots no longer occupy farmers there today - but small gardeners of the "Land in Sun" plant.
A large green area looms north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, the site of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historic map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the area of the present district of Au-Haidhausen you read not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the hill "On the skies" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."
Yes, here on Auerfield Road you once barred people with delusions.
It was there in 1858 / 59 that the Munich Circle-Irrenanstalt "On the Auer skies" was created.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the facility - that psychiatrist brought in in connection with the death of King Ludwigs II.
'he was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the chain of so-called lunacy.
He has also banned staff from using violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has been working with the institution for an exhibition.
There had been room for 280 patients at first, and later expanded to 500 places.
Eventually, even that capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair in 1905.
There is since 2006 the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-East, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists.
In the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training businesses.
To the west lies the football pitch of the TSV Munich East, east residential houses from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural reference to the original construction of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed in bomb attacks in World War II.
The Marienplatz was recorded around 1856 as "the main square," the Kaufingerstrasse was called "Kaufinger Gasse."
A decisive change brought World War II to the heart of Munich, too.
The Allies' bombs tore many holes into the city centre in December 1944.
A big one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a Middle Ages greeting chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where the preparatory work is taking place these days and on April 5, 2017, the spade for the second suburban regular line.
With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared to the aerial view of today - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof.
He reports that those waiting in queues on the security cheque repeatedly ask what the problem is and receive the answer from security officials "There's no problem."
By and large, it ran smoothly in most places, though it was also quite inefficient in hospital - people dusted in a long queue.'
I left the polling station at about 17: 00 and the snake was about a kilometre long.
A snake outside a Takoyaki shop.
Ahmad Shuja uploaded a photo via Twitter on which people are in a long queue to receive their election card.
At some polling stations in Malawi, the queues were so long that people could not see the polling at the end of the queue.
"Today the snake is long," she notes while she goes.
Normally there's an extra snake for the students.
"And they've closed the snake for the students, but that's important," Vicki continues, ignoring Arlet.
Civil rights group releases travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors and Algerians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling through the state, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents have been occurring throughout the state lately and are noted here," the group's opinion said.
A recently passed Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement agencies, which disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
'They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten up or killed, "the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "
It is the first such warning the organization has issued for a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year after he had no gasoline during the trip through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The council also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black motorists in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be ready whether to bring in caucus money or let relatives know they're travelling through the state." "
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, which ranked the state 16th in terms of the number of such injuries.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
There are about 13 establishment centres in the northwestern border province, and there are 30 other camps in Belutchistan, but they are smaller.
We must no longer look at the problem, from the point of view of participation or non-participation, and therefore go to one of the two opposing camps.
At the moment, logistical camps, rolling transport and the development of world airports are creating the military conditions for Belutchistan to be brought under control and to reach the Indian Ocean.
Hospitals and police clinics, as well as camps near the border, have been looted.
There are day and night guarded United Nations camps.
The Israeli Government assured the Presidency that security measures around Palestinian camps would be strengthened.
With the reopening of the camps, with the compression of ordinary people's neighborhoods by the police and with mass arrests in the early hours of the morning, the regime wanted to respond brutally, in our view in a scandalous way, to the ever-growing discontent and popular anger at the difficulties and economic failures of the regime.
This organisation has limited responsibility for helping refugees living outside the camps.
Indeed, there are countries in which there is a kind of revolt around the camps, because the local population has the impression that the refugees are better off in the camps than they are.
Their camps are being bombed.
They preserve, as reminders and symbols, the camps of torture and the workshops of death.

Mr President, I will end with the simple statement that we are satisfied with the electoral process, but not so much with demobilisation, because the Honduran Government has prevented the international organisations mentioned in the Tela Convention from visiting the Contras camps recently.
This puts it in the camp of the brakes on European development, those who see the strengthening of the EC as a provocation towards Moscow and Eastern Europe, which is a very regrettable development.
We welcome everything the Commission has done and I am sure that the Commissioner will insist on a thorough investigation of the camps when he visits the camps.
Many were killed in resistance, while others fled to camps in adjacent Papua New Guinea (PNG), but even there they can't feel safe.
I agree with the honourable Member on the importance of maintaining concentration camps for future generations as a testimony to Nazi crimes against humanity, but I believe that the sites of several camps have already been placed under the constant protection of the competent national and local authorities for the reason mentioned by the honourable Member.
I have visited a camp other than Mrs Ewing: A camp of 97 000 refugees on the border with Somalia, maintained by non-governmental organisations, the European Community and other donors.
Without mentioning names, I would like to say that there are two camps for the 'no' people.
However, it seems that several of these camps are under the constant protection of the competent national and / or local authorities.
I thought the old left and Rousseau's utopia had long been buried, responsible for the millions of deaths of the gulag and the camps of communist China.
Parts of the population are deported to camps in the Arab north, with the sole aim of depriving the people of the Nuba of their Christian faith and culture.
The Community and its Member States have also condemned the existence of detention centres, particularly in Bosnia Herzegovina, and have called for the camps to be opened immediately for international inspection and dissolved as soon as possible.
This can also be blamed on the Lebanese Government, which, by refusing to allow the deported Palestinians into the country, and also by refusing to allow aid organisations access to the temporary camp, has no other objective than to exploit the matter for political purposes to the detriment of Israel.
For several weeks, after discovering the camps, we have been discovering the rapes.
This attention and financial support must not be limited to the camps located on Community territory, but must also apply, if not above all, to the camps located in the rest of Europe.

CDU members Peter White and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on the ground.
At the Law Court of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fisherman CDU Local Association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.
Markus Schwendemann initially granted insights into his operation, in which he farmed 55 acres of meadows and 40 acres of forest, supplied 40 dairy cows and as many juveniles and houses holiday homes in five apartments.
The "Black Forest milk" is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, according to Schwendemann.

The disclosure area is thus 40 hectares, which may not be reforested until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of ¬£71 500, half was promoted via Leader, a quarter carried by the municipality of Fischer bach.

"The big advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schwendeman explained.

For the fisherman Weidezaunproject 2018, the application is currently under way by eight participants with 24 plots wishing to build just under 16 kilometres of fence.
The disclosure area is equivalent to 35 hectares, and the calculated cost is more than ¬£112.

Now the White House is taking on Trump's Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
Americans value them as much as anyone else - hence the carefully orchestrated overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump regime's key ideologues, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated battle with Jim Acosta of CNN over the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have blasted him if he had done it.
But he attacked their importance, and in particular the importance attributed to it when Emma Lazarus's famous poem was added to his base in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed.
When Miller summoned Acosta: "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem to which you refer, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
Miller is factually right, but as he put it himself, it's not really about history.
It's about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only one where a state invites not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your troubles, your poor, / your afflicted masses who yearn to breathe freely, / the wretched waste of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "wretched waste" was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's United States.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: It is indeed a conflict over the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends, who campaigned to place their words at the base after her death - knew very well that they carried out a highly political act.
The sculpture was supposed to show the connections between French and American Republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical visual depiction.
Lazarus changed that meaning: In her poem, the female character is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of exiles.
Linking the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this back for a long time.
The great shrine Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty did not invite anyone, but was more of an early neo-conservative bringing the American flame into the enclosed world: "Lady Liberty is going forward.
It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not meant to illuminate the path to the United States. "
Quite unusually, Limbaugh has encountered something here.
The importance of the statue is entirely a matter of the position of perception.
The great fanciful fact of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, wretched but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It's literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And that, of course, is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not intended to illuminate the path, but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of Britain's team
The UK's performance director of athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-man Scottish contingent in the World Cup cadre will "make a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and that the UK's athletics must learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we'll continue it until we figure it out," Black said.
'i speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they've done.
Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they've done.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they did.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant.'
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain by the team.
'Eilidh is pretty modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible, "Black says.
'a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh brought in quite naturally were great. ""
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete at the 400m hurdles at her fifth world championships, says it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Cup so far was seven achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The mid-range runner Muir leads along this path and set five British and two European records last year.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 metres, is another Scot to watch after a great season that included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "hugely proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots will not only be part of the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and finals.
"The special thing about being team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and elected me makes it something very special for me," she added.
'Obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots who are part of the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise to podiums.
As for my speech as captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home World Cup.
So it's really important to put on that home support and benefit from the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such a great atmosphere out there.'
Crucial to the site was our desire to create an audio platform that provides a space for emerging talent from the most diverse areas in the region.
Overall, the European Parliament supported the harmonisation proposals by a large majority, even though some of the victims of those involved and certain deviations from the usual policies in some Member States were called for, because it was clear that, without harmonisation of cost factors and legislation, no great progress could be made towards greater freedom of movement.
The need, the benefits and the gradual implementation of such a project must be recognised and felt by all, so that the advances and the necessary sacrifices are made on a voluntary basis.
But how can we demand these sacrifices from our peoples, our constituents, when the same voters read about such human rights violations every day in the newspaper?
Nevertheless, I believe that farmers are prepared to make these short-term sacrifices so that the health of the people can be improved in the long term.
Mr Berkhouwer pointed out how bitter this is for the athletes who have been victims for years, deprivation to take part in this event.
This is not about refusing to make a sacrifice, but about the lack of time to return to the constituency and return on Monday morning in good time.
The prisoners of Tunis have not died otherwise when their victim triggers a legitimate indictment of the regime of Bourguiba, this expression of the so-called free world, and when they are a confirmation of the need to resist human rights violations wherever they occur.
It is certainly words she has spoken with the feeling of a woman, a democrat, an anti-fascist campaigner who has known the victim.
This is demonstrated by the commitment and the sacrifices - including to people - to which some of the newcomers were and continue to be ready for this country and its people, by providing troop quotas to the UN peacekeeping forces.
But conveying credible values also means convincing others that, if necessary, they are willing to make sacrifices for these values.
In view of this situation, it seems logical that, in return for the victims demanded of milk producers, a co-responsibility levy should also be levied on the fats of plant and maritime origin which are introduced into the Community under preferential conditions.
This also explains the heroic sacrifice of Bobby Sands, O'Hara, Hughes, MacCreesh and Joe MacDonnell, who sadly died yesterday after a 60-day hunger strike, who enjoy the approval and support of Irish Catholics and a large proportion of European and global public opinion.
This is meant by the word "victim."
Our idea demands some sacrifices on the part of the rich.
The Olympic fighters from many countries, who bravely made a huge personal sacrifice, also believed that the Community would keep its promise.
The fact that we are imposing serious sacrifices on ourselves is of no use if our competitors exploit them for their own growth.
And the success of the Camp David agreement just shows that, for the first time in history, the military victors have made material sacrifices in order for peace to return.
This action - it should be said - will require great sacrifices from the population and workers in particular, sacrifices that must appear to them to be lost if they do not clearly find their justification for the efficiency of the installations and a sufficient balance between the surplus and the deficit in production and consumption per capita of the individual Member States.
Thirdly, account must be taken of the great efforts and sacrifices that Luxembourg has made since the beginning of the steel crisis, that is to say since 1975, for the restructuring of its steel industry.
Enlargement would pose a dramatic threat to the Spanish fishing industry, and even this sacrifice could not prevent our production capacity from being significantly reduced.
A great deal of concern has been expressed about the fact that victims - because victims were eventually asked to do so - would have to be brought on an equal footing by farmers in all countries.
We state quite clearly that we do not stand with our backs to the wall and do not need to impose new sacrifices on small and medium-sized farmers; it is also different.
The agriculture ministers were realistic and I know that all our farmers will be prepared to make some sacrifices in order to promote the long-term functioning and stability of the common agricultural policy.
However, the victims must be distributed equally among the Member States, and I strongly reject the idea that British farmers should be worse off than their European counterparts.
Considering that we must all participate equally in the happy and unpleasant events of the Community and that it now requires sacrifices if the economy is to be restarted, we accept the price increase proposals in the Woltjer report.
The members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats even go so far as to call for a fair distribution of victims in the resolution they have signed with others.
We must also remember that if Europe's democratic parties had been vigilant and determined, this sacrifice might not have been necessary for so many.
However, these efforts must continue for a while, otherwise all the sacrifices that have been made so far, particularly in the workplace, would have been pointless.
A civilised state must avoid the sacrifice of the uninvolved.
The economic losses, the number of human victims in the fight against fires, the costs are so high that they can no longer be borne by individual communities, by the Autonomous Communities, by the municipal and municipal authorities, and thus lead to serious economic shocks.
Of course, the cut mentioned fell victim to several important parts of the programme, including, in particular, research in the field of aviation.
It would therefore be unfair to remember only one part of the victims and not to mention the other part.
Now anyone who has a little common sense knows that you have to be able to compromise and make sacrifices when you live together at twelve.
Through this sacrifice, they managed effectively to shake up the international conscience and trigger a wave of solidarity with the Afghan people, which is now culminating in this victory.
But in the name of what objective are we going to demand all these great efforts, all these upheavals, all these victims?
In line with these efforts, producers outside the Community should make similar sacrifices if we are to achieve a more stable balance on world markets.
The Polish people, who have been suffering for years from the shortage and scarcity of basic products, have just embarked on an ambitious process of remediation and economic reforms that will demand further efforts and sacrifices from this courageous and patient people.
The families of the Sellafield workers are now being asked to make an extreme sacrifice.
Only then will all the soldiers of Europe, whose blood is an invisible ornament for the victims of the past, become the doorstep of every house in this area and have soaked every plot in fields, meadows and gardens, only then will all these soldiers who have fallen in battle be able to rest in peace!
On the contrary, they would increase social and national sacrifices, especially for the most vulnerable nations.
They have worked generation by generation and made serious sacrifices.
I will be told that every country must make sacrifices in order to build a well-organised, integrated and efficient community, both small and large.
Pakistan is a country that has already made great sacrifices in the war in Afghanistan with the reception of millions of refugees.
In addition to these very general plans, we should not forget that there are special cases, such as the case of Poland, which, as a whole, was the first to initiate this process of democratisation and which were prepared to make sacrifices when it came to it, has already become the object of demonstration of what our world policy will be and what our real intentions are.
Parliament should approve measures which are conciliatory to the United States, but which require a great sacrifice from the European farmer.
The sinking of fishing boats by submarines can be avoided, and I urge the Commission and the governments of the Member States to agree immediately on appropriate procedures to ensure that the Antares team was the last victim of the Cold War.
We knew that war was the victim in politics.
I believe that the Council must ensure that something is done for the minorities that remain, including in a smaller Yugoslavia; in particular, the victims in Bosnia-Herzegovina also need attention.
The one-net rule proposed will impose different hardships and sacrifices on fishermen in different regions and waters, which will not be fair by the bank.
While this is a unique achievement in the history of international maritime transport (thanks to the self-sacrifice of the crew and the proper coordination of the captain's rescue operations under extraordinarily difficult weather conditions, there was not a single victim), the deliberate defamation was guided by low motives of unfair competition.
We will all have to make sacrifices in our way of life, production and consumption.
Secondly, we need to strengthen the principle of safety and environmental protection, raise standards and European and international controls throughout the cycle, from shipbuilding to ports and shipping, which is essential in order to stop the negative spiral that has led to ever more numerous and serious accidents in recent years, and to prevent wild competition, which is becoming a victim of quality and safety.
That is why both the authorities and the Moroccan public have used their links with the Community as an essential element in their internal political debate, precisely because they have had the opportunity to 'sell' their own people, so to speak, that for a more stable and better future it is necessary to take on these victims.
I wish that governments would set an example to those people who, in the face of such a human tragedy, show more commitment and make greater sacrifices.
However, we wonder whether we have the means to achieve our objectives and whether we have the courage to explain to our people what sacrifices they must make so that we can use sufficient resources to achieve our objectives.
Of course, we cannot be guided by selfishness in the necessary restructuring, but by a clear position on the part of the Commission, so that the victims of the social partners and the investment efforts of recent decades will not have been in vain.
In my country, beef is the most important agricultural export - no other product has this significance - and because we export 80% of our total beef production, the whole GATT problem has enormous weight for us, and it is quite certain that we will have to pay beyond the sacrifices already made in the CAP.
The remediation of the market and the balance between supply and demand are to be found in the restriction of production, even if this solution is difficult in the face of the victims involved.

Block from critics over Facebook: Don't bother for a public office if you can't tolerate the heating up of voters
The father of our country knew something of bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to beat him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.
He laughed at the criticism, for sure.
But he has not silenced his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said: "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and blunt, we are led like the sheep to slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's staff have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have voiced their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Na, and?"
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it's important.
And it's particularly important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming Democratic state that is astonishingly popular.
He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.
He has shown a firm hand in running his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very adept at using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his constituents and playing his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, blocking people coming on the side of the governor - which is a public forum that is described as official and by staff paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people swinging the whip online.
The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people talking to their elected leaders: A teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the commentary section of the news show The Post.
'i don't appreciate this idea either, when a number of people take a position on the same issue, they are more likely to be disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort and not recognised as a large group of affected citizens.'
What the governor's staff described as a "concentrated spam attack," others would likely call "advocacy."
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past, if you had done the same, that staff were dispatched to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or to arrest and silence protesters.
But that's exactly what's just happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for plotting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on this issue fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable port had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers lashed out at his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers making Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticising his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project's online papers.
But he didn't silence them.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse are the foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
A week after a preliminary deal was made public, the two banks said that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's common shares at the uniform price of $25.25, implying a total of $3 billion.
The price accepted is below 19% of the share price of 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in acquiring convertible shares, which will secure its 10% profit and can be sold again at a cost of $31.25.
The last few weeks have been tough for the group, which has seen its stock price fall by half, while the price of insurance against default has soared.
That price declined Monday but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
On the 17th, two dead women covered in blankets were discovered in the settlement of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning, Huixquilucan found the body wrapped in a yellow-and-blue blanket of a man likely named Mario R√≠os, according to the news that his killers left next to him.
Given the dense smog that burns in the throat and settles like a blanket over China's larger cities in a few days, improving air quality in China is one of the most pressing environmental issues.
This is to say that they should invest more in innovative projects than in those that offer "safe social returns" - for example, a certain number of blankets made with donations.
The ADQ has advocated supporting the government's adoption of a plan North.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort at Renaissance Club
Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for domestic comfort over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led next door in the Archerfield links to the finals last year before losing to Paul Eales, has been linked to the new venue and serves as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi.
"I saw how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how he achieves his fame with this event," Rafferty said.

An existing movement gearing up for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea encompassing the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as secluded as it is. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive by car.
There is no public transport.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and corrugated sheet roofs converted by rust into various yellow-brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans honored a god called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes, too.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," Degei says, pointing to her lively, hand-woven turban, her dark shirt and her bright skirt.
"We used to have only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's Goldland.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran of Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Panai, a highland province the size of New Jersey with 153,000 residents.
In 2015 alone, Freeport dismantled $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
Moreover, Papua has timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papua, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 investigation in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuvian demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden Gans and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970 "s became genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
"We Are Everything Losing" says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane that includes reports of last year's atrocities, such as unlawful executions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular, according to another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have intensified as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanesian hot canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people struggle to stay here.
"The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," explains abeth You, a 24-year-old panicked native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura to work.
'it has cost the indigenous Papua - the mum-mum [the women] of Papua - their market.'
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised to address the inequalities and rights violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former Zimmermann secured 27 of Papua's 29 districts - including Scanai - en route to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
Indeed, just two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October, Scanai suffered a low point.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them they should turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offense at her tone and later came back with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers, who had been drinking, yelled and beat the group with their rifle collies, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeinfo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered on a football pitch outside the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting arches and performed the Waita dance - in the circle running and a birdsong imitating - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began hurling rocks at police and military posts.
As the mood heated up, the soldiers were sent a command of an internal radio: "If the crowds resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," according to an official document from TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of Enarotali's Kego Koto district, saw the threat and called for calm and urged the crowd to return home.
Nobody was listening in the mood.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, a lot of shots were fired," he adds.
Indigenous man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was," Yohanes, who like many Indonesians bears only one name, told TIME in a gloomy mood.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
The Papua police's chief inspector, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" her station because she was being attacked.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," the spokesman for Papua police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, said in 2015.
"It's about life and death." "
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
News of the killings came only the following day 'filtered' to Jakarta.
Three weeks Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura in which he expressed sympathies for the victims' families and vowed to address the historical grievances in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so it won't happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was establishing an out-of-court mechanism for settling historic human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90 "s and early 2000" s.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to be gone through, "he said.
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5 and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, whom the UN has charged with "crimes against humanity," which claimed more than 1,000 fatalities in East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been settled, including the Panai incident.
Families of the panic victims took such claims with grim disbelief.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress whatsoever," Yohanes says.
"I'm tired." "
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid to be arrested by the military, afraid to be shot." "
His brother, Yacobus, reiterated the view that people in Scanai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military was looking after me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Panais neighbourhood of Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had drowned when he fished in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested outside the company's location office.
Police said villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one.
"We were so panicked, we're afraid there will be revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly hospitalized here, according to TIME.
"I was hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for the police's mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a troublemaker for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the dissatisfaction of the tribesmen Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend Papua's rights by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Scanai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, in recent years, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily taken into custody, on the pretext of "safeguarding national sovereignty."
Some never appear again.
Among the people of Papua, Panai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty strengthens discontent.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here build everything they eat: Especially Nota and fruit and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the job of women, who can each process four or five fields of sweet potato.
They retain most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic disparities have grown between the indigenous Papua and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of the Panai tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
Moreover, restrictions on reporting remain fraught with international media.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck ESCUDEN and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, although they were given rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi's campaign to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new dangers to foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: Visa denial and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
Lack of press scrutiny means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread injuries" in Papua, including the Panai shootings.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's allegations and told journalists in Jakarta: "A democratic system still applies in Indonesia, and there is free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
Local people want more foreign governments to take note.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and pressed him "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but wishes to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the panic shots," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, the panicked people are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the panicked people, like other Papua, view their vote for Jokowi as a "fault" he has to repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the panicked shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: The body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they don't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus says with a soaked head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire captures the 'Torch' skyscraper of Dubai for the second time
A fire took place on Friday in one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-foot-tall, 79-storey building.
It's the second fire to sweep through the high-rise in just two years, which is randomly called the Torch Tower (torch tower).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame.
'We've slept and we've stood up at the fire alarm and at the shouting of people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor, "one resident, who gave his name as George, told Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said that units of fire fighting at about 4 a.m. local time (00.00 GMT) extinguished the fire and cooled the building.
The government said it was working on providing accommodation for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage came from the disguise, outdoor lining to decoration or insulation.
In the UK, police said they believe the system of plates for insulation and disguise at London's Grenfell Tower in June may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died.

No Davis Cup reform: Continue best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has fallen through with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho-Chi-Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup singles only on two winning sets was razor-thin not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-sentence classics, which are often very long, but which are also very much appreciated, therefore remain the traditional competition.
63.54 per cent of member states voted in favour of the reform, so the goal of ITF president David Haggerty was narrowly missed.

Nevertheless, it should be remembered that, a few days before the attack in Catalonia, several thousand dollars had been sent through a money-transfer company to "invest" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "command" that put an end to the lives of 106 people.
As is generally known, the two players lost a few minutes before playing (their team had already clearly won) time and played several fouls so the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would lead his group, the two players will meet the prescribed sanction at the next league game against the Auxerre and thus enter the next phase of the game without cards.
The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more common in the world of football.
The advantage, obviously, is that players start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 was supposed to end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phone), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most tragic segment here is contactless technology, which allows payments in public transport or settlement of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Their market share should increase even further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent over 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Some 26 million visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
"Jane, your little feet are naked; put to me in bed and cover you with my blanket."
On the other side of the square were tent busts, in which cotton goods, blankets and stockings were haggled, alongside horse shells and clusters of colourful ribbons whose ends fluttered in the winds.
He asked K. to give him a blanket from the canapee.

Throwing off the ceiling was quite simple; he just needed to blow himself up a little and she fell by herself.

In a small, dirty room, whose engraved wall panelling was articulated, and through whose thin wall you could hear a conversation next door, in an air filled with the suffocating smell of unclean things, there was a body wrapped in a blanket on a wall-covered bed.
The one arm of this body was located above the ceiling, and the vastly large hand, similar to a hark, was incomprehensibly attached to a thin, from beginning to center equally strong, long stick.
It did not come to his mind to see all the details in the state of the sick, to think about how this body was under the ceiling there, in what curved attitude these depleted lower legs and hips and this meagre back were stored, and whether it was not somehow possible to store them better, to do something to ensure that the sick, if they were not actually better off, did not have it quite as bad.
The wheelbarrow was brought up, the body displayed, wrapped with a blanket and stuck with knitting.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. travelers bring banned items to the plane, a survey finds
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously banned items smuggled past the checkpoints of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while accidentally carrying banned knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed they had belatedly discovered that they had mistakenly traveled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers were more likely to disregard the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared with less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items intentionally passed to TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 per cent said they knowingly carried items with blades through the safety check, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the plane.
The company said it had interviewed travelers across the country to find out how many had accidentally brought contraband through airport security and how many had done it intentionally.
It's no surprise that the people most likely to carry contraband - knowingly or unwittingly - through safety were those most likely to fly.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure what liquids they are allowed to take or how much of it.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of items seized by the TSA are banned liquids.
For a time, people thought the TSA could view books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Electro-thousand sassa Elon Musk likes to enter with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3."
In doing so, he has so far implied that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-triumphant numbers on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has, for the first time, betrayed a different, less lackluster number in announcing the latest quarterly record: That of cancellations in the new mass-market Model 3.
Musk had frequently campaigned in recent months with the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.
Now Musk concedes: Of the total 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are merely non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will pay back the $1,000 (in the US $1,000 and in the UK $1,000) "reservation payment" fully.
Currently, 455,000 such non-binding reservations were available, Musk acknowledged in a conference call with analysts.
That cancellation of about 12 percent of all orders so far could become a problem, however, the Tesla boss does not believe.
His argument: The challenge of ambitious growth targets lies not in demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018 - all models put together - it is expected to be 500,000, in 2020 a million.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, 1800 reservations are currently coming in each day.
If you order a "Model 3" today, you can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand-new, never-tested production roads with maximum utilization without major interruptions.
Many experts doubt this is possible.
But if there are major delays, then the non-binding of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent disaffected customers from running away in droves.
EPA chief Pruitt withdraws because of the delay of Obama-Era's rules to reduce emissions
A day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, retracted his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the lawsuit, which had been filed against his previous post in a federal appeals court.
It's about a deadline that expired on October 1 for states to meet the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth."
Pruitt, who was the prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry oppose.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay implementation of a rule by the Obama administration that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Pruitt suggested that his U-turn on ozone standards simply strengthens the EPA's willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for execution and then waited to be indicted by activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the date for execution," said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
'We don't believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously. "
Yet the EPA's opinion said that Pruitt will eventually use his "power to delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules are "based on sound policy and the best available information."
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader recast of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is expected to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal - after our lawsuits - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone arises when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere respond to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered on Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It's disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the Trump administration's ideological crusade to turn to polluters and their special interests."
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by an ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.

Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen is invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 p.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth fundraising serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the place have made the friends and patrons of Tumlingens their concern.
Walter Martini stresses: "It's a unique village gem."
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the W√ºrttemberg certificate: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen along with the Vogbey" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.
According to the text of the document, on Tumlinger Berg apart from the former parish church there was also a stately courtyard, to which the church or patronage law belonged, and not the other way round.
So there were also people living there.
As evidenced by the description of the Upper Office of Freudenstadt of 1858, in addition to the Lower Village and the Upper Village, which are now visible in the local image of Tumlingen, the "mountain" was the third, the stately settlement core of the village.
Old maps from around 1600 underpin these historical realities.
Patronage law arose from early medieval own-church law.
A gentleman who built a church, equipped it and occupied it with a pastor remained the owner of that church and was able to inherit this own church.
Related to this was the right to deploy a pastor or propose to the bishop a new pastor.
Three altars were in the church and two bells on the tower.
The bigger of the two crumbled on Christmas 1673.
The newly created bell then sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be surrendered later in World War II in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648), the window windows were taken and the bell parts were stolen.
The roof was leaky.
In 1796, French troops stored near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as a final resting place for the dead from hearing Swiss.
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilarius Church broke down.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the church tower and half crashed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was aborted.
Only the tower dwarf that still exists today was preserved as a witness to the 750 years of church history.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "sheepish pensioners" in place of Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius plant.
As organisers, the friends and patrons invite Tumlingens on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade to the old cemetery to the St. Hilarius Chapel.
This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with speeches by Kurt Kubler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local resident Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 4: 30 p.m.
Admission is from 3: 30 p.m.
To sound out the serenade, a nightcap takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with the wide view over meadows towards the forest," the organisers put out the fantastic view.
The serenade takes place only in dry weather.
Organisers are hoping for many supporters to preserve the historic St Hilarius facility, which is important for tumblers and hearing swiss.
The friends and patrons of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini reaffirms.
Club to consider approval of wind turbines
"Boisheim wrestles" sees no legal requirement for construction and has therefore contacted the county council.
The association "Boisheim wrestles" has asked Councillor Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nets.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nets, no wind turbines could have been approved at all, as at the time in Foursen there was only a wind power concentration zone on the city border with Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are, in principle, possible, but at the same time the concentration zone excludes the use of wind energy for the rest of the urban area.
Such zones are designed to prevent a "saving" of the landscape.
While the city of Foursen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nets a few days earlier by changing the land-use plan - but that had not been approved by the Dusseldorf district government, because of a form error.
"Due to the lack of a planning requirement, the permit bill granted is still unlawful and therefore also take back," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim wrestles."
Current state of affairs: The city council once again approved the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nets before the summer break; a approval from the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "Thus, at this point, the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded under planning law."
The circle confirms the receipt of the call.
"The relevant letters have been received since last week at the District of Foursen," a spokesman explained.
The county takes them to the occasion to re-examine the matter.
But they are unlikely to result in the proceedings being halted.
With regard to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, the county on Thursday declined to comment on the substance of the association's reasoning "Boisheim wrestles."
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans to build four per 200-metre wind turbines on an area on the Boisheimer Nets.
Earlier last year, the company, in which the city of Foursen is indirectly involved, closed lease contracts with the owner of the roughly 65-acre area.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of some 11,400 households will be able to be met - equivalent to around one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four-seater households.
The NEW Re wants to invest about $20 million.
Last summer, Foursen City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen, as well as a stake in a wind energy plant in √úbach-Palenberg in Heinsberg County.
'it belongs to us, it's our future, 'he added, after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
So emphasizing the civilian character and the form of association is not just a way of bypassing the legal hurdles that might arise in the course of court registration - it is also a political strategy.

City and traders plan 'home shopping' weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are expected to rediscover shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade association and the city council want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to lure residents to the shopping spree in the city centre.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian King, announced, the "home shopping" weekend is designed to raise customers' awareness of what offers their own city has away from the usual supermarket commodity.
A market with regional suppliers is therefore planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local firms are expected to present themselves with their apprenticeships.
In addition, downtown shops are expected to invite "midnight shopping."
In doing so, the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the vicinity of the region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an internet video and printed pouches pointing to the action weekend, according to Christian King.
City administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
This will take the trade association and the city to another stage of the "Attractive city centre" project.
These include new offerings such as the first "active day" to the fountain festival along with selling Sunday, talks with all tradesmen and hosts to encourage them to actively participate.
Attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees that day are also part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential should be reopened or reopened.
These include spa guests and tourists.
But many locals have also lost the city centre while shopping out of view.
In the end, everyone would have to help revive the city centre - up to landlords, the businesses of the whole city and clubs.
It was intended to overcome lethargy with a network that has partly spread, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Stafford, head of the IHK Center in M√ºhlhausen told reporters that on the country's third "home shopping" day, five Thuringia cities are participating for the first time.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, S√∂mmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance to the common good of our cities," Stafford added.
The action, under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners, also makes it clear that any citizen with their buying behaviour can influence their direct environment themselves.

The report concludes: "To meet global demand, private-sector investment must increase by a factor of $20-30 to $200-300 billion a year, on the assumption that government and philanthropic resources will double."
The essence of the "This time is different" syndrome lies in the assumption that crises affect only others.
Behind this is the assumption that behind the longest chain is a majority of users.

Under the optimistic assumption that government spending and philanthropy will double in the medium term, private-sector investment must increase by a factor of 20-30 in order to meet the required financial needs.
Assuming that the added value of the suppliers falls in Switzerland, the purchases of the big banks generate an added value of about 2.4 billion francs and 19 275 jobs.

Trump, after leaked transcripts of phone calls, put Mexico under pressure for paying the border wall
Transcripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump urged in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US president summoned him for publicly denouncing the wall, and reportedly said to him: "You can't tell the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States, and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade deal for the U.S. refugees emigrating to Australia was "ridiculous," "mies" and "stupid" and that insisting on trade brokered by the Obama administration would make him look like a "Depp" after he proposed a ban on resettling refugees to the United States.
Mr. Trump ended the call after telling Mr. Turnbull that "this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
I was led to a host house, where the conduit asked me to dine; but, because I had no appetite, he left me alone in a large room, at whose two ends there was ever a fireplace; a chandelier hung down from the ceiling, and on top of the wall was a small, red gallery on which various musical instruments were located.
And all this you see at the glow of an oil lamp that hangs down from the ceiling, and that of a bright fireplace, next to which I sit in coat and hat; my muff and umbrella are on the table, and I try to recover at the warmth of the furnace from the stiffness and anesthesia, which had a six-hour journey in cold octoberia.
After I had walked along the long gallery covered with carpets, I went down the brilliantly bare oak staircase; then I came into the hall; here I stood a minute still; I looked at some copper stitches on the walls, - even today I remember the same, one represented a finest looking man in a chisel; the other a lady with puffed hair and a pearl carved on the walls.
She climbed down from her chair and came to me to sit on my lap; then she seriously folded her little hands, threw her locks back, stitched her eyes on the ceiling of the room and began singing a tune from any opera.
It was a large, stately Gemach, with purple-coloured furniture and curtains, a Turkish carpet, nude wood-clad walls, a large coloured window and a richly carved ceiling.
I still see her in her tossing passion when we had driven her to the extreme - she shed our tea, crumbled our butter broth, threw our books up to the ceiling emptied and made a colourful mess with the lineal and the writing desk, the camingite and the fire range.
Right, and faster than she expected: Before she had half-drowned the flask, she felt like her head was hitting the ceiling, and had to bump quickly to avoid breaking her neck.
Through the rites of wood, the sun's rays stained with long thin needles on the tiles, or they broke down at the edges of the furniture and swirled up to the ceiling.
"If you knew," she continued, beating her beautiful eyes, from which tears rolled, to the ceiling emptied, "which I dreamed of all!"
The interior of the cottage was as decaying as the old; its walls tinted, the beams of the ceiling swarmed, the fireplace collapsed, spinnewebs hung on all corners; in the middle stood a series of shaky tables and crumbling shells, in the ashes sat a dirty child, and in the back of the corner one looked up a staircase or rather a wooden ladder.
During this passionate declaration of love, the Gypsy woman sent to the dirty ceiling that represented the sky here, a look full of heavenly happiness emptied.
The young girl bumped, raised her eyes to the ceiling, fell backwards and trembling all over his body, under his kiss.
On a sign Charmolue's put her back on the bed, and two raw fists attached to her tender body the strap that hung down from the ceiling.
A crowd of diverse people - no one cared for the incoming one - filled a medium-sized, two-storey room, just around the ceiling, surrounded by a gallery that was also fully staffed, and where people could only stand and hit the ceiling with their heads and backs.
But not she circled, but the man, he had pulled his mouth wide and glanced to the ceiling.
Although there was no immediate access to light, it was not completely dark, because some departments were opposed to the corridor, rather than to uniform board walls, but to the ceiling of wooden grids, through which there was some light and through which individual officials could also be seen writing at tables or standing straight at the grid and watching the people on the aisle through the gaps.
Especially on the top of the ceiling, he liked to hang; it was very different from lying on the floor; one breathed more freely; a slight twinkle went through the body; and in the almost happy dispersion in which Gregor was up there, it could happen that, to his own surprise, he let himself go and clapped on the floor.
"Under the ceiling and against the wall she will go."

Moores Ford massacre: Activists perform racist lynch act as call for justice resumes
A 1948-born Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled onto Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men stepped out with guns to block its path.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle strike suit - took a long turn at his cigar and glanced checking through the windshield.
Indoors, the inmates were floating in fear.
"We want this n -- -- r Roger!" Roared the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
Cries ripped apart the silence when a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Luckily, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22, is just a follow-up.
But if then a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger," almost everyone in the audience encountered very real sigh.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have come back to Moore's Ford Bridge to emulate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were yellowed by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It's really unfathomable that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the follow-up.
'it's a dirt stain on a story, but it's a burden on our souls.'
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifetime civil rights activist.
For him, the follow-up serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want law enforcement, we want termination, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need to get justice," he said.
'We can't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice.'
A forensic examiner lays a bed towel over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process.
But none have ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say that the dual motivation for the Lynch actions across the city has always been known: Politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision allowed black citizens in Georgia to cast their votes for the first time in the primary campaign in the summer.
Roughly at the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black color prosecutor Roger Malcom stole a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumour in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was escorted to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they then moved away from prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," an FBI report concludes.
'it's also obvious that there was a plot between state and local law enforcement that was not only involved in the killings, eliminated evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses'.
Brooks puts it even more succinctly.
"It was a suffrage massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community:" If you register and if you vote, that will happen to you here. "
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual replica of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their portrayal is vivid, moving, and rooted in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynching because then we will be confronted with its hemorrhage in all of us," she said.
'but I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through '.
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of blacks - pushed into a room and listened when Greene launched a well-recorded overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Greenes co-director here.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Marbaugh said.
'but I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return to these times.'
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The play begins with Malcom shouting at Hester and pressuring him, furious that he has slept with his wife Dorothy.
'i said, n -- er, disappear from my property! '
Rascona reciprocated the fire.
There's a pause.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) erupts into laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!" Asked Rascona.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too tough?
"No," Greene said, still casually.
'i just don't think white people at the time said 'n -- he' .'
"But," quipped one of the other black performers.
'you just have to hit the hard 'R.' .'
And that's exactly where the energy in the room shifts, a sense of camera crew replacing the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely nobody laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are cries, shots and then silence.
A woman, wearing a funeral dress, stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holidays's grieving praise "Strange Fruit."
Her voice breaks at every second word.
Roughly a hundred feet behind it, a group of about four dozen spectators sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly split between black and white.
A couple have travelled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just coming down the street.
They have all experienced nearly eight hours of Georgia's crushing moisture when Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the burial sites of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to that point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now when you're on the same land where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels spooky.
When the last notes of the song end, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body name.
Children hover on their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"You're not really dead," murmured one little boy, as if to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his fellow players and then collapses in their arms crying together, the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaking through on him.
"It's okay," whispered one of the women.
'We know that's not in your heart.
You did that for a reason. ""
Later, the audience sit down with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chatted about the follow-up with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words about what feeling the performance left behind.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds... coming from people who look like yourself and who do that because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does with me is let me believe that the lynching is still going on," she added, "today this is just called police shootings."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, he eats and recalls civil rights.
He said he had already started planning the performance next year.
"The follow-up is inspiring in a way, because it describes the horror of what we've endured, but it's also a moment of learning," he said.
'it's like if we don't learn anything from it, then it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, those who do not know their own history, are condemned to repeat it. "
'Divine Dawn 'reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Even in the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf relies on a colorful-frivolous staging in front of gigantic, six-storey backdrop.
The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) optionally shows a shabby street corner along with Mauerrest and D√∂nerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes vintage car parked where the Rhine daughters pose as Rockergirls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels recall Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - which moves through its "ring" staging.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as they did in "Rhine gold."
Kess seduced her Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), wrecking a corpse in the boot in Hollywood style and giving the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the delightfully nasty hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he beats Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) must also believe in it.
The audience thanks it to the ensemble with strong applause.
Stormy celebrations include Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who are humble and bending hands to the Mercury Raute.
There is great applause for the festival orchestra, which is showing up on stage for the first time - given the big heat back in empty recreational clothes.
Eagerly awaited was the appearance of Frank Castorf and his regime team.
Had he yet to endure a ghastly pipe concert about himself in 2013, there was great jubilation five years later, in which the sporadic "Buh" cries went down.
Marquee leader Katharina Wagner is likely to have been pleased about it.
"You realize that the audience has grown up with the" ring "in a way," she had said shortly before the dpa's performance.
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it also grew an understanding of his view.
I draw a positive reshuffle.
Almost everyone -- except companies like ExxonMobil or US Vice President Dick Cheney and their bought henchmen and misguided followers -- understands that carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere when people burn hydrocarbons, and that CO2 there acts like a huge blanket that absorbs infrared radiation coming from below and warms the earth.
Sufficient brightness, good contrast, fluidity and decoding of the screen surface as well as high resolution and proper dimensioning of the characters are important for the readability of the representation.
The finer the resolution of the screen, that is, the more "image points" are available per character, the better the readability of the information becomes.
Graphic screens usually have a higher resolution than screens that are only intended to display letters and digits.
In practice, you can determine the effect of resolution and display quality through an examination of whether or not certain critical characters can be easily confused; couples are easily interchangeable characters:

Other databases with a higher resolution can be used within the case studies.
Among the international projects at regional and continental level, the CORINE and CORINE Phare projects at the EEA, which, using TM recordings that achieve high resolution and accuracy, produce soil cover information for Europe, are particularly important.
At this stage they do not contain remote sensing images with complete resolution, although some samples of lower quality are available.
The five basic properties that describe soil cover (wood-like, grass-like, bald soil, artificial (buildings), waters) can easily be determined with Earth observation data (both low and high resolution) across large areas for mapping purposes.
This option has allowed the creation of a high-quality card base, with an expected geometric accuracy of 2.5 m (RMS) and a resolution of 1m.
In this case, with a geometric resolution of 1m each point can be clearly located, with the exception of items whose resolution would be less than 1 metre.
The above rule of thumb must be revised if the geometric resolution of the image is low, that is, if a significant proportion of the objects whose area one would like to estimate are lost by the presence of mixing pixels.
On the other hand, there is still a great deal of development and research to be done in the field of agrometeorological models and the methods for monitoring vegetation with medium-resolution satellites.
Currently, Geostat's geographic information system contains not only grid and point data with a resolution of 1 ha, but also various vector files. The GEOSTATProject includes two project units in addition to project organization and management: The service station and the IT group.
Integration, management and maintenance of various geocodized, spatially relevant data available in the Swiss Federal Administration; these data are intended to cover the entire country and have a spatial resolution of 100 m, which corresponds to a map scale of 1: 25 000;
Data on the surface development of a smaller number of land-use categories (possibly 20 or less) with less spatial resolution and accuracy could be published 1 or 2 times a year in order to close the data gap resulting from the fact that areal statistics can only be produced every 12 years on the basis of aerial images.
Remote sensing provides the data according to geometric mesh of different sizes depending on the resolution of the sensor (pixels).
In addition to the characteristic program, the scale and geometric resolution (smallest different space unit), the nomenclature and the periodicity of the survey play a crucial role.
With regard to the selection of sampling fields, however, in the first year of investigation in 1990, it became apparent that very small fields in the relatively small geometric resolution of the currently available image material (LANDSAT TM: 30, 30 m) could hardly be made visible in the satellite image.
For the calculations, six of the seven spectral channels of the LANDSATrecordings were first used in July 1990 and April and July 1991; the thermal channel remained excluded because it causes too many mixing pixels at the parcell limits because of its low resolution (120-120 m2).
However, the intended improvement of the spectral resolution in the LANDSAT 6 will in any case have a positive impact on the usability of smaller training fields.
Satellite images of higher resolution (SPOT, LANDSATTM 6, 15 minutes 15 m2) should therefore be available as soon as possible; at the same time, it should be examined whether, by including additional statistical and / or meteorological parameters in the correlation calculations, sufficient levels of determination and satisfactory confidence intervals of the earnings estimate can be achieved.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry began in 1987, with support from the ITA consortium, using satellite data with high geometric and spectral resolution to carry out estimates of cultivated land and crop yields, supplemented by sampling data from land-use surveys to 4,500 land segments of 50 and 100 hectares.
An initial attempt to combine this survey with satellite data took place in 1981 with an image of Landsat MSS, but did not yield convincing results, which was attributed to the inadequate resolution of the sensor MSS.
It has also been shown that the regression estimate can be used for both points of land data collected and segments, provided that there is a satellite with sufficient resolution, and SPOT seems more suitable for this area of application than Landsat TM.
A finer spatial resolution is necessary to be able to study effects on the environment.
Different applications in different geographical areas require a different resolution and accuracy in the estimate of geophysical parameters.
For example, geostationary satellites can capture an area of a fifth of the Earth's surface in thirty minutes and provide images with a resolution of 5 or 2.5 km.
Some of the problems raised by the project are mentioned, including the difficulty of obtaining consistent multitemporal data, the problem of developing a consistent and generally accepted classification, and the limits on the mass and dissolution of other amounts of data that must combine land use data.
PC with Pentium 100 MHz (minimum) - 16 MB RAM (minimum) - CD-ROM drive with four times speed (minimum) - 15 MB free disk space - screen: Super VGA, 256 colors (resolution 640, 480) - Windows 95.
The development of a method to produce high-resolution microradiographies from irradiated shellfish has improved the quality of post-radiation tests.
The resolution of REM is about 20 nm, the upper limit here is at least 1000 micrometers.
The main obstacle to classical imagery is bandwidth: With traditional telephone lines, it is still difficult to transmit an image of good resolution with sufficiently high repeat frequency to really give the impression of movement.
The image contractor developed by IMEC provides a better resolution in the middle of the image (according to the Fovea) than on its edge (Retina), using a very limited number (8013) of image points.

The correlation spectrometers use correlation technology to improve the resolution otherwise limited by the specifically long reactor pulse.
The centerpiece of the project is "MGW," a "smart media streaming server" that allows content to be distributed on separate networks where the audio / video bit rate, resolution and format are changed.
The Space Apphcations Institute, a member of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), has published a report outlining a new methodology for depicting Europe's forests using an advanced high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR).
The measuring device is based on the application of a SupraspektralSensor with corresponding spatial resolution, which is potentially supplemented by an infrared sensor with a lower resolution;
This will be the first time that such a "snapshot" of the planet Earth has been put together in terms of resolution and capture / cover.
The themes of the projects presented were: Ways of supporting Altimetri to predict climate change, monitoring marine pollution, using Earth observation to assess the health of European forests, the PELCOM project, the aim of which is to create an "updated" map of Europe with a resolution of 1 km, assessing the impact of UV radiation and monitoring of ozone levels.
The data should be obtained based on the output of meteorological models and low-resolution satellite data.
The third lot involves managing a processing chain for satellite data with low resolution.
Operation of the MARS de data includes data derived from a global circulation model, satellite data with low resolution and derived products; mapping and providing the results; updating the associated MARS database.
Siemens dealt with data quality, as fixed models require a much higher resolution and accuracy than normal scans.
Finally, it has entrusted the √âcole National Sup√©rieure de Physique de Strasbourg (ENSPS) with the development of a high-speed memory card, which can store 2000 images with the full resolution of 512-512 pixels.
The resolution of this vectorial equation according to the coordinates leads to the accelerations in x, y and z directions.
An excerpt from a measuring letter is reproduced in picture 43, with two times the signal frequency, of which once with high resolution, is recorded.
One advantage of the empirical over the teoretical identification of categories is that it is so possible to determine their general applicability and reliability in the resolution of ambiguities in real texts.
In turn, the resolution takes place in the initial language; if at the same time it is translated into several languages, individual meanings can only be entered into these programmes at certain points.
This could lead to an increase in the resolution of the ultrasound test.
For reasons of higher accuracy (greater resolution) in the simulation of the hybrid calculator and the uniform standardisation of the entire road for any schedules, the coefficients of the linearized rolling road model for sollvalue deviations were calculated and multiplied with factors for amplitude standardisation.
A full volume tasting with a high resolution radar (like the one in Chilbolton) would take too long.
Of these data, those with the low resolution (10 s) were only used to examine long thumbs (greater than 32 s), while those with the high resolution were used to describe the process as a whole.
The shortcomings there, such as insufficient resolution and too long response times, are currently a major obstacle to the inclusion of certain innovation-related information in databases.
The IRSID (47) research project uses a new generation of X-ray radiation detectors with photo diode lines, which allows the simultaneous collection of a large number of measuring points with equal accuracy, but with a finer resolution than with existing measuring devices.
However, the use of the new resolution has the advantage that it is now possible to see the differences in surface temperature over the length of the permeated absorbers.
The dissolution of this model of price flexibility is achieved by balancing supply and demand.
The dissolution of the model leads us to set three marginal quotas.
Improving non-destructive methods with high spatial and temporal resolution that characterise, for example, bioactive interfaces (structure, function, stability) and the design of miniaturized converters for devices based on biological function.
The possibility of linking images of high and low resolution, which were simultaneously recorded by the same platform, allows for a much more accurate analysis.
A zoom effect with high resolution and the same spectral bands make it possible to better describe virtually every image point.
The radiometric resolution has been adjusted to measure the differences caused by soil growth - and not just the large contrasts that meteorologists need.
Using the NOAA (National Oc√©anography and Atmospheric Administration) footage from the American weather observation satellites, the GFS has produced a map of all the Earth's tropical forests.
This inventory was only possible as a result of several technological developments in the field of radar wave probes (microwave sands) with low spatial resolution.
Their aim is to monitor the development of tropical forest areas almost simultaneously through the combined use of images with both low and high resolution.
The high resolution images then enable the affected region to be analysed in detail and to accurately determine the size of the existing forest areas.
A new type of sonar ‚Ä¢ In the field of marine engineering and in the context of the project ACID (Acoustic Imaging Development) a new generation of sonars has been developed, the special feature of which is that they provide images whose resolution is independent of the distance between the detector and the target object.
(Resolution by the Annual General Meeting)
By scanning documents, the contents of paper pages can be stored as a computer file containing an image of the output document with a specific resolution.
The resolution of a scanner is expressed in "dots per inch" (dpi).
Color scanners can currently easily reach a resolution of 300 or 600 dpi.
The resolution of a fax scanner is much lower (100 to 200 dpi).
Due to the low resolution and poor expression quality, optical character recognition for faxes is often difficult to apply.
Henning T. cracks two cables from the stereo, knocks them to a noose and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
It called on governments in the region to commit to sustainable land use and sustainable facilities that are not at the expense of Southeast Asia's natural resources - mainly forests.
Some investors seem to be betting on safe assets such as gold.
For this, investors in Europe hold, on average, more than 34% short-term assets, compared to 14% in the US.
For this, short-term assets in Europe are more than twice as weighted.
Especially for small countries such as Switzerland, where the opportunities for the dispersion of assets and the selection of securities are limited due to the size of the domestic capital market, the value investment abroad is of great importance.
In recent years, the economy has benefited greatly from global demand for US assets, especially debt in the form of securities that financed a large current-account deficit.
The whole financial universe - assets and trade - has been increasingly covered for 100 years as hardly in any other financial market:
In the past, sustainable investment was mainly about filtering out plants in "poorly regarded" industries such as alcohol, guns, and tobacco.
Such assets, as well as holdings or cash reserves, form the asset side.
What about currency risk - should assets be hedged?
In a broad comparison, we therefore assume that the risk-yield ratio of assets to emerging markets will improve in the future.
The plant guru Jim Rogers once said that at a plant in emerging markets, it would be best to buy what emerging markets themselves buy, namely commodities.
A new era of sustainable assets
Initial approaches only excluded plants in "scapegoating" sectors such as alcohol, weapons or tobacco.
At Credit Suisse, we define sustainable investment as the explicit recognition that environmental, social, and governance factors can affect companies "ability to generate long-term returns.
Our research methodology for sustainable assets begins with an analysis of sustainability opportunities and risks that can fundamentally affect a company's ability to ensure its profitability.
Why are sustainable assets and sustainable companies receiving so much more public attention today than they did a decade ago?
As a result of disasters like Fukushima or Deepwater Horizon, investors are asking themselves how their assets affect the environment and society.
The recent market turmoil has also increased awareness of sustainable assets.
Do you expect the trend towards sustainable assets to be limited to purely niche areas such as environmental technology, or will the consideration of ESG criteria be established as a permanent trend among investors worldwide?
We want to offer investors our know-how in the field of sustainable investments, play a visible and important role in this and, at the same time, participate in the steady growth in this area.
For investment and banking products, the consultation process, the instruments we offer and, most importantly, our employees, "Pauli adds.
"Returns are important, no question," Pauli explains, "but good advice, including a clear rationale that speaks for or against a plant, is just as significant."
"Investing has become a very complex issue," explains Nicole Pauli, "and at some point product specialists are required to have specific, detailed knowledge of a plant."
For example, asset-management specialists for assets in funds and alternative assets, or investment bankers for strategic choices such as an IPO or merger, and eventually private-banking advisers for private-asset management.
For example, Value Investing goes to Benjamin Graham and David Dodd and their 1934 plant standard work "Security Analysis" (German:
Speaking with John Maynard Keynes, supporters of the Contrarian strategy argue that "a fundamental principle of investment is to oppose the prevailing view, because if everyone agrees on the merits of an asset, it is necessarily too expensive and thus unattractive."
For one thing, the increase in risk aversion, given the debt problems in Greece and Spain, would call for a flight to safe assets.
On the other hand, from the point of view of a foreign investor, a plant in Franken would represent a diversification in the portfolio.
Moreover, flows of funds into indexed products hit a relatively illiquid market, forcing investors from passively managed mandates into assets at a yield level that, in our view, is not sustainable.
The real dimension was evident when the Bank's third-quarter earnings were published: The new Basel III rules would have more than doubled the risk-weighted assets (RWA) in investment banking, owing largely to fixed-income assets.
The lack of investment alternatives and the world's high level of liquidity in investors "depots also speaks to a stock asset.
One makes a decision (buys a plant) and hopes for a positive effect (would like to make a return).
It is a mass for the yield fluctuations of a plant around its mean value.
Instruments with very deep risks, such as most money-market assets, receive one, very high-risk assets, such as options, but a five.
This is particularly important given the current very unusual market environment for fixed-income assets, which is characterized by exceptionally low returns and a lack of supply of safe assets.
For investors who want to share the potential of stock markets but are unwilling to bear all the risks involved, a convertible-bond asset is on offer.
Many company founders are also looking for ways to convert some of their corporate-linked assets into cash and diversify into unsecured and uncorrelated assets.
Long-term investments in the oil, mining, manufacturing and transport sectors are more stable than the assets in stocks and bonds currently being withdrawn from other emerging markets.
Responsible facilities offer new opportunities
For example, the first comprehensive investment report from seven regions around the world, the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance (GSIA) in 2013, found that at least $13.6 trillion of professionally managed assets now apply so-called ESG criteria (environmental, social, and governance considerations, environmental, social, and governance criteria) to the selection and management of their assets.
This corresponds to around 22 per cent of managed assets from these regions and proves that sustainable facilities in the regions studied have reached a critical mass overall.
The final panel discussion dealt with the central theme of "impact investing," that is, assets that, in addition to their financial return, also deliver social and / or environmental improvements, thanks to sustainable business growth.
Pointing to the collapse of the Rana factory building in Bangladesh in April 2013, which claimed more than 1100 lives and around 1,000 seriously injured among the seamers employed there, Oliver Niedermaier explained that long-term investors, such as sovereign wealth funds, Ultra High Net Worth Individuals, and precautionary institutions, regard these kinds of assets as particularly attractive:
Responsible investment (RI) or responsible investment is an investment approach that takes into account environmental, social and governance aspects ("environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations") in the choice and management of assets.
We have been able to raise funds quickly, especially for alternative plants, and we now need to industrialise all processes - from marketing to distribution.
Speaking of growth in alternative assets: What is the result of this demand?
In my opinion, the AM, with its first-class products in the field of alternative and traditional assets, as well as its strong multi-asset class solutions business, meets these requirements.
How do you ensure a solid investment and risk management process?
What does this mean with regard to installations?
The new, hand-picked investment topics and ideas from Credit Suisse's Investment Strategy & Research team were developed to help you get the best out of your plant in the second half of 2014.
Giles Keating, head of research, explains the considerations behind the ideas and the impact of the plant.
"For example, European customers like to delegate their assets and often opt for asset management mandates.
The third factor could play a role, although we don't have explicit government guidelines on assets.
Life insurance companies such as pension funds, which have traditionally built heavily on fixed-income assets, face problems.
Given their risk profile, and also because of the investment directives (BVG), it will be difficult for these investors to increase their share of riskier assets, such as equities or high-interest bonds.
This deleveraging means that market participants liquidate their emerging-market assets.
Stock exchanges are now owned by shareholders who expect an adequate return on their assets.
The 2001 boom was triggered by too little real-estate supply, strong employment growth, expansionary monetary policy, and the trend for households to shift their assets from equities to residential real estate.
In addition to traditional direct investment, there are a whole range of alternatives that avoid the potential disadvantages of such an asset, such as low liquidity and a lack of transparency.
Simply put, I decide whether to invest more in bonds, equities, cash, or alternative assets, as well as in allocating various sub-asset categories, such as loans, hedge funds, or private equity, such as regions, countries, and styles, such as substance values (value stocks), or growth values (growth stocks).
He now gives a number of ways to cover the megatrends "demographic developments," "multipolar world" and "sustainability" with a single facility.
That would then be the right environment to deal intensively with plants that take these megatrends into account.
Indeed, the plant has yielded high returns to countries with weaker economic growth in the past.
The primary investment issue for an investment in India is consumption, that is, an investment in non-cyclical consumer goods, body care products, electronic products, high-demand goods such as cars and mobile phones or luxury goods.
For each profile, it is stipulated in which bandwidth the bonds, the shares, the alternative assets and the currencies may move.
American data provide an approximate idea of the potential returns on agricultural land assets.
Plants in farmland would have been a good blend for most depots over the last two decades.
Only the right harvest year makes a noble wine a good plant.
The report also provides valuable data for the important top-down analysis of assets, placing current market concerns about public debt in the right context: It shows that the estimated $42 trillion of global public debt in 2009 equals only one-fifth of the $195 trillion of household wealth worldwide, "explained Giles Keating.
At the same time, they open up interesting opportunities for plants in companies that benefit from this development.
The Danish entrepreneur and venture capitalist Morten Lund learned this for himself when a position of his portfolio of more than 80 assets - the most famous of which was the Internet telephone and video software Skype - became worthless in 2009, bringing him around all the assets.
The development of exclusive offers has led to new structured products, tailor-made assets, and new investment funds, such as a $750 million loan fund.
We can support customers in all areas - from pure wealth creation to the stage in which they need complex solutions to investment and investment issues. "
"Our biggest competition has been passive facilities in recent years," explains Mr Kuffer.
He was involved in two companies and had made some of his assets to money through an IPO of both companies.
"It has already occurred that we are advising an internationally active publicly traded company on mergers and capital markets while at the same time offering personal investment or financial advice to the family holding company," says Fleuriot.
In general, therefore, it is right to argue that, with the right advice and care, hedge-fund assets are not necessarily riskier than traditional assets.
Alternative assets therefore remain an important part of any allocation of capital.
Unlike in the 1990 "s, the minimum interest rate can no longer be achieved with a near-risk-free facility like Swiss federal obligations.
The coupons' investment and repayment amounts of the bonds at higher interest rates, however, offset the market value loss in the long term.
But, in times of negative real interest rates, it cannot be seen as an adequate asset for the medium and long term, because investors must accept a real loss of wealth.
Thus, by expanding the range of products and services in philanthropy, microfinance, sustainable assets, and so-called "impact investing," Swiss banks could open up interesting new business areas.
However, against the backdrop of latent and difficult to predict structural inflationary pressures, we are already increasingly relying on real assets.
Real assets are a cornerstone of our investment strategy.
The cyclical progress, the generous liquidity supply of central banks, the continued favourable or appropriate valuation of riskier assets, and the continuing pressure on investment should continue to push the financial-market pendulum toward opportunities.
In the case of alternative plants, too, the right mix of these heterogeneous plants must be put together.
Unlike the euro or the dollar, risk-free assets in Swiss francs still yield a positive return.
Should the states be offered a menu with just one dish or a meal √† la carte?
Personally, I believe that the invention of food √† la carte compared to the menu with only one dish, which corresponded to the food habits of the barracks, represented a great step forward for civilisation.
"We merely point out how meals that make fat can be replaced by low-calorie yet tasty dishes."
In addition, some dishes are complete meals, while others consist exclusively of vegetables.
The protein / energy ratio recommended for dishes prepared only with meat (7 g per 100 kcal) is above the value of an added beef half (5 g per 100 kcal), but is much lower than that for chicken, poultry and fish (15 g per 100 kcal).
Fruit juices (with or without added sugar), nectar (diluted fruit juice, usually with added sugar) and dishes consisting exclusively of fruit have long been part of the food of the abject infant throughout Europe.
The committee's recommendations allow a slight increase in the natural carbohydrate content (up to a total value of 15 g per 100 ml in fruit and nectar and up to 20 g per 100 g in a dish consisting only of fruit), which should allow the taste to be matched.
Changes in dietary habits were also caused by explosively evolving travel, mobility, the advent of restaurants, among others, that offer foreign dishes, and the growing popularity of foreign food.
Paella The court is from the Spanish rice growing area on the Mediterranean coast, the region of Valencia.
A few days later, when he was brought back to the same court, he used his detector to detect ionizing radiation at that time, something very new and extremely impressive, and found that the food was radioactive.
He gave a little of a radioactive substance into the food leftovers on his plate, and when the same dish was put before him again, he used his radiation detector and found that the food was radioactive.
There are also gluten-free alternatives and dishes for allergy sufferers. "
Consequently, there is a great need for ready meals, which has led to the development of new food products and packaging, such as TV dinners and pre-cooked dishes, which are ready for consumption or only have to be warmed in the microwave.
Examples of products in which these materials are already used are storage pile dishes, snacks such as potato chips and peanuts, and also the ultra-light "cider-shaped" vacuum packaging for coffee.
Within a generation, our food has become more varied and diverse - we eat food and dishes from all over Europe and around the world.
In each school, the most successful dishes were awarded, and these recipes were published in the journal Ha Kuriren.
She learned how to prepare Italian dishes and, in particular, desserts with fresh ingredients from the surrounding area.
If you like to travel in this way, however, you have to find these wonderful places, be sure to get a good reception there and try authentic regional dishes.
Guests enjoyed traditional Finnish dishes based on reindeer, salmon and caviar, including Finnish beers.
At this event, organised under the auspices of the President and the Secretary-General of the EESC and in cooperation with Herv√© COUPEAU (Group III - Various Interests), representatives of the young farmers of France and the overseas French departments in committee, typical products and culinary specialities from Martinique, Guadeloupe, R√©union, Guayana and Corsica were presented and traditional dishes and drinks were provided.
If you add a little flexibility and freedom so that a group can exchange dishes with each other, you may even achieve an even greater degree of satisfaction.
Max crowd works as a volunteer
They work equally in several places in their volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Crowd: Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I've already worked in the open full day at the school.
What are your experiences with it?
Crowd: It's a nice, wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
They are now 26 years, so a late-working volunteer.
How is that coming?
Crowd: I graduated from high school.
And then a civil engineering degree, let's say, successfully aborted.
I've realised for myself that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else, work with people.
And then I wondered what are you doing.
Make a social year, there's a glimpse, as you can see how it is on the ground, in the focal point maybe, really.
And was it?
Crowd: I collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in social affairs in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably do social worker training in the Jugendamt Herne and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Isn't it something unusual to have several different uses during the voluntary service?
Crowd: Yes, it's very variable.
It probably always comes down to where you make your FSJ.
You can do it from the age home to youth work - in all sorts of facets of social work.
With me it was very varied.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly the right thing that mattered to me.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out.
Unlike in civil engineering studies?
Crowd: Well, this is not about counting out statics.
You always have other people in front of your head who each have a very different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, whether a teenager who has been brought out of the family - you always have to address it individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no touch?
Crowd: I'm not the guy for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are negative moments, too, but that's how life is just.
But planning the invasion of Iraq, in which Rumsfeld advocated the use of fewer troops than proposed, suggests an inadequate understanding of distributed systems.
Those who wanted to limit the use of juries apparently feared, in some cases, a risk to state security.
Nearly $3 billion fell in the budget for various compensation for victims of communism and crime, or for expenses for court disputes, even for building savings.
Local authorities were unable to confirm the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
The two first victims were seriously admitted to the hospital, where the eighteen-year-old died.
The lawyer for Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded the lifting of the criminal proceedings once again.
Werner S√∂llner, as far as you can tell, is not only a perpetrator, but also a victim.
The troops are being amassed with praise for their victims.
Mario Monti, the future Italian leader, has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that calls for "sacrifices" to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last few months of Berlusconi's government.
If France were to decide to phase out nuclear power, a large proportion of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and the annual ‚Ç¨6 billion in capital goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more.
As far as my group is concerned, it is particularly positive to see that the development initiated by this House's rejection of the budget has now led to the beginning of a resolution of the problems.
But time and again there are forces that lead to a resolution in the shield, although EuroPilot, the organisation of European pilots, also says that Eurocontrol is the solution to European air traffic control.
The resolution of the Committee on Transport draws attention to the urgent case of Eurocontrol and calls for its dissolution to be avoided, or at least for its specific, albeit limited, functioning to be maintained.
How did the Commission assess the recent dissolution of the political parties in Turkey by the military junta?
Europe is changing under our eyes, but, it should be stressed, with the result of the dissolution and destruction not only of the area, but also of the family, culture and society: This is the Europe of the indifferent, not the Europe of the peoples.
Further proliferation of nuclear weapons as a result of the dissolution of the former Soviet Union must, I believe, be prevented.
The question that arises, however, is whether separation and dissolution will put an end to the disputes, or whether they will continue in the face of the new geopolitical links that are now emerging, which are unlikely to allow peaceful life in the Balkans.
The dangers of the spread of technology and technical know-how for the production of weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, chemical, biological) have increased significantly following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
Their desperation is the result of the dissolution of Yugoslavia and the failure of the leaders to agree on how the peoples of the former Yugoslavia should live together.
It is also nefarious when it says that, following the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, other institutions could be dissolved.
You are basically asking the Community the question: Deepening the federal state or unraveling into a free trade area?
Unfortunately, however, the developments so far following the overthrow of the socialist camp and the dissolution of the USSR, the statements by the representatives of NATO and America, the blatant attacks or interventions against independent states demonstrate the importance of the nature and objectives of any conversion of the arms industry and the conversion of military sites.
But this is no wonder: No country on earth, not even the richest and most developed Western country, could have withstood a sudden 85% decline in its own trade, as happened in Cuba with the dissolution of COMECON.
His dissolution of Parliament, dismissal of the judges and provisional repeal of the constitution, his imprisonment of a large number of people and, of course, his ban on the free press - much of this is not only questionable when it comes to a democracy, but directly illegal.
B3 - 002 / 94 - 0 - 278 / 93) by Mr Moran L√≥pez and others to the Commission on the dissolution of the Gibraltar Social Insurance Fund.
There is no question that the dissolution of a number of African states, including Somalia, Liberia and Burundi, mentioned the Hen Pons Grau in his report, together with the social and economic destabilisation that led to civil wars, played a crucial role in increasing the number of refugees.
Firstly, because we must not confuse the 'integration' of the Member States into the Community or the Union with their 'dissolution' in the same way.
Perhaps things could have taken a different course from the beginning, from the hasty dissolution of Yugoslavia; many sides, including the European Community, are partly responsible for the present situation - secession, war, ethnic cleansing, national homogenisation, intolerance, territorial conquest, obvious incompatibility, violence, cruelty, enmities that will continue for a long time.
After the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, these countries seek the path to democracy and a social market economy.
The political events following this signing, in particular the dissolution of the Kazakh Parliament by President Nazarbaiev, led our Parliament to suspend the ratification procedure for this agreement until parliamentary elections were held.
There are disturbing reports of experiments carried out on people in Ukraine after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
Strengthening Europe is not possible through its disintegration.
These include an immediate dissolution of the military and civilian repression apparatus, the prosecution of the paramilitaries, an end to impunity and compensation for the victims.
The Commission takes on board the conclusions of the Vienna Summit, which provide for the disarmament and dissolution of these militias and the deployment of a United Nations mission to reduce tensions.
I would like to emphasise one thing in this debate: Today we are witnessing the dissolution and destruction of Kosovo and of an entire people.

- the EU recognised the new states resulting from the dissolution of the Soviet Union (the Baltic States in September 1991), Yugoslavia (Slovenia and Croatia in January 1992, Bosnia-Herzegovina in April 1992 and Macedonia in 1995) and Czechoslovakia (the Czech Republic and Slovakia in January 1993);
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, it reestablished its relations with the parliaments of the new countries and formed four separate delegations: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, the three Transcaucasian republics and the Central Asian republics (including Mongolia).

The maintenance and consolidation of parliamentary democracy was therefore always the fundamental theme of the work of the EZPWD in the 1980s, which increased in importance after the disintegration of the communist regimes and the dissolution of the Eastern bloc in 1989 (meeting of correspondents in London, 1989).
With the demise of the communist regimes and the dissolution of the Central and Eastern European Bloch since 1989, parliamentary democracy in Europe has entered a new Ara.

Dissolution; termination of a company that precedes or follows the liquidation of the company, i.e. divestment of the company's assets, satisfaction of the creditors and distribution of the remaining assets among the shareholders.
The subject of this analysis is the relocation of the - as the task states - "seat" of a non-resolution unit.
The addition of 'without dissolution' makes it clear that these are the rules of private international law which determine which law is relevant to a society and whether a society should be regarded as a legally founded legal person.
This study is limited to the question of whether the rules of the Member States in the field of company law and private international law should be harmonised in such a way as to enable companies to move their actual headquarters to another Member State without dissolution.
(1) the law governing a society; (2) the amendment of the law governing a society; (3) the possibility of moving the administrative seat of a society without dissolution from the founding state; (4) the possibility of relocating the administrative seat while retaining the legal personality of society to another Member State.
This requires the disintegration of society in the state of departure and the re-establishment of the host state.
However, jurisprudence does not allow all Member States that apply the theory of seats to allow one society to take its administrative seat without dissolution to another
In some Member States, this would lead to the disintegration of society, in
In all Member States, a company can relocate the administrative seat within the jurisdiction of the state concerned without dissolution.
(1) Companies should be able to move their administrative seat, i.e. their actual seat, to another Member State without dissolution.
(2) Companies are entitled, due to freedom of establishment, to relocate their actual seat without dissolution (subject to the rules that apply in the Member States for reasons of traffic protection).
This represents a step backwards for those Member States that apply the theory of seats and allow the relocation of seats without dissolution.
It is only on the basis of proof of the disintegration of society that the state of departure can delete these registers in accordance with the legislation of a Member State which is relevant to society.

Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it will cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 per cent as another restructuring programme is launched to overcome the pressure the company is facing.
The job cuts, which Director General John Fallon announced largely for late 2018 and early 2019, come in addition to his previous restructuring, which has already lost 4,000 jobs.
Pearson announced in a third cost-cutting program in May a plan to cut costs by another ¬£300 million ($394 million) to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it achieved an increase of 1 per cent to ¬£2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and injuring several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a statement from Nato said.
Unconfirmed local reports say three civilians also died in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest violence to hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed at a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
In a statement from Nato, it says the explosion on Thursday night happened when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an "improvised explosive device worn by people."
The statement says all the injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. Military Hospital at Bagram airport.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, including about 20% in the capital.
In late July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out that attack.
On May 31, a huge bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's deadliest militant attack since US-led forces pushed the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as U.S. President Donald Trump is weighing in to increase the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The US Environmental Protection Agency has repealed a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration that requires states to curb smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency for the move.
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so-called "ozone regulations in 2015," and said it showed the agency's commitment to working with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners," EPA chief executive Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June the EPA's intention to delay ozone regulations - which aim to measure pollutant emissions in one part of the country to determine where cuts need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards - by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 largely democratic states, along with the District of Colombia, filed suit on Tuesday, saying that the effort was illegal.

However, the efforts have triggered the setback of Democrats and conservation groups, who are worried about the impact of larger emissions on public health.
The EPA's website says that inhaling air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase breathing symptoms" such as asthma.

While it will take time for the parish-owned area to be in municipal ownership, there is now no longer any impediment to planning for the project to be undertaken by a private investor.
For this there is a discussion about a Community area.
One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, he would provide a living space - around 55 square feet - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square feet of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the local council intend not to provide such a community area as a meeting point only for residents of seniority housing, but openly into the community.
As an example, the word from the "knitting cafe" made the turn.
The decision, which was taken by allocating funds to the current budget as early as last autumn, is sweetened by funding opportunities.
Construction is in the refurbishment area.
Setting up a community space, Tjaden reported, would be eligible with 60 per cent of 30 per cent.
The proposal for a decision, in order to signal to the investor that they do not want to throw a stick between their feet in this respect, provides for the conclusion that both saddle - which is linked to the construction of the environment - and pulpit roof - which reduces the amount of traffic and makes construction more economical - would be possible.

Walking in resin from star to star
In resin, the nationwide first "stellar trail" is expected to emerge.
This is planned by the association observatory Saint Andreasberg.
There is a planetary route in G√∂ttingen - since 2003.
A "stellar trail" meets the information needs of many resin visitors, it said.
It combines nature, science, movement and sporting performance.
Members want to set up panels along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations.
In a first phase by 2018, the club plans "well-achievable installations at five to six locations" in the upper resin.
Eligible would be St Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegei√ü and Sieber.
The information on the panels is to be supplemented by the Internet.
That is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in location selection.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the stellar trail train is to be expanded by train.
"On the stellar trail, viewers experience a lot of knowledge, for example, about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
They also learned why stars have different colors, or why one star shines more than another, though it is much further away.
It also conveys in what constellation is a selected star and when he is best seen.
The association has already operated since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg, the highest located observatory in northern Germany.

In the university city, since 2003, on the initiative of the Planetarium G√∂ttingen conveyor association, there is something similar to the planned stellar value - the planetary path.
Starting in front of Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its stings leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "alien" location in Diemarden (municipality equals) with the planet Sedna.
The stings with the individual planets - including the dwarf planet degraded Pluto at the end point - are situated exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth thus shrinks to a bullet of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the exact 75 meters away sun measures 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planetary path is well over four kilometres.
While the light from sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to stele with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in space.

Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko must contend with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also has an interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight at the Forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans asked about him," Garcia said, and later pressed openly to fight at the network offering the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready... "
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter," and he may take part in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks the three-game champion from Riverside looks "very slow, I'm sorry Mikey... you want the co-off."
Garcia said the focus was to show batting strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum building up for their own fight.
"This is the fight that needs to be carried out.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it, "Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight. ""
Four injured after tyre burst
In an accident on the A7, four people were partially seriously injured on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at around 4.30pm just before the junction market wide is believed to be after a tyre burst.
The passenger dragged to the right into the embankment, where he fell asleep and then left on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were partly seriously injured in the accident.
During the initial care of the injured by the ambulance service, the A7 was closed heading north for about an hour, then traffic on the left lane at the site could be passed.
This is also good advice on land, but it is all the more important under water because of the poor light conditions.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three-chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann, after going 2-2 at the start of the season against Braunschweig, hopes that tweaking the defensive formation in Aue brings points.
With the first game of the season, Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result, too, would not have been the two opposition at 2-2 against Braunschweig.
"These were two opponents too much, and we have to be even better careful in Aue," says Fortuna D√ºsseldorf's defenseman.
In the ArchMountains, the three chain should also be further optimized.
And a goal after a free-kick don't want to capture the Fortunes either.
"For the future, it will be the case that no one is standing next to Michael (Rensing) on the line."
Hoffmann is convinced that even after the experience in preparing with the three-chain, his team will cope better than with the quadriceps.
"Still I don't know how we're going to operate in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause "because we just have players in the three-way chain on the half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gie√üelmann who can build well," Hoffmann said.
"The prerequisite is, but that we harmonize even better and we don't afford so many play errors in the build-up."
Of course, Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game.
'but whether you can speak of a failed start after a draw doesn't know.
The performance could well be okay, "Hoffmann remarked.
"But if we can stand with four points on Sunday and focus on the trophy, we will certainly be able to talk about a proper start to the season."
His coach didn't want to know anything about it.
"The start of the season I'm only judging after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm funkel, who doesn't want to speak of an advantage over Aue just because the Saxony's game in Heidenheim had to be aborted early because of a storm.
"Now they can virtually start the season with a home game," funkel said and Hoffmann believes the players from Aue might even be a little fresher, as they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an uphill favorite in the bone.
"But they don't know as 100% where they currently stand," says the Fortuna's interior designer.
While guests from the Rhineland go as a slight favourite on Sunday in the encounter at the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"The fact that we are sweeping them away just because we have the claim to get under the first six is nonsense," says funkel, whose record is quite positive in just one defeat to Aue from nine games.
"There's no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the outset," explains Fortuna's head coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And so Funkel definitely doesn't want to experience his players on Sunday.

On the day the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the politically divisive question of whether to listen to a challenge to President Obama's health laws, two of his justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by the firm that will represent the case in court.

Bray testified that the response of the "empires" to the eviction of their tent camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came down to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the violent eviction of the square and allowing the protesters the tents.

New results of Swedish asylum age assessment tests published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical evaluation of their age, show that more than 80% of those tested are over the age of 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Authority for Forensic Medicine (puzzlemedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests last year.
They are expected to make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum process, after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migration verket) was criticised for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, Migration verket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years old."
The tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is called into question.
According to Johan G√∂ransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months.
"We don't see a big difference in the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are pretty consistent," he told the journal The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that "suggest that the person investigated is 18 years or older."
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of those cases, the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, where X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRT recordings are made by knee joints, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
One skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing people's biological maturity to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
'i had reason to think about it and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
Judging the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure, we shouldn't pretend we could, "he told newspaper Metro.
However, G√∂ransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of judging a child incorrectly as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent. "

Full in the plan
Work on the three bridges of Highway 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven tonne concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We're very good at the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Road and Transport at Freiburg County Court.
In April, work began simultaneously on all three gentrifying bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The end of construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to be sure that the timetable will be met.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a vault bow bridge made of concrete, which is dressed with red bobblestone and has a total length of 4.80 metres.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.
To ensure steadfastness and road safety, the three structures will now be thoroughly refurbished.
The other two bridges run over the Lauterbach.
They are built from red Buntsandstein.
Both were built in 1939 and are 12, or 10.60 feet long.
The bridge at the local entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 metre wide and seven tonne so-called bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning.
This is a peripheral fastening, which is also used as an operating route.
On the southern part of the bridge, a 2.20 metre wide bridge cap is expected to be used on Friday.
Then there is the pedestrian route.
The particular thing is that these are finished parts, a patent from the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with patented bridge caps.
Particular sensitivity has required the laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a fibre optic cable, to which many companies are connected.
Local residents were informed of the project in the run-up to the work through handpapers.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the Bauhofhaus building and the Sammelweiher in the direction of Schramberg, the traffic is regulated by a traffic light.
For construction work on the bridge at Lauterbacher local entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is fully closed.
The combined cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000.
The whole thing is funded by the country.

AFD in Gerolstein: Baffled protest at German potato
It is not so common for parties to pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to reconcile.
The parties represented in the Vulkaneifel Circle (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, left) belong to a broad alliance that peacefully flags that day, because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites to the "big campaign launch," according to the poster.
And familiar names at the launch - like Alice Weidel, who, along with Alexander Gauland, forms the top duo for the general election on September 24, and Deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are on the ground hours before the start of the event don't want to listen to the AfD-ers, but demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful."
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at a Table" in Fountain Square, but now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondells - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
A colourful picture that features there.
And what Christa Karoli, chair of the Forum A World and one of the authoritative organizers, is really looking forward to: "Great how many people have come together here."
There is music and plenty of food, including a "great-German potato that even the AfD could easily eat," says the woman who brought him.
Police have ordered many officers to Gerolstein, saying it shows presence especially at the station, which is just a few metres from the venues.
How did the AfD actually get on Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reports he was seeking such an event and got the bid.
The 45-year-old from G√∂nnersdorf had initially asked in Daun but received a cancellation there because because of the already built-up Laurentiuskirmes, there were not enough parking spaces available.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is delighted that "we can have such a beautiful event here."
Looking at the event on Rondellvorplatz, he says: "This is the good right of the people, the main thing is, it remains peaceful."
It does: At about 8pm, on Rondellvorplatz, a band provides entertainment, in which city hall various speakers, including the Rhineland-plucky AfD chairman Uwe Young.
In the room are about 200 listeners waiting for the front-runner for the general election, Alice Weidel, and Deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix von Storch to give their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far officers have had a quiet evening.
A little more than an hour takes the AfD event, guests on the front seat have a longer breath, but even there is scheduled to clean up shortly after 9pm.
Police can move off - no special incidents.

Trombone hits trumpet
A rehearing with the Wolves trombonist Frederic Belli is available in the series of Haslach monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 8pm at the monastery church.
Together with Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest," or just "Balkan folklore" meets a classic German education with roots in blowout music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
So is Petkov Solotrompeter at the prestigious Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is soloposaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of different genres.
So Johann Sebastian Bach sounds at the two as in a new guise, Daniel Schnyder's "world music" reunites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the play "Exchange Suite" by the jazz echopreist Nils Wogram, mixing classical, jazz and free play into a fascinating overall artwork.

Arguably the Hollywood star's best-known relationship was the one to her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who ultimately went bitterly apart.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures The Harper's Bazaar magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I've been dating.
Or do you think I would have played it? '
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I've always lived dualism and seriously believed in it.
So it has never confused or hindered me.
I just never liked not being taken serious.'
She suffered particularly from this, according to "Bang Showbiz" but in school time, when she preferred to dress like a lad: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me very much.
When I was 11 the kids told me I would look like a lad.
I felt really attacked, terrified and embarrassed.
Now I look back and think to myself, 'Girl, be proud of you!'. "
Particularly to the public, she doesn't like to explain her love life: "People expect you to match yourself in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some describe me as undeterred, but I don't like having to justify myself to the whole public.'
The governor of West Virginia announces that he is changing the party
. West Virginia's Democratic governor, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he will change the party.
Whether you like it or not, Democrats have moved away from me, "Governor Justice said.
"Today I'll tell you with a lot of prayers and a lot of reflection... today I'll tell you as a resident of West Virginia I can't help you any more if I'm a Democratic governor." "
The rally erupted in cheers.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would say that it's time to play another game." "

Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night in which it said, "Governor Justice's party change is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us rather than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governors and the control of the least legislative entities in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is without leadership from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel told CBS News in a statement.

Coe praises' honest 'Russian apology for doping scandal
The world's head of athletics, Sebastian Coe, on Thursday praised what he described as an apparent apology from Russia to a doping scandal, but he reiterated it was not the moment for the country to be reinstated in the sport.
Russia's athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF congress on the eve of the athletics world championships that his country's banishment from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were taken away in competitions of gold and silver medals."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to uphold the ban, which was imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the task force's recommendations that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia," Coe said.
"We must do everything in the next few months to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the spoiled system, "he added
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the athletics world championships, which begin in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.

Funeral act for soldiers stabbed in Mali
At a funeral service in northeastern Fritzlar, about 1,000 people of the two were thought to have died in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security arrangements.
On the still unsolved crash cause, Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
However, she described the two killed pilots as "the skill of their specialist."
"We bow to this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old major and 47-year-old chief of staff from North Hessen were killed in West African Mali on Wednesday.
Her coffins were transferred to Germany and taken on Thursday accompanied by a death guard of the federal government in the Fritzlarer Dom St Peter.
At midday, at first, only the relatives in the church took leave.
After that, the funeral service began in the circle of the family, closest friends, from representatives of the federal government as well as politics.
Among them were Hessens Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the inspector general of the Federal Armed Forces Volker Wieker.
Mourners laid down roses, and relatives stood arm in arm at the coffins.
Outside the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers watched the ceremony on a canvas.
Defence Minister von der Leyen described the killed soldiers as "highly decorated" and deployed.
The staff chief co-built the flight operation of the fighter helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment, which includes the soldiers, also explained: "If this crew could not avert the crash, then no one would have been able to."
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister von der Leyen: The deployment was dangerous.
But he is also of high importance "for a country from which we are separated only by two states," she said.
After the funeral ceremony, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they will be buried, the federal government did not provide details.
According to Credit Suisse's Fair Value model, the Swiss franc to the euro remains undervalued, even though it has appreciated from a franc-euro rate of more than 1.60 to around 1.50 since 2007.
Advanced-country stock markets are valued at a price-earnings ratio of 17 versus a KGV of ten for emerging stock markets.
Value investors focus on the "price" in the price-earnings ratio, while growth investors are more interested in the "profit" element of this metric.
Thus, Contrarian investors choose firms that are undervalued and have negative price momentum.
Finally, the Euro-franc course remains an issue:
The stronger and more often, for example, the price of a stock oscillates, the greater the fluctuation width and the riskier the capital investment is.
"The Swiss National Bank's decision to set the course at 1.20 was crucial to ensuring that growth could revive quickly," Melli recalls.
If you look at the price of gold over a longer period of time, you have to say that the yellow metal is not exactly cheap at its current rate.

In 2010, Geithner still attracted the attention of the media and Chinese authorities when he complained at the WEF about the yuan's course.
If a rapid appreciation of China's currency is potentially dangerous to the global economy, why is the White House so fixated on the yuan's exchange rate?
"Even though the price / earnings ratio is currently moving in the area of the values recorded in 2007, we do not expect a significant correction at the moment.
Macroeconomic aspects and corporate profits will not be among the main driving factors, which is why we expect the price / earnings ratio to expand in 2013.
Shirakawa forecasts inflation of just 0.6% in 2014, well below the BoJ's 2% target, and could cause the central bank to weaken the yen's exchange rate even further to achieve its inflation target.
The highest returns appear to be achieved when dividend yields are high and the price-earnings ratio (KGV) is low.
Higher return on equity, higher price-book value ratio and higher pay-out ratio, "according to Stefano Natella, head of Global Equity Research in Credit Suisse's Investment Banking division.
There are higher price-book value ratios.
The PEG ratios (price-earnings ratio divided by profit growth) of most large and almost all medium-size enterprises are still fairly favorable compared to other emerging economies.
As France strengthened, the dollar's value fell from about 4.30 francs to a little more than 2 francs within a few years.
Moreover, valuations of future price-earnings ratios seem attractive, as most companies "shares are listed at the bottom of their historical price range.
Finally, the costs for local companies are rising less than those for their competitors abroad, while the exchange relationship with the euro remains constant at a rate of around 1.20 francs.
The basic idea behind convertible bonds is that they will be converted into shares if the company's price drops below a certain value.
When the franc-euro rate was at 1.60, that has dropped much bigger margins than now, where the course is at 1.22.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all assets from its portfolio where money is used for betting on food prices," Bode said.
So just 11% consider it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer assets that bet on food prices.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such deals: One in two, according to the survey, would cancel all assets where money goes into commodity speculation.

About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Jim√©nez believed that micro-credit was a "serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty," and that developed-country governments must now "work more than ever" according to solidarity criteria, and should not allow solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
However, he reluctantly admitted that the strange severity under which he suffers could be attributed to a more natural, somewhat more tangible cause - the serious and protracted illness - indeed, the apparently near dissolution - of a tenacious sister - the only companion of long years - of the last and only relatives on earth.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The man of Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried alongside his wife after his death.
The royal house said on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is joined in the Cathedral Church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bj√∏rn N√∏rgaard already produced a sarcophagus for the two.
The queen agrees with her husband's decision, the statement said.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried is still unclear.
But he has no intention of being joined in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of the fact that he wasn't happy with his title.
After the thrashing of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016, he retired while also laying the title "Prinzgemahl."
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he does not see himself as equal to his wife - even after death, explained Lene Balleby, the Danish royal's chief spokeswoman.
Where the 83-year-old's final resting place will ultimately be is still unclear.
But he did not intend to be joined in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years.
The native Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble sex, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
On the Thames he worked in the French Embassy.
While his later wife always floated the people's expressions of sympathy, Prince Henrik had a serious stand in his almost 50-year reign at the Danes.
In an autobiography, Henrik commented about the first few years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticised.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitting socks, Citro√´n instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises I smoked instead of Virginia-based tobacco and who had a reputation here for being the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I couldn't hope for leniency.
I was different.
I seemed to be happy with that position and not to be ashamed.
These were two mistakes! "

Prime Minister Weil wants swift reelection
CDU and FBI facing possible majority in Lower Saxony
Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a swift reelection of the country after losing the red-carpet government majority, but he does not want to resign.
Because spoke in favour of the dissolution of Parliament on Friday.
Earlier, the surprise exit of a Greens MP from their county faction in Lower Saxony plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the state election, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and the FBI.
The previous Greens MP, Elke Twesten, justified her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Desmme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she declared in Hanover on Friday.
CDU leader Bj√∂rn Th√ºmler wants to recommend his group to include them.

The new country day will be elected regular on January 14 next year.
Th√ºmler said the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to govern in this situation without a majority.
Stephan Weil believes, however, that it is essential for the country to decide on its self-dissolution as soon as possible.
The CDU group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The national constitution also provides for the possibility that the county day will deprive the prime minister of confidence and elect a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These opportunities need to be tested legally clean, "Th√ºmler said.
"One will calmly discuss all issues if they are legally properly considered."
Th√ºmler called Twesten's move "but somewhat curious."
The politician herself insisted: "I'm not a traitor.

"We assume, of course, that she returns her county mandate, which she has received through the green national list, with immediate effect," the country's chairmen Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Korner told reporters.
Greens leader Anja Piel said: "We deeply regret Elke Twesten's decision."
She deliberately chose not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even against the background that there were no substantive differences, we cannot understand this step."
Obama chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of lower-ranking Greens MP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of former Greens MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of voters, but also betrayal of reds," the Social Democrats' federal leader wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil's (SPD) decision to allow the country to revote quickly.
Leaving Twestens costs Red Green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician puts "in her wounded vanity and in her frustration her personal interests ahead of the welfare of the country," SPD Secretary Hubertus Heil criticized.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is involved in this dirty intrigue game and is trying to capitalize on it politically."
Dutch CDU leader Bj√∂rn Th√ºmler wants to advise his MPs to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The SPD's leader in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of falsifying the outcome of the 2013 election with personal career moves.
The CDU was strongest before the SPD at the time, but SPD and Green had a razor-thin majority of one vote in the county day.

Agriculture Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison ponds, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves.
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in the interview with the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp imprint.
On the consumer protection portal www.grocery warning, the federal states provide the latest information on the affected egg batches.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we know at the moment, a health hazard is virtually excluded.
Is Aldi now taking on the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the reconnaissance is not really perceived by the federal agriculture minister?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my House has moved on without delay and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since it was announced that Germany was concerned.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade, like manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are viable and safe for health.
If, for eggs, the maximum residue content of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded, they are not viable.
However, uncontaminated eggs can be sold and eaten.
This time, businesses are not to blame.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, production companies are not directly to blame.
Instead, they face economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there are too few inspectors in the worst case.
Is there only a lack of staff or a lack of coherent competence?
It was precisely the official controls that uncovered the process.
But the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100% excluded.
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent investigation of such events and the handover to public prosecutors in cases where crimes can be committed are of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to provide complete information.
Is regular alertness in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and accessible food.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The panicked funds have put manufacturers, traders and consumers in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide fipronil in the keeping of food-supplying animals is unacceptable and must be ended immediately.
This must be worked on consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the situation quickly and fully.
How football's financial rules affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded spending by European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar's world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, as the senior organisation that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean PSG will eventually have to prove that Neymar's transfer was funded without big losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several $10 million a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money loose for Neymar to underwrite and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding by Qatar's energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on acquiring players, but must counter with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them to break-Even point in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken on huge debts in their quest for success were effectively cheating and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on the clubs "debt to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher issue.
During the current three-year FFP predisposition period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of ¬£30 million.
And, though Platini fell in disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, remains committed to discouraging excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future," Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid Neymar's buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so the clearance rate for the next five years can be reported at $44.4 million in the annual accounts.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit PSG along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.
PSG received a fine of $60 million (then $82 million), which was later lowered to $20 million - and it was ordered that team members remain limited to 21 players for the 2014 / 15 Champions League season instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlist their financial supervision by inflating their revenue through companies linked to a club's owners.
While a Catalan company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship were to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not let this be considered a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of the PSA's sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come via payments from the organising committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar in 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassador and that such a maneuver could be easy for UEFA regulators to find out.
Previous sanctions against PSG mean UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, sagging on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.
They spoke on condition of anonymity with The Associated Press as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG achieved a profit of more than ¬£10 million in 2015 / 16 with sales of ¬£542.4 million.
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be released.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club estimates that sales will rise by at least 30 per cent after signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go, and it tried to prevent Neymar's walkout by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It's a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," the president of La Liga, Javier Tebas, told Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's eventual ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state funding a club.
"It's the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once a country owns a club, anything is possible.
It's going to be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country.'
Calmly, the Turkish community of Germany responded: It recalled at the weekend with a memorial service outside the Brandenburg Gate to the victims of racist violence.
The urban tender on the 16 goals reopens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
No doubt a gate points to the concept of a park.
Either that is the case, or someone is planning to put goals on the land.
Collserola is more complex, "says the architect, for whom the title" Gates of Collserola "carries a" lexical trap ": Imagine it not" as an entrance to a park, but as a containment of areas where action must be taken. "
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodr√≠guez, lamented "the success," "marginalized" people "who always face closed doors" to give "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Le√≥n de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opened its doors, plugged by the spirit of solidarity."
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
Swiss is looking for a new shock supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has produced on-board chocolate for the Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is facing a possible end: The airline is rewriting the order.
Swiss-based spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed at the request of the news agency sda a corresponding report from the newspaper "Northwest Switzerland" Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"With current supplier Chocolat Frey, we are very satisfied," the spokeswoman said.
About 17 million small red-white packaged shock panels to 14 grams distribute to flight attendants each year before landing to passengers.
About the costs, the Swiss did not want to provide details.
Industry insiders estimate the volume of orders according to "Northwest Switzerland" at 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves annual sales of around one billion francs.
But what's more important is the advertising effect: For a shock manufacturer, it's a prestigious assignment.
As many applicants there are in the new tender, the Swiss does not want to reveal.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to seek a renewal of the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate maker was not available for comment.
Chocolate panels have been distributed by the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights.
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebau had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
The possibility of placing the logo introduced Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers are pampered with treats from the Confiserie Spthirgli, in business class nav passengers Schoggi from Lindt and in Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey.
Also on the short track, Swiss Schoggi is distributed by Chocolat Frey, both in business and economy class.
However, energy policy cannot be assessed solely from an environmental point of view, since not a single power station - whatever kind - would soon be set up and, for example, stone, clay and earth processing and all chemical industries would have to be examined for the acceptance conditions of their waste among the population and, to quote Mrs Weber once again, they would probably have to wait very long, if not in vain, for acceptance.
As raw materials for their production, metals, cardboard and plastics are now used apart from clay and glass.
This should be done in the best possible tone.
And the best tone is under the House of Commons.
I have not yet heard a Conservative say that we should store the waste in the best tone under the Thames.
The area is urbanized (10% of the area is built); the light to heavy soil (sand, clay, clay) is mostly suitable for land management (41% is farmland), forest hardly meets (8.2%).
Clay, cement, lime, plaster, asbestos products, processed natural stones, grinding stones and other grinding agents, glass and ceramic products.
This also includes so-called monocarbine seeds, which are produced by breeding, and precision seeds produced by the artificial division of the sperm dumplings (genetically ingrained or imitated in a technical way), even if it is accompanied by an excess (mostly on the basis of sound).
Here belong objects made from iron and limestone clay (brick earth) with matt, earth-colored fracture (generally brown, red or yellow).
Stones AND ERDEN AND building materials sand, gravel, bims, clay, slumps; salt, sulphur kies, sulphur; other stones, earth and related raw minerals; cement, lime; plaster, other edited building materials.
This also includes so-called monogermsaalgut, which is produced by breeding, and precision seeds obtained by artificially dividing the sperm dumplings (genetically ingrained or imitated in a technical way), even if it has an excess (mostly on the basis of sound).
According to PRINZ / 15 / binary soil types always consist of a mixture of clay and loopholes with very different proportions of large grain fractions.
Under the same climatic conditions, the content of organic substances is higher in tone than in sip or clay.
In particular, clay, but also clay, are fitted as natural materials in layers with predominantly static compression at the landfill base.
The sealing of landfills with such clay-sand mixtures is extremely economical and well controllable.
The secondary natural material (clay) sealing layer of variant 2 consists exclusively of natural materials.
This base layer is more likely to be made from downstream natural materials (usually clay) than from upcoming insitu condensed soils.
To calculate the power of the natural material (clay) layer, some procedures are offered by the EPO.
In the new draft directive, it is pointed out that, for this variant of the system, the existing legal requirements (60 cm of condensed clay with a k _ value of 1 to 109 m / s) are no longer sufficient.
In the narrow conversion process, according to the respective geological conditions, the compression of the base is achieved either by filling or squeezing sealing masses (clay cement and Bentonite cement mixtures).
The gradient i of the wall range is calculated from the water mirror difference and the thickness of the sealing wall, while the gradient i is determined for the sealing horizon (tone, sip) from the water mirror difference and the insertion depth of the trough wall.
The tone acts as a semi-permeable membrane.
However, the animon exchange capacity is increased by the organic substance kerogen, which can be finely distributed in tone up to 2 gew.-%.
Assessment of the lithological composition of the geological formation (in particular distinction between clay and sand)
Here belong objects made from iron and limestone clay (brick earth) with matt, earth-colored fracture (generally brown, red or yellow).
The R & D program for the in situ qualification of the concept of final storage in deep sound formations has continued.
The materials are to be examined in these laboratories as well as locally in clay, granite and salt formations.
Gravel, stones, sand and clay Kali and natural phosphates stone salt, sea salt other minerals, peat bricks and pottery products cement, lime, plaster construction materials made of concrete, cement or plaster asbestos products (except products made from asbestos cement) natural stones and other non-metallic mineral products grinding discs and other grinding glass (flax, glass, glass)
Foini's potters still form their vases after lateral anthropomorphic shapes of clay.
The European coastal space ¬°st is very long and consists mostly of sand, clay or chalk, i.e. soft, easily erodible materials.
The research was applied to the simulation of the following problems of practical interest: ‚Ä¢ BACCHUS 2 Test, performed in SCK / CEN in Belgium: Research of condensed, expansive tone for use as a technical barrier in reference
These early characters on clay or stone were the first precursors of sophisticated linguistic tools, the development of which has not yet been completed.
The sound is first fitted with a glass layer and then sintered in the fire at temperatures up to 1160 ¬∞ C so that it reaches the desired mechanical strength and hardness.
Since 1965, the German company Eisenh√ºtte Westfalia-L√ºnen has been building small propulsion machines of the type mole, fox and roof, which are mainly used in soft rock (clay, plaster, pyrite).
100 g of earth (fertile, non-sterile earth) are suspended in 1 000 ml of chlorine-free drinking water (soil species with very high levels of clay, sand and organic carbon are unsuitable).
The results of the studies carried out under the PAGIS project were published in a five-volume edition: A short version (EUR 11775EN), sound (EUR 11776EN), granite (EUR 11777FR), salt (EUR 11778EN) and undersea sediments (EUR 11779EN).
The tone, this formable material that our ancestors used for a variety of purposes, and which is now used in areas as diverse as construction or the pharmaceutical industry, has attracted the attention of scientists and technicians, through its physical and chemical characteristics, who have the task of developing a safe and reliable system for the disposal of nuclear waste by digging in deep layers of rock.
The haughty chemical component of the tone is an aluminium silicate, which is fireproof material, so the tone is not a good heat conductor.
Figure 3: Sound and sound shooting information in the countries of the Community, which would be suitable for the final storage of highly radioactive waste (1980) and some sites of current in-situ exploration of clay stones.
The target formation, the so-called boom tone, is found underground of the site and has a power of more than 100 m. It reaches so deep that a camp could be set up at a depth of over 200 m below the surface.
The boom tone has some very attractive features, such as lithological homogeneity, very low permeability and excellent restraint.
Under the boom tone, you can see a succession of changing layers of sand and clay.
At the Mol site and in its immediate vicinity, the sand layer under the boom tone is not used for pumping groundwater because of the high content of dissolved substances and the low yield.

Nostalgia goes into the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of history is simultaneously nostalgic for the glorious days of the characters of the eighties, for the 90-year-old grunge era (when the forebears David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By stiffening to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors playing horny children who will grow up - they nonetheless managed the impossibility of winning back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later," with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody goes more according to the watering principle, including a reef on the stalker films of the 1990s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The hand that shuffles the cradle").
At one point, a character stumbles through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The adorable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
And there's another crazy-vicious plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is now backed by George H. W. Bush (a well-liked impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It's particularly fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd showing off Matt Dillon's lower-lip barrage of "singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like an old knacker.
It's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" Series until he achieves what I assume to be his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the gang as they attend the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, is reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia: The revival of the Cold War from "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-Against-West wrestling iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director admits to being a found TV series: A Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two police officers as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-spoken Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some beautiful gags to the reputation (police spend time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chlo√´ Sevigny - makes for a decent game 'Find the voice out'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is included - that it often plays like a single one.
In six long episodes, it drags on, and the comedy isn't fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective," which has been edited to a lower length, could better deliver its agitprop satire, as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men devouring a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a fodder for a vow.

Blow to drug mafia in the country
Police managed a blow to the Italian mafia in Baden-W√ºrttemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest-Baar county, in Rottbecause, Constance, Esslingen and Stuttgart, according to the Constance County Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
15 accused, aged between 25 and 77, have been arrested and have already issued arrest warrants for them.
In addition, officials provided greater amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms as well as several hundred thousand euros.
In simultaneous raids in Italy, two people were arrested.
Against the two suspects Italians, there were German arrest warrants.
The two are therefore likely to be extradited to Germany.
The action involved Italian and Bavarian investigators.
In total, over 300 police officers were deployed.
Members of the mafia are accused of organised drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder and robbery and extortion.
Since the summer of 2016, the Prosecutor's Office has been investigating Constance against organised drug trafficking in the southern German region.
Between the prosecutors in Constance and Palermo, there was a brisk exchange and investigators from the Kripo Rottals had near-daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the major operation on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officers from Palermo.
The investigations mainly targeted Italian nationals with close links to the Italian mafia.
Also, an incident on May 27 in hats, where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, is likely to go to the gang's account.
Way laments big gaps in foreigners register
"Data from citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the foreigners register in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious errors in asylum procedures.
The federal government's envoy for refugee management, Frank-J√ºrgen Mode, has, according to a media report, drawn attention to large gaps in the Immigration Central Register.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to "some serious misconduct" in asylum procedures and deportations, Art warned in an analysis submitted to the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung.

Almost all circuses took over this form of ticket sales, and today most circuses practice a combination of subscription events and shows for which tickets can be purchased in free sales at the coffers or via the Internet.
The awarding of cards takes place in such a way that there is a separation of supporters of the playing teams by means of a division of subjects.
The so-called quota of tickets, that is to say their distribution to the participating countries, takes into account the interest of fans in these countries.
It must not happen that fans can purchase tickets for a block in the stadium that is not intended for them.
The cards must contain information about the holder and origin of the card so that their path can be traced back.
Compliance with stadium bans is achieved through the establishment of the system of reservation and distribution of tickets, as well as measures to prevent the transfer of the cards issued in whatever form.
- in principle, the buyer of the card is also the end user;
- the map includes the so-called supplement, in which the organizer definitely indicates
When awarding the available cards to the target groups, care must be taken to ensure that the general public and the fans of the participating teams have sufficient cards, in all fairness and in accordance with the European Community's competition rules.
If the reservation of a card is not made exclusively through the National Football Confederation or its own association of spectators / fans, the interested person must indicate the team of which he is a fan.
A buyer receives no more than two cards.
The final transfer of the cards takes place as late as possible (interchangeable voucher).
The organiser must provide the certainty that the person on whose behalf the card was issued - the ticket holder - will also receive his ticket.

The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have dampened speculation about a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it maintained interest rates on family incomes in the midst of intensifying pressure.
Policymakers on the Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members seeking a rise this month as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and to 1.6% in 2018, warning that pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the fall.
But it signaled that interest rate hikes would be needed in the next few years to rein in Brexit-fueled inflation and it said that borrowing costs may have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will demand time for the funding plan to provide cheaper funding to banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide ¬£15 billion more under this scheme - with ¬£115 billion.
Minutes after deciding on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term as pressure on real household incomes continues to weigh on consumption."
On interest rates, she reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and a "slightly larger" scale than markets expect.
Markets currently forecast the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that increases would be "gradual" and "limited."
The bank's downward revised growth forecasts for this year and next year are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after this news.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and fell 0.4% to $1.11.
The decision not to change comes after recent disappointing growth figures dampened rising expectations of a rate hike and GDP rose to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the bank rebounded towards the end of the year.
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and small wage increases, as tightening first gets worse before it will improve.
She added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" the income slump in the next few years, but she added that wages will recover "significantly" towards the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also bolstered by rising demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.25% last August after the shocking EU vote that caused the pound's decline.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy.
Before the Bank's latest ruling on interest rates, the call for a rate hike had risen as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers demanding a rise to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the bank said this was expected and it will rebound in the coming months.
The bank said the overrun relative to its 2% target was "entirely" attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as lenders clamour for deals and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those where the existing deals expire and the new mortgages close, and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular. "
NHS (The National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight before the High Court against funding the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 per cent, is now delivered by the health service through an initial three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal last year upheld a Supreme Court ruling that the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite claiming that local authorities should fund it.
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens as an "important new intervention," while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described this as a "crucial moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, and more clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV supplements taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission at risk of infection.
Taking prep before intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken every day or so two hours before intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been treated successfully.
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for possible attendance at their local participating sex clinic.
The programme will cost ¬£10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study aims to assess PrEP's overall potential by collecting clinical evidence on how it is targeted, absorbed and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: "This major new intervention should complement and overhaul the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than three decades of progress in tackling one of humanity's greatest health challenges. "
Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
Prep, if it is targeted at needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that PrEP test medicine has been obtained, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people. "
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Secretary, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and long overdue after months of delays and reluctant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV-infected and that it will help us move a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society '.
Living the big life: Mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court home into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, narrowed from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It lies on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's proof of the new design that Joanne hasn't packed and sold her bags.
"Before that, I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge," says Joanne.
'i was looking for something comparable to my price.
I was shown this flat in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day.'
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overtaken.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height.
'i wanted high ceilings, big windows, a lot of light.
That was my requirement, "she says.
To this end, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling wasn't big enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the requirement.
"The steel mill is pretty complicated," he explains.
'We had to arrange the rooms so they were stacked on top of each other without us having to bump.
It wasn't just about building a simple platform, but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below. ""
That arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full on top of each other - with plenty of extra drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.
In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can shut down the kitchen if it is not used.
Foldable kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A little bit of engineering went in there," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, furious MDF door.
'it's counterweight, so when you push up the door, it glides very easily '.
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to win an extra 16 sq ft, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you're going to sell the basic space - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the land size."
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor area while using high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and that therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
'you don't fall in love with the electric sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart.'
It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square metres of something standard into something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave them.
An architectural story with ups, downs and happy ending: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels in 1958 won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and passed away.
A Bogota journalist suggested that the fact that she was the preferred person who covered all the funerals and who had received all the prizes beforehand (gastronomy competition Easter, audience vote on the best hand-tailored costume and Reina Madre) had "made the other female candidates jealous, making the queen stressful, which therefore couldn't shine on stage."
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for the "Como en casa" program at the channel RCN, said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the contest does not, after all, become Queen."
You can judge for yourself when I say that a penalty and a red card were due.

Brothers fight over a $500 million property empire
Two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a confrontation because of one of the largest property imperial Victorias worth over $500 million.
Former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be shared.
Paul has wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp confrontation over separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Along with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the Westco family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
That money was invested in real estate, and De LUTIS's portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as shopping centres in the suburbs.
According to an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the De LUTIS family - owns about two-thirds of the company's wealth and Paul about a third.
A court file says this means Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem point for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought were the best objects," he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, ruled him out.
Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of managing some possessions incompetently.
In an early Affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Costs are rising in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Ms De LUTIS and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicacy shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little kid (about 10 years old)."
Anna De LUTIS says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property amicably to their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De LUTIS corporate group, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million while leaving the company and Luke $26 million.
Both Lukas and Mark, Paul says, have become "embittered about the terms of their financial separation."
Colin has been very restrained despite being a former AFL board member and, according to a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the television star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De LUTIS and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied by SMS to say "I really can't say much" because the case is before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and move our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he was trying to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he was "still hoping for a solution."
On Friday, that hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.

Kelly told staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information.'

But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know others - that Trump's tweets would have contained even more spark without their interventions.
We'll probably never learn anything about the tweets that Trump hasn't sent.
If his staff have managed to keep him out of trouble a few times, then their efforts have been worthwhile.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world.
Politico - entirely preoccupied with this story - reported in May on advisers "penchant for providing dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
'Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he's stiffened to find out where these came from.
That's exactly what happened in late February, when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, who accused Deputy Staff Chief Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a bunch of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he has offered no specific evidence or that he has made false allegations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives."
How did that work out?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still seeking influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
In short, they fear that all the sacrifices made for price stability will have been in vain.

In the current boom, there has been contagion within and across markets, as rising prices fuel enthusiasm - and thus further price increases - first within one city and then in other cities, even at the other end of the world.
Historically, home prices have gained enormous momentum, and prices in these cities are still rising rapidly, even though they are rising a little more slowly than they were a year or more ago.
Based on projections of growth trends, it seems certain that prices in most of these cities will rise substantially for another year or more, even if the rate of increase continues to fall.
Prices in glamour cities are likely to fall sharply in the next serious recession, or in the event of a shock to the local economy, and with interest rates rising too rapidly.
In that case, contagion within and across markets could set off a downward spiral, lowering prices for years to come.
Travellers negotiate a ditch and return to 'millionaire' row
Some of the West Midlands's wealthiest homeowners are back at war with some determined travellers who have negotiated a ditch drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull called the "millionaire series."
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were first ejected in May, but without being deterred by a ditch excavated by the council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in defence facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unobstructed to find a way.
Angry residents have pressed Solihull's council, which said that it was "useless to deal with the problem."
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday night after being sent on by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at the passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame, as it has been useless in dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably more today. "
She added: "Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instruction to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue to pay my local tax if the council can't even stop that.'
One local resident, who asked not to be named, said: "It's ridiculous, we've just seen the last round of these travellers, only to be looted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you've even seen a horse in the parking area. ""
A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp on the land beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihulls police... we are taking the necessary legal steps to ensure they move forward as soon as possible.
To support our evidence collection, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the Court must examine when we present our case. "

From Birkenhof, Waldhotel Luise
From the former Hotel Birkenhof will be the Forest Hotel Luise.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and is due to reopen on March 1 next year.
This is good news for the city.
After all, with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Operationgesellschaft mbH as of 13 April 2014, around 30 000 nights were lost per year and also revenue by the tourist tax.
In the fall of 2014, given dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the county, the hotel building was offered to the estate agent as a gathering shelter, causing controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not uncontroversial in the council at the time.
But in particular Freudenstadt's Lord Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and was already talking about serious prospective buyers at the house at the time.
He should be right.
The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four homes with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad men's alb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovations are being carried out.
The floors were torn out, blankets partly dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
By March, there is still much to do.
"It's actually a nice hotel," Thomas Scherer says in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are built in.
Everything should later become "beautifully citizen-friendly," as Thomas Scherer puts it.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it."
Swimming pool, spa area and a meeting room are among the facilities.
You don't want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an upscale inner-city level, Scherer points out.
The Forest Hotel Luise, with its about 60 rooms, wants to set up widely, Scherer explains.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or businessmen are expected to feel comfortable in the hotel.
Talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause have already led him, according to Scherer.
The city's ideas are equal to those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line." "
Asked about the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to be precise.
Just under $1 million, he reckons.
The outdoors are also put on the forearm, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard there is a large terrace that will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Joy City is a good market."
It's not an easy task, but it needs to be done now and there's no way around it.
The "much more important task" is imminent on Sunday.
Not a single accident is the same and calculating the cost of the parts and working hours can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The basic models usually only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
The joke of the matter is that the company is performing towards the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
These must also accept that the SIM card in their phone does not run on their name, so they cannot fully have it as the normal customers of mobile providers. "
"In these places, the traveller is also available a switch with trained staff that advises interested parties on Internet buying and also plays the coupon on the map," according to the spokesman for the project Martin Opatrn√Ω.
A passenger who doesn't ride suburban buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupon ends can in turn go to the self-service machines, where the coupons are played on the map.
The new elections are over, and now it's all about the coalition; in the debates on public television, party leaders barely looked into their cards.
Russia affair: U.S. special investigator sets up grand jury
In the Russia affair involving U.S. President Donald Trump, special prosecutor Robert Mueller is said to have set up a so-called grand jury after a report.
The panel has begun work in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal wrote, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper hailed the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.
CNN reported that there were already initial preliminary invitations from the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of specifically interfering in the 2016 presidential race.
Mueller is investigating whether there was any collusion between Trump's campaign and Moscow.
The focus of the investigation is expected to be several men who acted as an adviser to the Republican in the campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also scrutinized more and more of Trump's private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special prosecutor had personally moved Trump to the center and was investigating the allegation of whether the president may have obstructed justice in the wake of the affair.
The main task of Grand juries is to examine present evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether charges should be filed.
Grand juries are therefore also called dock chambers.
Mostly, they are turned on when they are bigger and more controversial cases.
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.
The panel can also be turned on by the prosecution to invite people for interrogation under oath.
According to CNN, precincts have already been issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his then-campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, were also involved in the conversation.
Legal experts said Thursday night on U.S. television that the setting shows that Mueller is not intimidating himself in his work and that, if necessary, he wants to act quickly.
It doesn't necessarily mean, however, that the Grand Jury will end up being turned on to decide whether to file a charge.
Yet the establishment of the panel is the start of a new phase in investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
Amid the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to portray the Russia affair as a campaign by his political opponents.
"Russia's history is a total invention," Trump said.
The issue gives Democrats a way to "feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about."
His special adviser, Ty Cobb, said in a statement that he knew nothing about setting up a grand jury.
But this also usually works in secret, he stressed.
The White House supports any measures that accelerated the special prosecutor's work in a "fair" way.
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that he is not investigating the president.
There is no reason to believe that this has changed, the statement said.
However, Mueller was only used after Trump fired Comey.
Because of that uproar, allegations against Trump had become loud, saying he wanted to obstruct the judiciary.
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to halt the investigation into then-national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.
After portraying U.S. media, the White House collected material against the special investigator and his staff.
That sparked speculation about whether Trump wanted to sack Mueller.
Unlike an independent congressional special investigator, such as in the Watergate affair of later President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired from the Justice Department at the president's insistence.
Several senators from both parties, however, want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators unveiled draft legislation on Thursday, according to which the special prosecutor could no longer be dismissed so easily.
Antarctica: Gigantic iceberg pushes in Antarctica
In western Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg of the almost seven-fold size of Berlin has dissolved from the Schelfeis.
The Bremerhavener Alfred Wegen Institute for Polar and Marine Research said on Wednesday.
The over a trillion-tonne and 5800-square-mile colossus is now tearing north and will probably take two, three years to melt.
It is at 175 kilometres in length and a width of up to 50 kilometres one of the largest ice giants researchers have registered over the past three decades.
A danger to people does not come from him.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in breaking the iceberg is unclear, according to research.
Overall, however, there have been a series of unusual collapses of ice shells in the region for about 30 years, writes the U.S. Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a fact-finding background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now aborted colossus has so far been a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.
Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It thus grows ever further into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this shelf spring, the balance of growing and breaking was disrupted a few years ago.
A complete Schelfeis fell apart there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a lot to be said for the fact that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is also at risk, because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is at present.
Moreover, the ice sheet is under tension and can disintegrate if a piece breaks down at a key point.
The melting of Schelfeis and iceberg does not increase sea levels as they swim on the water and displace ice as much water as it does after melting itself.
However, the loss of the skull causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and to drain much faster than before.
This could possibly increase sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the British Research Project for the Observation of Antarctica (Midas).
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis, according to AWI data with nearly 50 000 square kilometres, is Antarctica's fourth largest shelf.
On the transition from the mainland, it's up to 700 feet thick, on the front edge to the free ocean about 200 feet.
That's where it breaks down regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now coming into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of Britain's Swansea University.
"This is the furthest retreat since records began," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it is controversial whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will now grow again or go back long-term and possibly fall together, his colleague Adrian Luckman said, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But that development will take decades.
Even if these researchers do not attribute the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, a great many of the Antarctic peninsula's ice shells have been disintegrating in recent decades.
This long tip of Antarctica stretches towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the Antarctic Peninsula ice area has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The decline has contributed to the temperature rise.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by about three degrees in the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where the temperature is rising fastest.
The Adjustment Fund, subject to the Kyoto Protocol, is to be managed by a 16-member council, presumably at the UN's Global Environment Facility (GEF), as can be seen in the "Piac √©s profit."

CDU wants house fare on staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacant jobs, the CDU is demanding that it leave the employers "association to become more attractive.
It was only just before the summer break that the circular day waved through 41 new posts in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the county administration in Mettmann.
Now another 17 trainees have their first working day behind them.
The apprenticeships at the county appear to be very coveted.
About 620 applications were for the places to be awarded this year.
However, the county continues to lack staff to cope with the increased requirements and tasks.
At present, there are still 50 unfilled posts in Mettmann County.
Searches include doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration.
The CDU, together with the Free Democratic Party (FDP) and the UWG, now wants to take the initiative and address the lack of manpower in the administration.
The administration is expected to "devise a concept for recruitment and personnel development" according to the wishes of the parties.
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of professionals, but to counteract future-oriented candidate shortages, it says.
The overall approach should look inward and outward, identify concrete measures for crossbenchers and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FBI and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the county is dealing with staffing problems that you didn't know before.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
There is talk of a genuine "competition of public employers."
There is also a high number of staff who leave the service due to illness or age.
So it is high time to act so that more jobs are not left unfilled.
But Klaus-Dieter Peoples, leader of the CDU, still goes beyond the joint motion with his party.
He recently provided a rotten surprise in County Day, when he publicly challenged the human-cost cap and stunned the rest of the parties.
Peoples want to see a review of all options for leaving the local employers "association.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the county administration with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the circular cities - should seek a house tariff," Peoples added.
In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay employees and civil servants better than the public service tariff scheme actually provides.
Salaries are currently strictly prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you move to a higher level that is modelled on professional years.
But the county's tasks have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new spaces had to be set up where employees were concerned about the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act.
Not least by the rising number of asylum seekers, Councillor Thomas Hendele and county director Martin Richter have a problem: They have too few staff.

Italy tightens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs using lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they may not continue to do so unless they abide by new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs don't sign a new code of conduct, it's difficult to see how they can continue to work," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnii's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a boat from the German aid organisation 'Youth Return' because their team had effectively worked with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid agency, which has only been in operation for a year, declined to comment on detailed allegations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio CARTOSIO.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organization said in an opinion on social media.
"We can only judge all the accusations currently being made after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation."
Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat from 'Youth rescues', the Iuventa, since October.
It is believed its crew will take tugboat migrants on board, which will be delivered to them directly by traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart so the ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the content of which was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of flouting the authority of the Italian coastguard, which monitors rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons rather than any other motives.
Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must mainly have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable, as they would not involve "significant changes or obstructions" of their bailouts.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti, meanwhile, said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue efforts in Italy had declined sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperate with local mayors had borne fruit.
"In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
A modest home market compared to global sales.
The Central and Eastern European countries have become more important for Switzerland since their accession to the EU, both as production sites and as sales and procurement markets.
When the price of oil reached $150 a barrel, sales in the US already shifted in favor of more economical models.
At BMW, growth rates in sales of the first six months of the year were even 100 per cent.
We also have this experience in investing in the sales of road cars.
And he adds that providing information about a company's philanthropic activities is just as important as communicating sales or competitor information at board meetings.
Sales at TrueView-Ads, i.e. advertising clips played either before the start of a video or displayed as display advertising alongside it, also rose 45 percent last year.
The skilled industrial engineer (Bercht) and the robotics specialist (Guernier) are convinced that their product will find sales, and expect 80 000 to 100 000 airbags sold annually for the future.
Sales of computers, printers, servers, and additional storage capacity will fall short of software and services for now, but will catch up over time, perhaps even boosting yields in the hard-fought PC market.
After a 10 percent decline over the previous year in the first quarter of 2013, PC sales to firms in the second quarter moved to roughly the same level in quarterly terms, which suggests a stabilization of sales figures.
Climbs and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met at Wachenheim in the northern pfalz to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
Accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
Wachenheim's castle and wine test was a welcome extra.
The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Michael's chapel above Deidesheim.
It followed vantage points, partly on towers, from which you could look far beyond the putter forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there have always been longer rises, for which long trials have been rewarded.
On the second day it went to Bad D√ºrkheim to the Saline and the folk festival sausage market.
Again, vantage point lined up at vantage point, connected by "floated" trials and moderate climbs.
On the last two days, again, many altitude meters were required.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and entry huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad D√ºrkheim, the bikers in the open-air inhaler breathed healing soles.
Neustadt was also headed.
After 173 kilometres and nearly 4500 altitude metres, the group had met the putter forest from its best side - sporting and cultural.
Console instead of turf - Bundesliga gears up for e-sports
Do sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future, instead of getting swept up in wind and weather over the stadium rallies?
The fact is, e-sport has long become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gales included.
This has also been recognized by the first federal ligaclubs, which are increasingly engaged in this area.
The beginning was made in 2015 by VfL Wolfsburg, later followed by FC Schalke 04 and most recently VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract.
"We hope to inspire whole new young target groups for the VfB," says executive director Jochen R√∂ttgermann.
He is sure "that on this train a number of clubs are still rising."
Next weekend, FIFA is organising the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London, where the gamers of various clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutton also sees great potential in e-sport.
The ex-coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal in particular with the 14 to 30-year-olds that young people are still going to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-athletes under contract, you could be present online far more often in these markets than just once a year sending the federal government to Asia.
What exactly is it about?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or just the football simulation FIFA are fought at competition level.
Long ago, as in normal sport, leagues have established themselves in which the pros compete against each other.
And in the 2022 Asian Games, e-sport is already part of the official program.
But is it a proper sport at all?
For many, the notion is surely habitual.
Ingo Frobous has also long dealt with the question.
For the professor at the German Sports School in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sport - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also needs cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding, and rapid responsiveness.
Professional gamers should train not only at the console but also their bodies and pay attention to the diet.
"The fitter player is a good player."
However, Frobous also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more of an issue."
Checks were difficult to implement in online games, and at the scene the structures of classical sport were missing.
Positively, the scientist highlights the high inclusive impact of e-sport.
The players are travelling internationally, which is like a big global family, as there are no intercultural obstacles.
A study by consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts e-sport's rapid growth.
In 2016, EUR 50 million was implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to be 130 million.
Against the almost $2.4 billion of the Football League, that is little.
However, e-sport is "no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte advisers write.
Internationally, many countries have already moved on.
Big markets are Asia and the United States, where ex-basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez join US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in eSports betting provider Unikrn.
Some things are happening in Europe, too.
In a Norwegian school, e-sport was introduced as a teaching subject, Frobous says.
In the Netherlands and France, football first-team clubs are now required to set up an e-sports department, according to Dutton.
"In the European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB board member R√∂ttgermann.
Just falling into nostalgia, and clarifying the old times, is no longer enough today.
It is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time aligning the company in the modern market.
"We live in a digitised world," Dutton also suggests.
'Because you can't stick to the fact that only in football everything stays the way it always is.'
Unfortunately, the European system of government art finance is falling victim to slow economic growth and growing budget deficits.
An immediate deployment of an adequate civilian and security presence during the months immediately following NATO's bombing campaign in 1999 might have created appropriate safeguards against the backlash that turned victims into perpetrators.
As part of one of these projects, developing countries are to be provided with medical information via the Internet, another project is to provide communication equipment and experts for use in emergencies and humanitarian emergencies, and a third is to provide vaccination protection to a significant number of children worldwide.
However, access to resources is only part of the problem and I would like to emphasise once again the importance of denouncing the production, distribution and use of these indiscriminate weapons.
The Forum, which successfully concluded its fourth meeting in February 2000, deals specifically with forest issues from the point of view of sustainable forest management, addressing not only the underlying causes of deforestation, but also the trade in forest products and the use of market-based instruments for forest conservation.

Poison eggs ade - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking
The scandal over poison-contaminated eggs has now affected almost all federal states.
Aldi South and Aldi Nord have responded and have taken all eggs out of sale throughout Germany.
On the shelves, only eggs are to be taken, which demonstrably do not contain a fipronil.
In this performance-wise very balanced encounter, however, Marcus Blasutto's TSV team consistently agreed to the great physical dedication and a pleasing commitment of both teams.
The Council is currently examining the extent to which these mechanisms are included in Article 7.
We therefore ask the rapporteur, the Commission and the Council to supplement the agricultural policy part with the fisheries policy part, for example by making the title "agricultural policy aspects of enlargement" "agricultural and fisheries policy aspects of enlargement."
I would particularly like to address the Council, which is, unfortunately, essentially absent, but which has some expectations and concerns.
It has now been tried again by the mixed feed industry to influence the Council and to overturn the open declaration.
I would like to point out to Members that the Council working group has unanimously decided to recommend to the Council that a joint committee be set up in the action programme to increase the influence of the individual Member States through a combination of management and advisory procedures.
In our view, the report contains a disagreement on the issue, on which my group does not agree, namely whether the establishment of an internal auditor should only be required for the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament, or even for the smaller institutions.
There are two examples of this: The Education Council, in conjunction with the agenda item on the mobility of students and teachers, because we have seen a great disparity in mobility, and the Internal Market, Consumption and Tourism Council, in conjunction with the agenda item on the development of electronic commerce, in order to make it accessible to all women and men, because here too, as we know, there is inequality between women and men.
I must therefore admit that this amendment, as the Council and the Commission have said, is not justified in this case, and I would like to take this opportunity to remind you once again that the procedures for import controls in the European Union do not work, that fraud is committed and that these cases of fraud are not only bad for the Community taxpayer, but also bad for the functioning of the internal market and even for fairness towards third countries.
The Commission and the Council will do their part, and that is the most important thing that is currently on the agenda in Yugoslavia; that has always been our interest.
As far as the Intergovernmental Conference is concerned, the work before Biarritz at ministerial level had, I believe, already progressed as far as possible, and the informal Council therefore took place at the right time to confirm certain progress in order to provide guidelines for the final phase we are now in.
Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate the European Council for adopting the draft Charter as binding.
Meeting the demands of the large countries for more power in the Council and Parliament would upset the balance within the European Union and cause the small countries to pay all the price for enlargement.
We must support the efforts of Mr Prodi and Mr Patten to strengthen the Commission's ability to act through parliamentary insight and the necessary parliamentary control, which does not relate to the Council and Mr Solana.
Although we share the criticism of the Council on many points, it remains to be seen that it would be a politically unmediated confrontation and would undermine credibility in European institutions.
I do not want to get the impression that the Council is not responding to the questions put to it.
The Council is actively examining the Commission's proposal and the aforementioned amendments in order to reach an opinion on this issue as soon as possible.
At the time, we did not yet know that the Council and the Commission had promised assistance from these funds for reconstruction in Serbia and Kosovo.
Mr President, the Council has really surpassed itself with the draft budget it presented for 2001.
In this respect, and also in view of the Commission's acknowledgement that the Member States' demands for payments for the Structural Funds for 2001 exceed the estimates of the PDB by 8 billion, I think it is time for the Council to think very seriously now that we need to do something about payments and not increase the 'RAL'.
In due course, such a support and signalling effect will also be necessary in relation to the Council.
Several proposals are already before the Council and Parliament, such as the package of proposals to recast and update hygiene rules.
I would therefore ask that the Council, which is not here, and the Commission should be informed of the importance of increasing this amount, since, unfortunately, between 20 and 50 new mines are being laid for each cleared mine.
Abandoning the requirement for closer cooperation within the framework of the Treaty, as well as abolishing the right of veto and the possibility of submitting the issue to the European Council, would be a violation of fundamental principles of European cooperation within the EU.
The General Affairs Council agreed in October last year to the first five action plans for Somalia, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Morocco and Iraq.
The committee responsible has followed me in this, and the signals from the Council are also pleasantly positive.
The Council will have to ask itself whether, by granting candidate status to Turkey, it has not done more harm than good to this cause.
The Council adopted a common EU strategy for the Mediterranean at its meeting in Feira in June 2000, and the European Commission, having proposed and implemented the reform of the MEDA Regulation, recently presented a document on the intensification of the Barcelona Process.
The Commission and the Council express their willingness to do so.
In the interests of rapprochement between Armenia and Azerbaijan, what diplomatic initiatives does the Council intend to take to resolve their bilateral differences and to promote their cooperation?
Secondly, the Council refers in its response to NATO as Pontius Pilate, without commenting on Turkey's provocative violation of Greece's sovereign rights, which was expressed this time on the occasion of the NATO manoeuvre.
Other countries, however, absolutely want the compensation fund, and I must tell you quite frankly that if we were now to propose a compulsory introduction of the compensation fund, the result would be that we could forget the whole thing, because there would never be a majority in the Council.
Let me give you an example: As you know, there were difficulties for the Council in banning the export of products deemed unsafe to third countries, whereas this ban is very important for the European Parliament and we fully support it.

The European Council is also preparing a declaration on the economic, social and cultural characteristics of sport and its social function in Europe.
His voice would be stronger and the voice of the ministers who defend agriculture in the service of sustainable development would also be much stronger in the Council if it could be based on decisions taken here in the codecision procedure.
As Mr Brok wanted in his report, the Council will have overview documents detailing relations between the Union and the individual partner countries in order to make better use of the Union's overall efforts to increase its efficiency and to better prepare its debates on foreign policy measures.
I would also like to point out that, within the framework of all the positions taken by the Council, there is no budgetary obligation on the part of the European Union to finance any military activity.
Furthermore, it is completely illogical that only the Council can amend the Financial Regulation, and we repeat our conciliation motion on this point.
On many points, as Mr Watts has already explained, the European Parliament takes a stricter stance than seems to be the case in the Council.
Discussions have also been held with the sectors concerned and there have been numerous contacts with the French Presidency with a view to reaching a consensus text that can be adopted quickly by the two legislative bodies, the Council and the European Parliament.
I would like to say to Mr Jarzembowski that the Council is not seeking a compromise.
"It is clear that there can be an incompetent and provocative official, but if 15 Member States agree to such answers, I think you must take the initiative and urge the Council to respect a prerogative of Members of the European Parliament.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that the debate on proportionality (votes in the Council and seats in Parliament), that is to say on the balance of power between the Member States, has opened up a pandoriasis that will be difficult to close again in Nice.
The report has been the subject of difficult discussions in the Council.
I have been told by my chairman of the Committee on Budgets that this is the first time that an agreement has been reached between the Council and Parliament in a conciliation.
Ultimately, it was the weighting of votes in the Council that was most debated and where it was most difficult to reach a decision.
As a representative of the groups in the European Free Alliance, I would like to warn the Commission, but especially the Council, in the event that the EU does not want to be more than an intergovernmental community.
But the Nice European Council, like many other summits in the history of the European Union, represents a victory for reality, a victory for pragmatism over utopia.
If the Council wanted to do that, it would behave unwisely and unwisely.
Secondly, has the Council been informed by the Human Rights Commissioner of the Council of Europe, who is well represented on the ground?
What improvements will the Council make to Directive 92 / 12 / EEC, which is referred to here, so that the responsibilities of the supplier and the recipient are clearly defined without the possibility of fraud?
In accordance with Article 23 of the Treaty on European Union, such a decision will be taken unanimously by the Council, as will all other decisions on defence policy.
Mr President, as the Groupement Europ√©en des Soci√©t√©s d'Auteurs et de Compositeurs has rightly pointed out, the draft we are discussing has been attacked in a disproportionate manner in the course of its examination by the Council.
Secondly, this issue will be on the agenda at the Telecommunications Council next Friday.
At the trialogue meeting, it became clear that the Council was not prepared to make concessions on this issue.
The precautionary principle was also discussed at the Nice Summit, which took note of a resolution adopted by the General Affairs Council.
The 2001 budget is largely based on a compromise between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, which we support.
The Nice European Council had a positive aspect: By deciding on a new weighting of votes and a new distribution of MEPs, with the participation of the Eastern European candidate countries, it gave them a strong signal of their willingness to accept them as soon as possible.
Michelle Carter convicted of the texts pushing Conrad Roy to suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended.
Carter was convicted in June of negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who took life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend.'
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream-coloured blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and down eyes when she was convicted.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," prosecutors told the court.
'she ended his life to make her own better.
She took no responsibility, "she said.
"She has shown no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "terrible circumstance that she completely regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find out that her "age or maturity or even her mental illness have a significant impact on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother Lynn Roy, who said that there is "no day when I don't mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything... I try to be there for his sisters despite all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity, "it says.
Rooney's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she was "persecuted" by the realisation that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
"No longer having this only person I've been with every day since my birth is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang on, spring from a building, expose yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You've got to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention through Roy's death and ordered that she should benefit from the case through any press.
The case has divided legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British co-worker in Italy in 2007 before she was acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, posted a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."

Joshua Kimme: Learning from Bayern's new mini-Lahm
That Joshua Kimme was allowed to run at the Audi Cup as captain is no coincidence.
Bayern are mourning the Confed-Cup winner a big season - extra motivation doesn't hurt there.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, which saw Joshua Kimme immediately, even though the extra garment was very, very small.
But since far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, there was no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer to see either, he made the bind assigned to him stop at the arm.
"The coach didn't announce it," the Confed-Cup winner told me afterwards, after his first effort as Bayern captain.
Well, the concussion could have run better than at 0-2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign from the coach could interpret Kimme as well.

So if you've been singled out to take up the legacy of Lahm, you can only use a little extra motivation well.
Kimme confirmed: "That's what you want as a player: Take responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flipped across the field as a mini-Lahm.
Right at the back, that's now his position, the white dash on the arm did their rest.
And at all, in this starting rotation, Kimme seemed like the one who can best take the helm.
He gave instructions, trying to steer the unrecorded squad.
He had the look for the whole thing, while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal is overplaying his lack of fitness (barely worked out); Renato Sanches is tying devil to the achievements of the Asian trip (even limited); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas S√ºdle do not turn negative in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
That, after all, worked out quite well.
South ran alongside Kimme, Rudy in front of the defence, both acting handily.
The notoriously occupied Napoli Storm was often struggling, and South also tried successfully in the game building a few times.
While his colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not as we hoped."
But he also showed a proper performance on debut.
Game shift, pace change: "For that style, I was picked too."
How unassuming this Baylor world is still for the rebounds, you saw following the match.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two in the catacombs, but certainly gave six or seven interviews.
Kimme passed away after a few crisp statements in the back of his new fellow players.
There, he heard an interesting phrase from S√ºdle: "What's going on here, I've already realised now.
At Bayern you just have to win every game. ""
After all, he no longer needs to teach the new.
Alaba motivates √ñFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our √ñFB ladies
Austria's best-known footballer reported on Twitter just before the game and wished the √ñFB ladies all the best.
The Bavarian Legionaire is virtually a club columnist of √ñFB captain Schnaderbeck and fiddles with our Ladys.
The tweet from Austrian Football of the Year and Champions League winners should be a special motivational injection.
The famous Baylor Dusel might need our ladies as well.
It was announced in court that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after testing drugs from Class A had been discovered in his hair, his wallet and on his credit cards.
It was announced in court that he had called key players in the drug trade, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed them of what investigators knew about them.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
In court, the defendant initially claimed he was suffering from severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died alongside him in an explosion.
The court didn't have to hear any of the injured women.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700-page law, and also argued that the health-care law's requirement that states either expand access requirements for Medicaid, or otherwise eliminate all state Medicaid subsidies, was not unconstitutional.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in the court to cheer the new president, and, unlike the Mubarak-era presidential prunk, traffic was stopped only briefly so that the car convoy could cross the usually busy road linking the city center with the southern suburbs.
But by shedding the official oath before the court and not, as usual, before parliament, he bows to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
What is difficult is that, in court, rockers almost always abide by a law for them - and not testify.
Company satisfied with Rhineland plucky minister: Economy praises Wissing's pace
It often unfolded irreconcilably, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still economy minister of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new economy minister, Volker Wissing (FDA), is in office.
Chambers and businesses from the region speak at T V's request of a change in economic policy - while simultaneously tapping the old minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Association of Trident Companies (VTU), says, "Wissing picks up the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked."
Natus sees the biggest turnaround in infrastructure policy: The closing of Highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's list of priorities.
Later this year, the ministry is hoping for a planning process, by 2021, to stand by construction law.
A role in the country's plans also plays the western bypass of Trier, which is in the primary need of the federal road map.
The aim is to get the route into operation in December 2020, says ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a signpost to bolster regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier, as suggested by Wissing, is seeking a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and halt the trend of German wine exports, which have been plummeting for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, the IHK praises.
The craft chamber Trier sees an additional incentive for young trainees in the new Masters bonus, says managing director Matthias Schwalbach.
Provision is made for a premium of ¬£1,000 for the passing master exam and ¬£2,500 if graduates make themselves independent within 10 years after master training.
However, the homework list for the country remains long.
The planned road construction is quick to create facts, at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, chief executive of IHK Trier.
Of 56 new engineers who want to hire Wissing at the national company Mobility, only 29 jobs have been filled so far.
The IHK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices.
CDU Group member Christian Baldwin points to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country is investing more than $20 million less in maintaining national roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country as it seeks to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
Also sobering is the previous broadband expansion in the country.
In 2016, regional companies rated net supply in an IHK survey only with the score 3.4.
They complained about stalled internet connections and abortions.
By contrast, former Economy Minister Eveline Lemke is now out of politics, and is still on the board of the wind-power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke for April to become president of a private college in Karlsruhe - where it already cleared the field after four months because of disagreements.
They learned these lessons so well that when government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly began to change course this summer as a result of low birth rates and aging populations, encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their response was immediate and definitive: "Definitely not."

Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - carmakers face a backlash
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the ventures as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to car manufacturers of installing plants to neutralise emissions from diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with coddling the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes, which include the use of so-called switch-off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested but return in normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several employees of Volkswagen have been indicted, while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in Audi's engine development in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be put on trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was included in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was extended.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: The luxury carmaker contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen's profit.
Instead of immediately helping to establish structures to guarantee humanity in the R√∂szke camp, our Chancellor has made the Hungarian Government's attitude into the orbit of National Socialism highly official and public.
When negotiations began six months ago, it was Britain's turn to take over the presidency of the European Council.
This is exactly what the European Commission did recently when it presented its first strategy for the post-Kyoto Ar√§, which the European Council will discuss in March.
The Commission has the task of monitoring the practical application of this legal framework within the framework of its role defined by the Treaty.
I therefore believe that it is entirely appropriate, in this case, to entrust an external and morally unquestionable authority with this task.
That remains a task for the future.
Madam President, reference has been made to what could be the task of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
Enlargement has presented you and all of us with the same task that Monnet and Schuman and others faced fifty years ago: To develop a method, a structure and a vision for the future of Europe.
This message has the float Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
To ensure that the Isar visitors also participate, a float travels through Munich tomorrow Saturday, which has a special message.
Whoever pulls it back to the Isar on Saturday will see a big float there between Flaucher and Reichenbachbridge.
And this is not a usual float, with Isar tourists.
Instead, the building secretary wants to enlighten.
On the float, you can see a large infatuation parlour.
It shows a rubbish mountain.
The prelude to a publicity campaign to appeal to Isar visitors.
The motto "True love is..." aims to sharpen understanding of the Isar as a protective wild flow.
Even last summer, the float drove over the Isar and even this year there are other actions and measures to achieve reckless and environmentally conscious behaviour.
The European Monetary Cooperation Fund (EFWZ), headed by a board of directors composed of the members of the Committee of Central Banks and a member of the Commission, is primarily responsible for ensuring the functioning of the European Monetary System (EWS) created in March 1979 as a substitute for the "snake."
However, this monetary mechanism of the EMS differs from that of the 'snake' by the fact that the EMS has been accepted by all the Member States (the United Kingdom and Greece are not yet involved in the intervention mechanism for the time being), so that it is a Community system.
However, this monetary mechanism of the EMS differs from that of the 'snake' by the fact that the EMS has been accepted by all the Member States (the United Kingdom and Greece are not yet involved in the intervention mechanism for the time being), so that it is a Community system.
This was the mechanism that became famous under the name "snake in the tunnel" (European currency snake).
The "snake" represented the narrower range of fluctuations permitted for intra-Community currency exchange, while under the term "tunnel," the wider range of fluctuations granted for the exchange of Community currencies in dollars was understood.
In the meantime, the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (established in 1973 to manage the snake in the bandwidth mechanism) continues to serve as a precursor to the new institution.
It is forbidden to hunt, catch, disrupt, kill, live or dead animals (in Upper Austria these are most birds and snakes, as well as all lizards and amphibians), to purchase, damage, sell, transport or surrender to other people.
Banotti just something that he cares more about snakes than horses.
He did a lot for our snakes, but around our horses he didn't care. ""
I have too much respect for the dogs, let the snakes zish, our caravan continues with the quiet certainty that every non-European invasion in the evening was followed by a Poitier, a Lepante, a Vienna.
Objectives c. In 1972, the mechanism of the "snake in the tunnel" reduced the range of fluctuations between the Community currencies (snake) against the bandwidth between these currencies and the dollar (tunnel).
It joined the exchange-rate stability mechanism and resigned, and the snake, originally conceived as a community-based agreement, was reduced to a zone of currency stability around the DM.
(Snake) to ¬± 2.25% and limit the fluctuation width between these currencies and the dollar (tunnel) to ¬± 4.5%.
Community fluctuations to 2.25% (the "snake") were further applied by the original Member States of the Community and Denmark; the fluctuation of these currencies against the dollar (the "tunnel") was limited to 4.5%.
The return of the French franc to the queue, the relatively satisfactory functioning of this system and the introduction of a European unit of account have characterised this development.
In 1975, negotiations were held on the inclusion of the Swiss franc in the "snake," thereby contributing to greater exchange-rate stability in Europe.
The logical consequence of this was that there were recurrent difficulties in the foreign exchange markets: The French franc left the "queue," the pound and lira suffered sharp declines in international foreign exchange markets, and the Deutsche Mark was upgraded to relieve the snake.
Rebalancing the intervention rates within the "snake"; the DM's guide rate will be upgraded by 2% compared to the ERE.
Within the "snake," two exchange-rate adjustments have taken place, both affecting Scandinavian currencies.
In setting prices for 1978 / 79, this border adjustment was reduced, but increased again as a result of exchange-rate changes in floating currencies and appreciation within the queue.
In the system's start-up period, non-snake member states can opt for something more bandwidth over a limited period of time.
The question remains whether it will be able to resist the ups and downs that brought down the "snake."
The former "floated," the latter were involved in the snake and could only fluctuate in a given frame.
In the EMS, the unit of account for the "snake" will be replaced by the ECU, which corresponds to the value of the ERE and is therefore about 21% below the value of the "snake unit."
However, the UK and Ireland, followed by Italy, are leaving the "queue."
The European Rut, however, has also had undeniable successes: The British renegotiations of 1975th the general direct election of the European Parliament, and on 12 March 1979 the introduction of the European Monetary System (EMS), which replaced the "snake."
This construction became known as' snake in the tunnel ', with the fluctuations between the Community currencies forming the snake and the external fluctuation limits allowed by the IMF forming the tunnel.
The three candidate countries, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark, joined the queue in May 1972 but were unable to comply with the associated discipline and have left the queue again after a few months.
In early 1974, France and Italy also left the queue, which thus consisted of only a small number of currencies under the leading position of the Deutsche Mark.
This was the birth of the "snake in the tunnel."
The snake was thus half as wide (2.25%) as the tunnel (4.5%).
It was also decided that interventions aimed at keeping European currencies within the queue should, in principle, take place in European currencies, while dollar interventions should only be allowed to prevent the snake from breaking out of the tunnel.
The EEC Commission then proposed a common float of European currencies against the dollar - that is, keeping the snake but leaving the tunnel - including the possibility of changing the parities within the snake within certain limits and under certain conditions.
In September 1974, French Finance Minister Fourcade proposed a plan for a "coordinated floating" of all Community currencies to achieve closer coordination between the five snake currencies and the four separate floating currencies.
As a starting point, he recommended the previous snake, but wanted to surround it with a kind of broader and more elastic "Boa," in which European currencies outside the queue would be included.
This outer shell could have larger bandwidths than the snake and include a possible option to join and exit the currencies.
In December 1975, the Belgian Prime Minister, Mr Tindemans, in his report on the European Union, developed a series of proposals to consolidate the snake, which should be of a Community nature and extend its activities to the key areas of economic and monetary policy.
According to Leo Tindemans, the strengthening of the snake should also encourage a gradual return to greater international monetary stability, with the first stage being the creation of larger stability zones in the world where exchange rates would be kept stable.
This target zone for floating currencies should gradually move towards the snake to the extent that the weighting in favor of the snake would shift.
Some may see the European Monetary System as nothing more than an extended and revamped "snake."
As with the snake, belonging to the EWS is voluntary.
While France, Italy, and Ireland have decided to participate alongside the former snake countries (i.e., BR Germany, Denmark, and the Benelux), Britain decided in 1978 to remain outside the exchange-rate mechanism that constitutes the essential part of the EMS.
The obligations associated with participation are broadly similar to those that existed within the queue: One currency may fluctuate at most by 2.25% relative to another on both sides of its bilateral parity (for the Italian lira, however, that range is currently 6%).
- The distance between these two ECU courses serves as a basis for calculating the deviation indicator, which is a novelty of the EMS compared to the snake.
There has been a long debate as to whether the obligation to intervene in relation to the ECU or using the joint grid should be determined according to the example of the snake.
However, those Member States that did not belong to the "snake" in December 1978 (namely France, Italy and Ireland) had the opportunity to choose larger bandwidths up to 6%.
- Internal monetary policies: These include, in particular, interest-rate policies, which can directly affect the movement of capital and contribute to easing tensions, as experience with the "snake" has shown.
The mechanism of the deviation indicator has thus brought two important innovations to the snake system: For the first time, there is an objective basis for initiating consultations between the competent authorities, which goes well beyond the purely fundamental agreement of consultations left to the participants' initiative.
Entry into force of the Basel Agreement, which introduces a system of reduced bandwidth in the EEC - the snake (bandwidth of 2.25%) in the tunnel (+ 2.25%).
The pound sterling, the Irish pound and the Danish crown join the snake.
The Danish crown leaves the snake.
The Italian lira leaves the snake.
The Norwegian and Swedish crown join the snake.
The Swedish crown leaves the queue; devaluation of the Danish and Norwegian crown by 5% compared to the ewre.
Norway leaves the queue.
Chapter II again summarises these earlier attempts, from the formulation of a number of objectives in the Treaty of Rome to the concerted float of certain European currencies in the "snake."
Chapter III addresses in detail the content of the EMS and its mechanisms (exchange rate and intervention mechanism, the role of the ECU, credit systems), emphasising in particular the innovations of these mechanisms compared to the 'snake' and analysing the conditions for proper functioning in abstracto.
In the system's start-up period, non-snake member states can opt for something more bandwidth over a limited period of time.
Two areas of Community activity had so far been excluded from the scope of the ERE: The transactions of the European Monetary Cooperation Fund, which was based on ewre, a unit of account based on the key prices of the snake's currencies, and the common agricultural policy, which used the 'representative rates', the equivalent of which was decided by the Council in national currencies.
The candidate countries also join the "snake."
The English and Irish pounds divorced from the queue.

Mordillos Knollennasen and the laughter against suffering
Mordillo was, at times, one of the most-published cartoon characters, saying his characters' cravings are his trademark.
Even at 85, the Argentine is still drawing and working on a film.
His message: Laugh, "because there's too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first few years as an artist, he struck out, among other things, as a character for lucky cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when lost in my job," he once said.
After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he made the breakthrough in the late 1960s: With the release of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Time and again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Big, roundly Mordillo figures tumble in drawings with the sliding tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own data, he still sits at the drawing table today, working almost 10 hours every day.
Across calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, T-shirts, plush animals and watches, his droopy characters continue to find much spread worldwide.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his characters.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand feet as an antagonist.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which is due to arrive on the cinema screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's strange to me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
That's why he tends to rely on the TV series, which, like its original drawings, is silently produced.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union spends ‚Ç¨1 to meet its commitments, France gives just 10 cents and means a comparable commitment.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
He has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is declining because of drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing major headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the lifespan of lavender.
There's also a small cicade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicades, and in very dry weather there's a lot of it.'
And there is a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts for holidaymakers, it is also very much needed for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant clocks with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "
The solutions being considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we didn't score one or two more goals. ""

The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
Staff at the weekly Riodoce normally meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for coverage of the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They have been told that it is important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: Taking their children to the office, which was the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a plaque at the front of the room: Opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and abdominal feelings are enough.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make Mexico's chaos dangerous.
There is no respite from the violence, and as corpses accumulate across the country, more and more journalists are involved: At least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and there have been at least seven deaths in seven states so far this year.
Among the latter is her editor and her inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical panamahut.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and reporters discuss their divided themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor was established in 2010 to handle the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, it has only launched two criminal proceedings.
As with most thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organized crime every year, journalists "killers are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating Sinaloa's violence, although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we all distrust."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably because of the newspaper's name - which is translated with "Twelve River."
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a woman and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is virtually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as rival factions here struggle to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings that are bigger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "calm" when only one cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Still, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.
He believes two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the release of an interview with Damascus-Lopez, a leader of one of the rival antitrust factions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This release may have angered the sons, suspected gangmembers bought every copy of the issue once it was shipped to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He served as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined forces with five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold $50 holdings.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the narcotics problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for her coverage in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history, wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was scared.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October.
'you have to take on the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in the face of so many deaths... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his spoil?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive.
"You don't like it when you deal with their women, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways" to move drugs.
"These things weren't allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best of times, is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell a sense that can be misled... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions, and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
Suddenly, in the room where Riodoce's staff met for security training, no cell phones were allowed; days earlier, it was announced that spyware sold exclusively to governments was being used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ¬∞ C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect Riodoce's offices in a four-storey building in a midsize district of Culiacan.
Half in jest, some of the reporters wondered whether those officers were among the 50 percent of police officers the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It's been months since reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's edition, Riodoce has penned on three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an expos√© on government spending focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word on who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was required when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: That the restaurant is a favourite local of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels for almost the whole century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have viewed Valdez's column as the best-informed source about the kidnapping.
"Before, we'd already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed El Flaco because of its slim body stature.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez's office has been rededicated to the storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because staff have become something they themselves never expected: Activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning because of another journalist to the prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body has been discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, that it is his.
Across the country, journalists have become more vocal by writing down "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
That day, the director, Bojorquez, is away in Washington and is trying to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez's assassination, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
She has since asked that she be re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organized crime, government officials involved, and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces stuck under a blanket with organized crime.
The media watchdog group "Articulo 19" assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to police and officers last year.
"In Mexico, you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut," Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a chilling effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to her severed head.
Some branches have chosen to close, according to the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua following the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of its director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the headline "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as appears to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women at a home in Mexico City three months after fleeing from Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue working, it's a daily dance with risky choices.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last edition had already ended, Riodoce's editors sat on the pavement in front of the office and drank beer when, at one time, all their phones began to sum up.
A string of shootings involving gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region.
From the brothel edge, they have posted the news on Riodoce's website via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens howled nearby - another shootout in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at police officers holding guard to see if they were in readiness.
If they were scared at all, they didn't show it.
Under the enormous portrait of the newspaper's fallen founder, whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa, Riodoce's staff followed his tracks.
"How can you just think about closing," Bojorquez said, "when on the same day that Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the street for coverage."
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling had "missed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by dropping the decisions until after the election.

After the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Beaten presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some protesters who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in prison in August and others raped.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and judicial authorities had established a committee to investigate the post-election unrest and the government's response to it, but so Amnesty said the mandates and power of these bodies would be unclear and that the results obtained by parliamentary committees had not been published.
Eide has denied all the accusations, but he also said that Galbraith's accusations - which were fired - "undoubtedly caused harm to the mission because there was already a great deal of scepticism regarding international interference in the election."
Having separated from Georgia during the conflict of 1992-1993, with several thousands of people dying, Abkhazia wants to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.

Dinosaurs used camouflage to evade his enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhino of a Canadian miner have been so well preserved that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
It was so well preserved that they could even find that his scalding skin was of reddish brown - and they said she'd had something of a "troubled past."
The report in the journal Current Biology described him as "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosaurier that lived in the middle of the chalk period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly well-preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivores is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He hit on something that seemed misplaced by the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
They spent the next six years exposing the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) heavy earth clump.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you just blinded a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it slept," said principal author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that although this herbivores is covered with an armor and resembles a changing tank, it was likely threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to blend better into its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family first made headlines in May and is now seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours carefully revealing it.
The astonishing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armaments across his body.
They discovered the counter-shading, a common defence method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although counter-shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure by meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favoured the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use congestion - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signals that this nodosaurier has been subjected to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the chalk period must have been," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur's skin was red brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved intestinal content, to find out what it eaten as its last meal.
They believe the dinosaur, when he died, ran into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the seabed.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans likely spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with conserved scalp skin, but is also preserved in three dimensions and retains the animal's original shape," Brown said.
'the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the early chalk period.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it... if you just look a little with your eyes, you could almost believe he's on the sleep.'
The chalk period was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs passed through the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six-tonne monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta sank in the sea after death and was mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the world's best-preserved armored dinosaur, including skin and armor, and is complete from the muzzle to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 metres) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch long tips that raced from his shoulders.
Researchers believe the armored herbivores swamped through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial kept his armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilised remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy tank plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as' rare as a win in the Lotto.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.

In the thunderstorm: Mass carambolage on A8: Many injured
Violent accident Thursday night on the A8: Just over 30 vehicles are implicated in a mass caramage.
There are numerous casualties, miles of traffic jams - and gaffer.
On the Stuttgart-Munich (A8) motorway, about 20 people were injured late Thursday afternoon in a mass caramel attack.
According to initial police data, about 5 p.m. between the junctions of Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm, close to 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, were interconnected.
About the exact number of casualties, there were no details at first.
It was minor to mediocre injuries, a police spokesman said.
A large lineup of rescue vehicles was at the scene.
The A8 was completely closed towards Munich.
In driving direction Munich formed a 10 kilometre backlog.
As an AZ reporter reports, there were also massive disabilities on the opposite carriageway - through numerous gaffers.
The fire brigade listed the registration plates of the vehicle drivers, who are now facing sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 6: 45 p.m., a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There had been a collision between a car carrier and a passenger car.
A rescue helicopter was en route to the scene.
German Railway: Group tests' comfort check-in'
It's a moment almost everyone has seen before: Nothing unsuspecting sits in the train and sleeps.
Or you're deepened into his work and just have a brilliant thought.
And then: Pufff.
Comes the shear and awakens an unscathed or cracks the passenger in the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the days of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the flawless ticket control.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your place and thus devalue the ticket.
Currently, a test operation runs on two routes.
"When the offer comes, we extend it.
It is then expected to be available early next year on many more long-distance routes in Germany, "a rail spokesman said.
"Comfort check-in," the train calls the ticket devaluation without a sheen.
In order to be able to use them, however, some requirements must be met: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - which most passengers already do.
You must also have bought it via the train's app, DB Navigator, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway.
And finally, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: You get into the train, call your ticket under "My tickets."
In the case of test customers, a button for electronic devaluation appears.
Train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
Comes the train attendant in ticket control at No Y he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with already devalued online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, keep working, keep silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: One for the customer, one for the train - which in turn is intended to benefit passengers.
"If you want to travel without ticket control by our train escort staff, just check yourself in the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal, "says Michael Peterson, marketing executive of DB Ferntraffic.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."
Those who often train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are among the biggest nuisance.
Because often you yourself, but in any case one of the passengers, do not have all the documents you need in order to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or the identity card is missing or otherwise a document has to be presented.
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to poor mood in the absentee or wide space and delays in controlling your own ticket and, in the end, takes the Schaffner the time to take care of other concerns.
Still, only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And only on the links ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other delivery numbers on the same track are not yet unlocked.
How one activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to her core.
Just a day after she arrived in New York City, the one in St. Louis Geborene sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled across a post from someone from high school.
"Police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it is still on the road," they said.
Confused, as no one else on her feed had posted the information, she joined Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on her timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was in the process of tweeting live the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body that was outstretched on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She put off her mobile phone to return later in the evening to tweets about people on Canfield Drive.
There were photos of the police tape and people screaming, and of a man claiming to be Brown's father carrying a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another police officer defied his rifle and shouted, "I'm going to kill you... animals all."
"This is not common," Ferrell recalled of her statement.
'This is not the kind of murder we've become accustomed to and which we can call typical '.
At that moment, I felt chills.
I was angry and crying. ""
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11pm, she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would head to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whosis Streets?," in cinemas starting at 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a floral dress and a matching crown, the two discussed a conversation they had countless times before this morning "about the black experience and the black condition."
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" She recalled what she said.
'We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take them, "Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a highlight of... what happened in the past.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
It needs to be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to become free to free ourselves.
Even though I'm lucky enough to give her an experience where she personally doesn't experience blatant racism, she's no different from the next black woman's child.
I feel like I would do her a bad service to keep her away from it.'
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the Police Department that became a camp area as activists waited for the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to protesters.
Slowly, a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to take shape.
"My activism totally changed after August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities.
'i've had no experience in organizing.
It's all come.'
Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit?"
This skepticism was fuelled by countless cases of people, often whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview: "We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson didn't center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with then-co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around death row inmates.
His engagement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed by the team of "Whoe Streets?" In the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us... we talk," Davis said.
'that was the main thing for me about how these people are portrayed, because that's how I'm going to be portrayed.'
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement was "not a Messiah leader but a community coming together," Folayan said - it proved to be the film's most open participant.
As a result, documents from "Whosis Streets?" Show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," Ferrell said, and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
'but I understood that there has to be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people.'
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders, who coined the film "BlackLivesMatter" on social media after the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," Ferrell said, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything. "
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really sustained by black women and many black women."
However, she insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action" where Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film due to her identity.
"She was the person who was shaking up that energy," she said.
'it's no coincidence, although she was on the front line because in a life on these crossings as a black, gay woman, so much is at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen. ""
Meanwhile, news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on probation for 2 ¬Ω years for blocking a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A mess."
Yet she clings to a chant and she feels committed to that memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
'it's our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains. ""
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
"Not at the front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow caps on the same benches, spread in the room!"
"Very little space has remained owned by the city and we would like Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it was repaving the small street and setting up seats intended, among other things, for a cafe to which the company would like to rent space.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face recognition system, this' receptionist 'can see how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the key words of their entertainment.
From 'dream' to 'magnanimity': TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, although it is far from being built.
But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been dividing the population into advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold leaves the issue barely one.
Also on our Facebook page "People's Friends Bitburg" the issue is being discussed.
While some say to the bit gallery, "This would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "This would be real class" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "Don't need a man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).
While advocates rely on a gallery to draw more customers into the city, which also benefits the rest of the business, opponents fear that then the pedestrian zone will bleed out.
What's more, the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmers market hall is located, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
The start of the construction work will put an end to this.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and to Beda Square with possibility of sitting outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying almost weekly in the farm market hall for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of rural women always very happy.
Even the butcher we discovered for ourselves.
We would like there to be a chance, even during and especially after the construction of the gallery, to maintain this offer.
In other cities there are.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery comes down to the amount of rent.
But this is unlikely to be exactly low in the new project. "
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether it's clothing, shoes, drugmakers or supermarkets: I find that superfluous.
There is already enough of that in our city.
You can see how many shop shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, are largely offered directly by the producer and are also inexpensive.
As you can see, shop shops in a shopping centre are rented only by larger firms, because the rents there are often unsustainable for a retailer.
It is a pity that there is almost no more special business and that what is left of it will probably disappear. "
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall doesn't fit together for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit Bitburg.
In particular: Where should the farmers market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the ghost bit gallery manage to drive all business out of Bitburg? "
George Marquet: "It just won't work.
And a shopping center that is empty, no one needs either.
In my view, it would have been better to promote a proper farmers market, rather than this gallery.
But for a farmers' market hall, thanks to the insane many - I find - pointless construction projects in Bitburg, there is no longer a place.
If the farmers "market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A fitting resemblance: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptibly the same - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek tubs and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year sentence after she made public as classified diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance (A fitting resemblance).
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days left in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning, which created 30 portraits of what someone with these genomic data might look like, has created a sharp, if somewhat intellectual, commentary not only on the malleability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.
Through prison, her image was suppressed, so much so that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie in which Manning visibly sits unwell in a driver's seat and wears a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette dumplings and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to create a picture of what these people might look like.
That was the time she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail, and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal brides who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "suppressed images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who foresaw a future in which the president would convert Chelsea's judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would actually demand Manning's release just days after the book was published, after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is also something deep and strong now at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweeable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions he was supposed to fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."
In an artistic statement written on the gallery's wall, Manning, with her outsized signature among them (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart), called for an end to "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand-feet of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon) how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we all are.
"What people will hopefully take away from it is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data is to an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also seen.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of those stories." "
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novel.
It shows Manning as she emerges with a free-speech phone in hand from the United States' disciplinary barracks like King-Kong.
"If they cold your speech, then they won," it read.
"So never stop your mouth."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia.
'i still get goosebumps when I talk about it.'
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she were to do so, she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulacres, who are rallying together like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, to the size (5 "2, Manning's stature) where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
'i wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind their liberation.'
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford sought for killing
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who are being sought as a suspect after a man was stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.
On Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, according to the files of Cook County District Court.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.
A community warning system released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officers received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still pronounced dead at the site of what happened, and detectives are investigating the stitches as murder while police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an email statement that Lathem had now been assessed and barred from entering Northwestern University's campus.
"This is now a criminal matter being investigated by the relevant authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an email statement that "we are in contact with police in the UK and ready to help the U.S. investigating authorities in any way possible."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to face down.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he is urging the suspects to face authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received an enigmatic tip saying that something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also took place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza's management team released a statement to residents saying: "Police are currently working on the victim's timeline and background and are researching a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving something back to those who made sacrifices.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
Luc Chatel also defended education reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and unions) had called for Tuesday to protest against the project, which they believe is the victim of the educational training of future teachers.

Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) are implemented.
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard, "Mutko explained on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA's roadmap to comply with the code, which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list notes that Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Regarding the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation as our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we're not going to admit something that doesn't exist. ""
Mutko's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
Speaking to Russian sales site Rsport at the start of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but then added: "We have said repeatedly that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally, "Smirnov added.
RusADA was barred in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal by WADA from carrying out doping checks in Russia.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the organisation's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA was moving "in the right direction" to be reinstated.
In groups, new qualifications were acquired through the production and sale of handmade cards and then visited other companies.
When you enter the Expo 98 site, you have to show a card that is only issued to workers who have shown that they are legally resident in the country and are registered with social security.
"Optical cards" can be easily connected to all computers and combined with cards of a different kind.
Roland Fastberg will take over the second part as he designs the applications for the cards.
There are different cards on the market, and the important thing is that we are talking about machine-readable cards here.
I have a functional card here and will hold it up once.
You could also add a magnetic strip on the map and would then have combined all three types of machine-readable cards in one card.
In some applications, it may be important that we can actually combine different technologies in one map today.
Every now and then there are special offers from manufacturers and retailers offering two mattresses for the price of one.

"The then price-quality relationship annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it," says Luk√°≈° Pytloun.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive across the Czech Republic, prices for district heating vary from city to city.
However, the price in Prague remains among the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewage charges are expected to rise by 7.4 per cent.
(If not otherwise stated, all prices are from Toys "R" Us.)
Still, he foresees a slump in interest-rate spreads that banks are trying to offset with increases in fees and prices for loans.
Even if he assumes that the war over liabilities - which punishes interest-rate margins - will abate, the risk premiums that banks and savings banks will have to pay for their emissions to maintain liquidity will already be shifted to the price of credit as compensation for diminishing profit margins.
"They would like to go out, but they pay close attention to prices," he insists.
The deal will go well at those who "offer quality at good prices with a good service," he adds, and reminds us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices are most in demand by ¬£25.
"If you make a tender and there are few applicants, your prices will soar."
"The thought, however, is that it is not the price that is crucial, but the expertise of the people," Laport reiterated.
After the higher price of the products, this is the second brake identified by the barometer.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
On Tuesday, at least, the gap with German interest rates would have reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of contracts to cover bankruptcy risk had risen to 263 points, causing some headlessness in Rome.

Stresses that the International Atomic Energy Agency must be able to verify and ensure that the nuclear installations of the Contracting States of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons are used solely for peaceful purposes, and calls on the States to cooperate fully and without delay with the organisation to address problems related to the fulfilment of their respective obligations to the organisation;

During the negotiations on such an agreement, the states should voluntarily implement a temporary moratorium on the construction of further enrichment or reprocessing facilities, without giving up the right to the construction of such facilities, as enshrined in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and the obligation to comply with the moratorium should be subject to a guarantee of the supply of fissile material at market prices by current suppliers.
The scientific breakthroughs in biotechnology and the widespread existence of plants that can produce biological agents limit the prospects of eliminating biological weapons and make verification more difficult.
During the negotiations on such an agreement, the states should voluntarily implement a temporary moratorium on the construction of other such facilities without giving up the right to build enrichment or reprocessing facilities provided for in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and the obligation to comply with the moratorium should be subject to a guarantee of the supply of fissile material at market prices by current suppliers.

Aldi is not selling eggs for now
That's what the corporate groups shared.
It was a purely precautionary measure, it could be further from no health impairment, the statement said.
From now on, only eggs are likely to be delivered to Aldi, which has been demonstrably tested negative for fipronilous anti-noise agents.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency among its customers.
If we do not have an urgent debate, this matter will follow the end of the queue of motions for resolutions for the political committee, as happened with the resolution on Pakistan, which has not yet been discussed by that committee after three months.
Every minute of the working day, another five people are added to the queue for unemployment benefits.
The fact that the fine-sounding concept of the common market does not mean much is demonstrated every day by the long queues of lorries at the internal borders of the EC.
In the United Kingdom, this distribution took place under degrading conditions, because pensioners had to queue, as they did in the 1930s, to get their free package of butter.
Logically, this causes inconvenience, because the queues of non-French travellers - quite contrary to the notion of "grandeur," which may well have inspired the officer who invented the system - are much longer than those of the nationals of the Member State to which the aforementioned airport belongs.
In addition, the veterinary service ensured that lorries transporting live animals or perishable food were processed outside the queue, that the animals were drinks and veterinary care and that the delays were kept as low as possible.
In fact, some are seriously hampered by blocked roads, and I myself was more than irritated when I had to wait in front of a military post in a long queue.
For example, voters standing in 1,000-foot queues were sent back home in the evening because there was no electric light.
With regard to the number of Members of Parliament, I have long seen queues waiting to be able to use their card.

Part of a carriageway that can be characterized by longitudinal markings and the wide enough ¬°st for a queue of motor vehicles, except motorcycles.
The carrying out of these checks requires drivers of commercial vehicles to carry out extensive documentation and wait in queues outside customs offices until they are on the line.
Every vacant job in Sunderland has 2,792 unemployed workers, and more than half of those leaving school in 1981 had not yet found work when early school leavers in 1982 were already queuing up.
This last point may seem superfluous today, but so soon after the "bad time" that lasted until the 1950s, every politician found the empty shelves in the bakeries, the food cards, and the long queues outside the grocery stores all too present.
In the United Kingdom, the practice is very different, in other words, there are both really personal conversations and the so-called 'cattle market', where teachers sit at tables in the school hall and parents queue to change a few short, more or less meaningless words with the teacher in question.
If adequate content is available, citizens would "prefer to work online 'rather than queue," Liikanen told CORDIS News.
At the end of 2000, however, the consumer, who wanted to pay in euros, often met cashiers who - not accustomed to it - had to consult their superiors in order to be able to handle the payment, while he himself took the impatient view of the customers waiting in the queue.
Hence the snake.
The motto of 'eGovernment' could be 'better to sit on the computer than to stand in line', because eGovernment services should indeed allow for the simple handling of public services via the Internet, so that we no longer have to queue up in office.
As a result, aircraft are often forced to fly a long detour to achieve their goal, or to "queue" for the use of the corridors.
The EU-funded project sculptor opens up new avenues for visiting the major European galleries and museums so that endless snakes and tired feet will soon be a thing of the past.
The clearance procedures must be streamlined and simplified so that long lorry queues no longer hinder border traffic between Kaliningrad and the neighbouring regions of Poland and Lithuania.
This leads to long queues on the winding coastal road leading into the village.
We are becoming increasingly aware of the loss of quality of life that we are suffering as a result of traffic congestion, waiting in queues and standing in front of closed shops, libraries and authorities.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, and a meeting had rejected it with reference to the forthcoming Israeli election.
And there are many reasons why he would struggle in a general election.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chances of winning the election; however, that figure is down from 78 percent last month.

The start-ups that will help your company not to become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure happiness among your employees at your e-commerce start-up, but the polls didn't work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.
"There's just never been consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.
She has called people from the outside for help.
A new breed of Human Resources start-ups is growing to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass C-Suite executives and directly contact the board of directors.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" Said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your staff think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can rehearse why.
Companies come to realize that you must remain at the forefront of workplace culture so that you don't become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion in value in 2020, according to financial engineering website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw increasing interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber case discredited.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send tailor-made "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and look at the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline with which employees can report bad behaviour.
And when the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the supervisory board.
"The court of public opinion has covered the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.
If a company is found to treat its employees badly or behave unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, worker fluctuation and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company's headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints from staff.
Now that the company is using Convercent, problems previously hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair internship - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience with employment," said Vitrano, who heads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies realised you couldn't prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge companies with recurring fees for using their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors who have both supported start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising total capital to $47 million.
Glittering secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
These investments come as little surprise, given the interconnected nature of business, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research showing that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just stakes.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel that belongs to their voices, and that the work you're doing is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase commitment and use of staff, it's no wonder you find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important.
But the data is useless if a company's administrators do not take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change does not come quickly enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, which has seen companies rely too much on collecting data.
"Because if you don't follow, employees will ask themselves," Have you really heard me?
Do you care?
And who you don't care about, why should I? '
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to take action the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, according to Errett.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated staff, she was helped by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, able to reorganize several teams within the company and add communications training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insights about employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better bond of workers in an industry known for high sales.
"If you're not required to create a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.
'and if you lose people, you lose customers too.
And if you lose customers, then you're going to lose businesses.

I know how soon youth is dwindling and beauty is dwindling when, in the cup that happiness offers us, even a droplet of shame, a whiff of conscience is ripped away; and I don't want victims, no grief, no destruction - that's not to my liking.
This sight of the suffering and sacrifice of another turned my senses away from the exclusive reflection of myself.
"Jane, I want you to be a brother - my sisters will be your sisters - without you making us the victim of your just claims."

It was a very grey day; a matter of sky that hung full of snow clouds wobbled across the landscape; then and when fell some snowflakes left on the hard-frozen trails and bushes and trees without melting.
Again I looked out; we drove past a church; I saw the low, wide tower looming against the sky, its bells proclaimed the quarter hour; then I also saw a narrow set of lights on a hill; it was a village or a hamlet.
Behind and above the mountain summit, the sky arch spread, deep blue as at dusk time; into the sky, a woman's breast image raged, painted in as soft and unspecified colors as I could only put together.
Under this sky and above that mountain summit, a fierce storm is blowing.
I love this day, I love this bleak sky; I love this calm, this silence, this torpor of the world in this frost.
In the kitchen, in the front chamber of the cellar master, in the hall of the servants, in the big entrance hall, - everywhere the same life; in the salons was only peace and quiet when the blue sky and the semi-cyonic sunshine of the splendid spring weather called the guests into the park.
It was a warm, left, but not a bright, hot summer evening; the grassy workers were busy all the way along; the sky, though not cloudless, promised good weather for the coming days; its bloom - where it was visible at all - was mild, and the clouds moved high and transparent.
I don't know if it was a beautiful, clear or a stormy rainy day; when I walked down the great path, I didn't look down to heaven, nor down to earth; my eyes were at my heart, and both were now with Mr. Rochester.
It seemed to say: ‚Ä∫ my splendid visions are probably wonderful, but I must not forget that they are completely absent. ‚Äπ In my brain I wear a rosy sky and a green, thriving Eden; but I know very well that there is a rough path out here in front of my feet, which I have to walk through, and that around me there are black thunderclouds that I have to resist.
But I didn't look to the sun emptied, nor to the smiling sky, nor down to the awakening nature.
I glanced to the sky emptied; he was clear; a friendly star sparkled just above the summit of the rock cliff.
Perfect beauty is a strong expression; but I do not take it back and do not justify it; trains as sweet as the temperate climate of Albion only ever meandered them; colors as red and lily white as they are under this cloudy sky, in these humid winds ever created and bloated, justify in this case the term: Perfect beauty.
I stared at the bald wall; she seemed to me like a sky that was nestled close with shining stars - and every single one of them meant I was lucky, a loo, a fact!
From the west, a fresh wind blew; he came from the hills and brought sweet scents of heist and binge; cloudless blue in the sky; the current, which was stirred by frequent spring rain, came brisk through the canyon, and bright, golden rays of the sun and sapphire-coloured inks of the firmament were reflected on its surface.
On the evenings of a day whose characteristic was trending skies, cold winds and uninterrupted fine, penetrating rain, I came to this house.
He raised his hand and opened the eyelids, set up as it seemed with great effort, looking up to the sky, then looked at the amphitheatre of the forest - but for him it was all emptiness and darkness.
I led him out of the wild, damp forest into the sunny fields; I described to him how juicy green they were; how refreshed the flowers and hedges after the rain soaked out, how sparkly blue the sky was.
Even now, he cannot see quite clearly; he cannot read or write much; but he finds the way without being led at hand; the sky is no longer a colourless area for him, the earth no longer an empty space.
"And just as I chose the tallest tree in the forest," the pigeon continued with a raised voice, "and just as I thought I was finally getting rid of them, they even have to wind down from the sky!
Alice laughed about it so loudly that she had to run back into the bush, fearing they would like to hear it, and when she looked out again, the fish paint continued, and the other sat on the floor at the door and looked stupid in the sky.
It wasn't quite finished yet; through the uncovered rooftop, you looked at the grey sky.
Meanwhile, the sky had become quite blue.
And when we get up to the cathedral without stopping at the thousand barbarians of all kinds - what started with the pretty little tower, which was based on the average point of the cross-vault, and which was as slim and bold as its neighbour, the (equally destroyed) tower of the holy chapel, but higher, sharper, taller and richer than the towers, broke into the sky?
Only here did this dome building appear to be the boldest, freest, most artful and zag-rich tower ever to see the sky through its broken cone.
This is obvious and listed in terms of our cold and rainy skies.
And by opening the cell's window, he pointed his finger at the mighty Notre-Damekirche, which, in the ornamental sky, lifted off the black outlines of its two towers, its stone surfaces, and its mighty roof back, and resembled a tremendous, two-headed sphinx that had settled in the middle of the city.
In addition to the bed was a window whose shattered bleaching windows, which resembled a spider network torn apart by the rain, saw through their broken circuits a piece of sky and the moon resting in the distance on a down pillow of tender clouds.
During this passionate declaration of love, the Gypsy woman sent to the dirty ceiling that represented the sky here, a look full of heavenly happiness emptied.
We would flee... I would help you escape... we would go anywhere, we would look for the place on Earth where the sun shines the brightest, the trees the most beautiful green, the sky is the most blue.
One morning, while the maisonne emported on one of these deep blue skies, as Garofolo loves to paint his crucifixions on it, the buffoon in the Rolandsthurme heard a noise of car wheels, horses and iron equipment on the Gr√®veplatze.
It would be just as rewarding as if you wanted to know the name of every cloud in the sky.
At his feet, some chickens pickled the bush, crooked the gold beetles in the sunshine; above his main, groups of sheepish clouds swept in the blue sky; on the horizon, the tower of the Abbey of Sanct-Victor broke the hilltop line with its slate obeliske; and the windmill on the hill Copeaux looked whipped up as the working wings turned.
The sky was blazing and so was the water of the river.
Here it was Claude, who stood upright, and the Obelisk, who lay; but since the river that reflected the sky increased the depth beneath him, the enormous foothills seemed as bold in the void as any coin tower, and the impression was the same.
The fa√ßade was shrouded in dark; in the background, the sky sparkled in the stellar light.
The air was cold, in the sky, clouds swept down, whose large, white waves poured one over the other while they crushed at the corners and represented the ice course of a river in winter.
She slowly came up to him, raising the glances to the sky.
The air, the sky, the morning, the evening, the moonlight, my good friends the country's strikers, the funny Stafford with the girls to study the beautiful monuments of Paris, to write three thick books, one against the bishop and his mills, and God knows what else?
To whom do you owe it that you breathe this air, see this heaven, that you can still idolize your Lerchenhead with Alberneit and Possen!
Over this flame you saw the tremendous towers with their two ascending and grinning fronts, one dark, the other very red, and one even larger in the tremendous shade they cast in the sky.
The front yard gleaned and threw a beam to the sky; the wooden blow lit on the platform still burned and lit up the city far away.
The sky was completely pure.
In the fog, the waters began to flow, the ice cover barged, and the scrolls set in motion; the gloomy, shattering rivers flowed faster, and, just on Sunday after Easter in the evening, the fog smashed, the dark vault disintegrated into white lamb wolves, the sky cleared, and then the right spring broke.
He stood and listened and soon glanced down to the humid, moody earth, soon after the attentive horned laska, soon after the sea of bald tree tops that spread in front of him at the foot of the hill, soon after the dark sky swept through by white cloud strips.
While they spoke like this, Laska pointed the ears, glanced up to the sky and then threw a prescient look at the two hunters.
She immediately pulled him into a conversation with the real French exuberance of amiability, primed him happily because he has such a very dear daughter, and elevated Kitty straight into the sky by calling her, though she dabbled, a true treasure, a pearl, an angel of comfort.
He glanced up after the sky while his mustard was woven.
I have only just looked up to heaven, and there was nothing in him but two white stripes.

The NCAA eliminates two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It goes to 11pm when a lot of UCLA Footy players are chatting on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have pulled out their jersey parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes represent a lunch break.
Players enrolled to the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center the next morning at 6: 30 a.m.
"This is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA is eliminating two-day exercises to ease the burden of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.
That's why UCLA's first three trainings should begin at 7: 15 p.m. to meet the players' already fully packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of camp almost a week after last season and underwent practical exercises during summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 exercises during August. 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supports the NCAA's rule change, even if it adds another point to the players "busy routes.
"We put this enormous burden three or four days on them, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
'and they just pushed it through, they continue to placate, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it's going to be really great.'
UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished, which will be no easy task, given the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a high-class hotel that has already been pelted with footballs that cleared a safety net behind a goalpost.
Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted there could be a problem once those rooms are free during the season.
"We're going to use our security," Mora said.
'that's a real problem, and it's not far-fetched to think that people are renting a room there and then adjusting there to record an exercise.
If you have the video tape of an exercise, it's a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking lot 8.
We will do the best with what we have.
That is why I am not too concerned.
We have a plan. ""
He explained that it was "well possible" that Francis would ask the Cardinals for advice.
There was a need for further supplies of medicines, tents, blankets and the like to be made available.
Through an airlift, tents, blankets and medication were dispatched that arrived there within 15 days of our decision.
As you know, they refuse to wear detainee clothes, and only live in a blanket.
These aid funds were used to buy medicines, blankets, tents and food.
The concrete measures to be implemented in the coming days and weeks in favour of the population affected by the conflict are the distribution of 701 800 family packages, 180 000 sanitary packages, 300 000 blankets, 69 412 tonnes of food, the implementation of medical programmes worth ECU 13.5 million and accommodation programmes worth ECU 1 million.
They cover them with a blanket in winter and believe that this is enough...
Community aid consists of food, medicines and blankets.
Medicines, staple foods, blankets and clothing are needed to improve people's terrible situation.
For three years, the institutions have been content, first with the Community and then the Union, to count the points and the victims, to describe the devastation and to identify the shifts in the front lines and displacement of the civilian population, and only to distribute food, blankets and medical supplies.
Oxfam (UK) ECU 1,250,000 (distribution of drinking water, blankets, kitchen utensils, hygiene products, shelters)
This aid, as far as I know, is being passed on in the usual way, particularly through non-governmental organisations and, above all, to the procurement of food, medicines, tents, blankets, water, sanitation and the like.
This will finance items such as blankets, tents, mobile kitchens and electric generators.
A detailed list of needs shows that there is an urgent need to provide shelter, food, blankets, kitchen appliances, medicines and chlorine.

This does not necessarily mean an integral standardisation of information collection systems in all Member States, but the adoption of a common standard in terms of definitions and methods; this need does not conflict with the need to retain a certain degree of flexibility in the definition of the ceiling, which must be applied specifically in each Member State and for any legislative provision.
The figures on textile fabrics, which in some countries are expelled in current metres and in other countries in gm, or the data on blankets given in some countries in pieces and in other countries in kg, make it impossible to evaluate a company's statistics for the internal market.
This aid is intended to distribute blankets and locally purchased food through Caritas-Peru and to finance the necessary repair work.
‚Ä¢ The population affected since June in China and, in particular, in the province of Hunan, sustained cloud-breaking rains and floods: ECU 180 000 to finance an emergency humanitarian aid programme (blankets, medicines, disinfectants and water purification tablets); management of aid through M√©decins sans fronti√®res - Belgium.
The ECU 105 million provided was able to finance 337 aid flights to transport large quantities of tents, blankets, shoes, food and medicinal products.
The general lack of medical infrastructure in the Occupied Territories gives ECHO the opportunity to supplement food aid by providing basic medical products, infant milk, tents and blankets.
At the end of 1993, ECHO decided on overwintering aid for these people and provided food aid, medical aid, blankets, drinking water and implemented a preventive programme against the outbreak of epidemics.

They discovered that certain human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and increasing emissions of pollutants from cars, airplanes, and ships, are altering the nature of the atmosphere, condensing the greenhouse-gas ceiling (1) that naturally surrounds the Earth and helps to prevent heat from evaporating.
They assume that an atmospheric ceiling from COS, which is more effective than CO2, would already have been enough to compensate for 30% of the energy not delivered by the sun.
By doing so, it had encouraged the emergence of life that destroys it, such as ozone (O3) ultraviolet radiation, but how can we explain Earth's acidification with such a blanket 2.5 billion years ago?
It's not a net, not a ceiling that's above everything.
Clothing and clothing accessories, blankets, household linen and goods for interior equipment (excluding goods of tariff numbers 58.01, 58.02 and 58.03), made of spinning materials, shoes and head coverings, made of fabrics of all kinds, all these apparently needed, in bulk loads, loose or in buns, sacks or similar packaging

The most serious thing about this case is that the court set aside a document sent by the Mexican government under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the court), describing the procedure carried out by Vitro under the Trade Conflict Act, pointing out that it had strictly complied with the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States bankruptcy law.
Facebook to intensify fact review in fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake messages to fact-checkers from third parties and then display their results under the original post, the world's largest online social network said Thursday. It's one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to detect potential false messages and send them to fact-checking officers who may display results of fact-checking from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe they also influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to May's presidential election, and Germany supports a plan to penalize social media networks if they fail to eliminate hateful posturing quickly, as they did before the September elections.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review will be launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to recognizing what stories are being challenged by fact-checking third parties, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "related article" and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news.
Creating a comic novel: A castle in the history of England
In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was featured in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of tumultuous history from his cosy seat in the BEWL River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says hurt.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'a Castle in England 'spans time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another, emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It's not Rhodes's first book based on an archive: He wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents at the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter so written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jakobins," he says.
'that's his thumb imprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because at the time you lit a fire because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if he himself were also involved.
Oh, I love archives! '
For someone so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for nearly four months ("To be honest: I've overvalued my welcome a little"), this seems all too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the castle's many treasures and curiosities, such as the mounted hymn heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape managers, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "whiskey and started writing."
Scotney's intimate story is relatively unknown as the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees just started taking care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, throw it on the attic. "
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empires, cards depicting who owned what: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a birch around which two families fought.
Guys, let's go all his gear! '
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse themselves in English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man leaving the newly built castle to join the farming uprising of 1381.
"There's a recording of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book titled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex,'" Rhodes says.
'the peasant uprising started in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected? '
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as' The Priest ', which tells the story of the Jesuit patron that the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', depicting the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney: "The Lords seemed to be pretty crooks, always making debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking guys, with a talent to advertise endorsements. "
After the end of his dedication at the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has put behind him a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elasmanmoki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with the damn life again."

Campaign launched: Over 300 year old Mary chapel shrouded in Rh√∂ndorf
With the cover-up of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rh√∂ndorf, the city of Bad Honnef on Friday launched its campaign to introduce a new rooftop brand (round show from Thursday).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August, as the highlight of the campaign, there should be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth.
"Too nice for us.

'but we're using this measure to attract your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems.
Basically, we firmly believe that, as Bad Honnefer citizens, we are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city. "
The action is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it said.
"We need to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city a distinctive unique feature."

The device itself is within sufficient distance to the bathtub (direction ceiling), but the remote control is attached to a cable.
We sometimes say that a glass ceiling prevents us from doing so.
There is a clear vertical separation of the sexes (the "glass ceiling") in the scientific disciplines in higher education.
These findings show that considerations of how to encourage women to remain in scientific professions and the existence of the 'glass ceiling' in higher education should be given greater prominence in politics than in the past.
Where raw materials and primary packaging material, intermediate products or bulkware are exposed to the environment, the interior surfaces (walls, floors, ceilings) should be smooth and free of cracks and joints.
Cover and walls should be firm and have a smooth, opaque and easily washable surface.
These dinger there in the ceiling are smoke alarms.
A red emergency leash (stretching from the ceiling to the floor) or bell (say, at ground level) should be present if a disabled guest has fallen and needs help.
The assessment of the point of sale takes into account in particular the facade as well as the interior equipment such as flooring, type of walls, ceilings, the furniture as well as the sales area and the establishment of the cabins for cosmetic treatment.
In Austria, the ministry responsible launched a whole series of measures to get through the so-called 'glass ceiling', such as grants for women, financial support for publications, childcare services at universities and coordination centres for women's and genders research.
The issue of the unequal treatment of women and men in the labour market, including vertical segregation (glass ceiling), and the gender pay gap, which is at the heart of the Community programmes mentioned in Article 9 (2), can be addressed in the programme to the extent that it aims to ensure an integrated approach to the various areas covered by it or to the types of measures not covered by Article 9.
He set the elevator in motion and was crushed by the cabin on the ceiling of the elevator box.
The extension of equal opportunities to all members of society is a priority area of action for the period 2005-2010, which will also include further measures to address various problems, such as the gender pay gap, the participation of women in the labour market, vocational training, overcoming the 'glass ceiling', participation in decision-making processes and the reconciliation of work and private life for women as well as for men.
Gender differences in remuneration, greater participation of women in the labour market, the 'glass ceiling', reconciliation of professional and family life and participation in the decision-making process - these are just some of the gender equality issues where further progress is needed.
Figure 3.6 Porous materials can be used to dampen high-frequency sound on the walls of the workshop or hung to the ceiling as baffles.
Sound absorbing material can be attached in different ways: Hanging of baffles (left) (creating a large absorption area), complete or partial dressing of walls and ceiling (right).
The "glass ceiling" still ensures that few women rise in decision-making positions.
Add to that the so-called "glass ceiling" - the invisible barrier that keeps women away from the better-paid positions in management.
But, while social policy more or less promotes women's participation in the labor market, corporate models - traditionally developed by men - form the pillars that ensure that the so-called "glass ceiling" remains firmly anchored and impenetrable for women.

The funeral procession moved past the Holy Site, where just days earlier a construction crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then onto the bedside.
Shut their door, and put their keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but tack their possessions on the ceiling no more than twice.
Department to refurbish track for racetrack shuttle
Time and again over the past few months, there has been controversy over the future of the racetrack shuttle - now let's go quite quickly.
Even before the end of the year, it is expected to be built on the marauding track on which the tourist train runs.
To secure the future of the racetrack shuttle in the long term, according to the Department of Transport, construction work is expected to begin on the track later this year.
"With the decision to continue ordering and rehabilitating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this link, which is particularly important for tourism," transport secretary Klaus S√ºhl declared in Erfurt on Friday.
The cost of repairing the track put it at about $2.5 million.
Of that amount, the country takes 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle will also be ordered by the country in the future, is currently being finally voted on, S√ºhl explained.
The ministry and South Thuringia Railway as operators already agree on the technical details.
"As a result, the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," S√ºhl said.
The proposed contract between the ministry and the rail company will be concluded for a period of 11 years.
This should allow the race steep shuttle to be ordered regulars on December 2017.
The racetrack shuttle is a particularly popular railway connection between the Ilmenau railway stations and the racing platform.
In recent months, in the wake of a pilot operation, it has been tested whether the track will be used by sufficiently many people to order it back regulars in the future.
The track is also heavily decrepit in parts.

It's proven that, despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a far more far-reaching election in 2012.
"An inferiority complex that is almost inherent to Canadians may make Canadian political leaders much more likely to talk about domestic issues of everyday life than to pass the buck to the United States in this election (as in the 1988 free-trade campaign)," he describes.

The entire election could be annulled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
Madam President, there are new victims of ETA, but there are also new victims of Spanish oppression: New arrests, new torture, the relocation of prisoners imprisoned in the Basque Country.
Firstly, it concerns the method; it is a feeble and opaque procedure which, in reality, excludes the other institutions of the Union and in which governments fall victim to their own labyrinth.
Many victims are small children, awful impressions, terrible mutilations that destroy way of life before he started properly.
We must ensure that those who have become innocent victims of the fight against crime - perhaps we should call this collateral damage - are not completely isolated from their relatives in prisons.
However, in the face of this crisis, we must guarantee both health protection and food safety for consumers and the income of livestock farmers, as well as the income of butchers, Kalda traders and wholesalers, all of whom have been victims of the negligence of national and Community authorities.
Appropriate measures must be taken to ensure the following rights for the victims of crime: The right to submit and obtain information; the guarantee of communication; participation in the procedure and access to free legal aid; adequate protection of the person and privacy; the right to criminal compensation and the possibility of dispute settlement through arbitration.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just when you thought it can't get even more crazy in 2017, comes a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yes, indeed.
Sex robots are a big thing at the moment.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, its form of nipples and the type of fingernail.
"People are making fun of them, but companies are delivering plenty of them, and we're going to get to see them much more often," Mr. Sharkey said in releasing his new report.
Modern sexpubs have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved through artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his beliefs, selecting everything from the robot's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more troubling as many robots possess the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern Sexpubs have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that's adapted to your personality as much as possible," shrugs True Companion's website.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods throughout the day - quite like real people!
She can be tired of being fixated on conversation or she can be "in the mood"! "
There are many troubling aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female traits, alluding to rape when you take a step on frigid (means here: Reclusive) Farrah, worry one the most.
On its website, True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?" The website says.
However, these sex robots aren't just a fetish or stop just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men, of course, won't keep sex robots, and while the FRR notes their rising popularity, they still remain provisionally on the verge of consumer culture.
But what's leaked from the peripheral zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these sophisticated sex robots are appearing at a time when the rights of women worldwide are under threat, when there is a president in the White House who has boasted of sexually assaulting women.
The most chilling aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphic images, the spare bodies and the outcast eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this doesn't feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, that they emulate the movement of a real body.
But, to the point, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots don't represent real women.
They can't separate from their companion or just walk away.
They have no mediation or background story, nothing that points to independence or anything that could disrupt the fantasy of total submission.
In other words, they are fake slaves.
Or, to put it in the 2017 speech: Service girl

While they love Le Mans, the "green hell" of the N√ºrburgring North loop, or Indianapolis, Monaco's GP course remains incomparable.
But whether that is enough to stop the Catholic Church's loss of membership in the long run, I doubt it - all the more so because many bishops and cardinals in Brazil and other countries in Latin America are resisting the new course.
Only those in the company's training academy successfully complete a three-day course in which he learns the proper handling and application of Semco may also distribute this building material later.

The prize is to pay tribute to outstanding achievements.
In addition to the amount of money, the prize consists of an appearance with the Vienna Philharmonic at the Lucerne Festival.
But I don't think such prizes are groundbreaking for their own artistic development.
I would have evolved without these prizes artistically, aesthetically little else.
For me, a prize is, first and foremost, a great recognition of how to get it in research only for important publications - with the difference that such an award, unlike a publication in specialist circles, shows that one's own work is also perceived and appreciated by people who are not part of one's own field.

While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he dined like the multi-million pound man of world he has become.
The cost could hit JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, and that could mean there are fewer extra jobs.
There is another task here that we will have to contend with for a long time to come, namely to make a person who is physically in a closed room believe that he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), moving platforms and large bullets.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters deserve more space, and so they are far from alone in the film.
While there is a lift that runs through the middle of the mountain massively, the true space and reading delights open up at the foot-breaking clicking of topography.
"Normally the bookshelves stand along the facade, and in the middle lies a large, dark space that is mostly awkward and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
There is, however, a risk that he would face physical and psychological harm because he was trapped in a tight room and could not perform physical exercises outdoors.
They make significant personal sacrifices and sometimes take great risks to their own physical safety and mental health.
The members of the Security Council expressed their appreciation to the ECOWAS countries for the enormous sacrifices they have made and for their contribution to the cause of peace and stability in Sierra Leone, and called on the members of ECOWAS to continue to support the peacekeeping efforts in Sierra Leone.
Your victim will not be in vain.
This time, we debated with Director Alena (not a single man takes part in the course) how to attract a woman who does not have an ideally proportioned figure.
The course will be developed and offered by interested governments, international organisations and institutions with the necessary expertise and facilities.
As the example of the recently returned peacekeeping forces to Haiti teaches us, the United Nations must remain on track if the fragile peace that prevails at the beginning of a peacekeeping mission is to be consolidated and made irreversible.
This action plan builds on the progress made over the last 60 years in the field of human rights and sets a course for strengthening the OHCHR in such a way that it can meet the compelling needs of human rights in today's world.
Even where the course is clear, nothing will happen if there are significant capacity deficits - that is, if there is a shortage of human, financial, or other resources.
It encourages the new government to pursue the course of stability and national reconciliation and to promote social harmony.
Bearing in mind the experience in Haiti, the Central African Republic, Guinea-Bissau and Timor-Leste, I urge the Member States not to stop prematurely on the path to peace and peace missions of the United Nations.
The Security Council therefore praises the course followed by the democratically elected government of Lebanon and the Lebanese armed forces in exercising their respective responsibilities in the period leading up to the holding of the presidential election.
Trump's Great Performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. electorate have also divided families in small format.
Around Christmas and Harvest, there were newspapers in the US with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump's choosing relatives.
We are all supposedly trying to burst our filter bubbles.
Less noticed has been Trump's power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and has long engaged with Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship with whom she had fought for decades because of politics, is suddenly and quite peculiar on the same page.
This is certainly a good thing around the dinner table, but it strikes me in another context that this also entails significant risks.
The left has been bolstered by Trump, but the distorting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the grisly possibility that one day his mobs will no longer repel us.
There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans, who suddenly seem to be the epitome of prudence when compared to his standards.
Today, I find myself afflicted by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's quaint version of madness - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax returns looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, are indeed a very mild crime.
If Trump goes, the next Republican nominee only needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousel of the New York Park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crispy and the animals twist to look over their own shoulders with fear - extremely sinister and the climactic music conveys this in an odd way.
So many clich√©s of a city disappoint: The views of tall buildings are getting old, the skylines are becoming too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city doesn't live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn't count - but a big roundabout in north London.
However, the Central Park carousel is still a strangely magical experience, as here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-year-olds can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have assessed the carousel I would have given him the full score, but luckily nobody asked about it.
On the other hand, this week in a mall, I was forced to assess my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street, it's the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the mall stood excruciatingly grinning while I tired of the experience of stretching her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius with chest pain moved from prison to hospital
Pistorius has left prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for treatment of cuts to his wrist, which he reportedly suffered to prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by prosecutors against a first homicide verdict.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cabin at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a late-night intruder who hid in the cabin.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against Pistorius's six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecutor's Office said it would appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he undercut women's contacts with the outside world.
The world market price for crude oil rose 52 percent this year - last month the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly $100.
In the Buda√∂rser trade triangle, the price of the usual "Napi" Christmas basket has also increased by 16% this year, but price increases of more than 1,000 HUF have been recorded in all hypermarkets.
With prices in food markets "davongaloped" last December, the tally has not been drastic in percentage terms, compared with the already high, earlier starting level.
Prices for Unicum and living fish remained close to last year's level, but sharply increased prices for putt breast fillets, nut and poppy.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to data from the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but at Auchan there were 1kg of breads for 139 Forints.
Also surprising here was the price of a two litre Coca-Cola deposit bottle of under 200 Forints, so the drink including deposit cost only 257 HUF.
Our calculations have revealed that Cora increased prices in the "Napi" shopping cart compared with Christmas prices by 15 last year, while Tesco and Auchan each increased by 18 per cent.
Compared to the two last Christmas seasons showed a catastrophic price increase, the price of daily consumer items in the hypermarkets has risen by more than 30 per cent in less than 20 months.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores are no longer looking at prices at all.
The price of this car is not exactly popular.
There is still uncertainty about the extent to which we can actually act on the market, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at the customer level.
Insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that if there is a higher risk of accidents, higher contributions are also due.
Cautious drivers can choose a fully-fledged cascade, so that the benefits of full insurance are covered, but offered at a low price.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises the price it must pay for natural gas, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
This subsequently led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, driving up prices sharply.
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
Prices overall rose 3.0 per cent year on year.
The draft is expected to be submitted to the General Assembly for adoption during the Millennium Summit, and the Heads of State or Government are invited to celebrate the first ever agreement against cross-border organised crime at a special signing ceremony organised by the Italian Government in Palermo in December, together with the United Nations.

Articles 1.2 j), k) and l) of the Staff Regulations contain the basic rules governing the issue of the adoption of badges of honour, orders, benefits, gifts or grants from posts outside the organisation (see standards of conduct of 2001, paragraphs 46 and 47).
The old Article 1.6 regulated this issue in a provision prohibiting the adoption of any benefits from a government and severely restricting the adoption of benefits from non-governmental bodies.
With the wording of Article 1.2 (j) that he proposed, the Secretary-General wanted to express his view that the General Assembly should insist on the importance of the impression of the strict independence and impartiality of staff, thereby reaffirming the absolute ban on the adoption of the benefits of governments.
The Secretary-General will inform all Member States in writing of this principle of organisation on the issue of the acceptance of badges, orders, perks, gifts or grants, so that such incidents can be avoided if possible.
This consent will only be granted in exceptional cases and only if the adoption is not incompatible with the interests of the organisation and with the position of the official as an international official.
In accepting such gifts, there is little risk of undermining the integrity or independence of employees.
According to provision 101.2 m) of the Staff Regulations, the Secretary-General may, for once, authorise a civil servant to accept honorary marks, orders, benefits, gifts or grants from a non-governmental body, which are not covered in provision 101.2 j) to l), provided that their adoption is in the interests of the United Nations and is not incompatible with the position of the official.

When farmer Arnold finds an odd egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the fourth-graders were released from fencing and Epfenhofen into the holidays and into secondary schools.
Three of the deprivation students will go to high school in the future, four to secondary school.
Schoolboy Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the townhouse Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday night.
As a symbol of school dismissal, the 29 students of the four classes led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young eagle who grows up in the chicken farm but is then released to freedom.
To do so, the mating char performed a musical titled "The Eagle in the chicken farm on."
Farmer Arnold found an odd egg, and let it roar out of his chickens.
Instead of a chicken kitchen, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken out of him smashed, the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and escaped.
Afterward, classes three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank showed a chicken dance.
The hens danced with the young gockles carrying cylinders to make the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said schoolteacher Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other juveniles (chicks), but is part of it.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His determination is to be free.
She wished every fourth-grader that he felt accepted in his new school.
It was followed by thanks to colleagues, former head teacher Michael M√ºller, who repeatedly jumps in on teaching shortages, and parents' representatives.
The kitchen time is now over, explained classroom teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She was very reluctant to release her students after two years of teaching, because it was a really great time.
Finally, she was able to rely on the fourth-graders.
To finish, all students had a song of summertime and holiday time.
In doing so, great joy broke out among the children.
For the new school year, eight first-graders are already registered.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians have been imprisoned for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television, said.
On the morning of August 1, in Sithonia, a group of illegally celebrating people were arrested by police, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day they were released while an investigation is currently ongoing.
The State Department told bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and are imposing significant fines on anyone found to stay in a place not intended for this purpose.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court can impose a fine.
First, because some young people don't take advantage of these cheap cards anyway, because they wouldn't listen to classical music at any cost.
But Bayern, in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams undefeated, did not want to be the next victim.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered as 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collapsed at Mecca's Grand Moshee.
The victim suffered a nasal injury and was bleeding heavily from his nose.
When his two friends rushed in and appeased the racket, he initially dropped off his victim.
A 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate missing since Saturday has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The last victim of this sting was a just-beginning affair that had been more promising for alleviating the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and might even have brought him some satisfaction.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death at the Greueltat in the classroom.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death at the Greueltat in the classroom.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now a part of my past.
Liberia is hardest hit by the virus, and here alone, the fever killed more than 600 people.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What those affected need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars in the emission classes Euro 5 and in part Euro 6.
Euro 4 diesel or worse are exempt.
Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the software updates negotiated are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have cheating software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofitting has been ordered by the powerhouse Federal Office (KBA).
How and from when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation over the next few months, but have not yet given a precise date.
Daimler has been told to write to anyone affected.
If an inspection is due anyway, it will be done within their framework.
How long are the total refurbishments likely to drag on?
"Hard to say," Smetanin suggests.
This depends on the commitment of manufacturers and on political pressure.
"For we have seen that car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the issue of the environment."
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
More time-consuming could be to get a date.
What do motorists who don't drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
Presumably foreign manufacturers would follow suit, according to Smetanin.
Is a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars looming?
The ACE fears this.
But it is precisely in the regions where driving bans are under threat.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale yet.
Despite advances in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of contracting it.
Given that the Egyptian people are being given an ultimatum with this recourse to a hasty vote: "Either you vote for my draft or I retain unlimited authority," the latter should supposedly end once the Constitution has been adopted.
Petrizki also lived in the camp with him.
Every few hours they took a bath, so it was high afternoon when they returned to the camp.
Everything in the camp was drenched, the fire extinguished; for they were reckless herders, like all their peers, and had no precautionary rules against the rain.
All means of getting hot and tired were applied conscientiously, and gradually all the Aussies flocked back to the camp, equipped with capable hunger and then the destruction of the good stuff began.
Ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first awards ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners doesn't want to come - in protest.
Ll Cool J (49) will become the first rapper to receive one of the most coveted awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced Thursday, this year, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) as well as choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are also among the scholars.
The awards will be handed over in early December.
Traditionally, U.S. President Donald Trump will host a reception and, along with his wife, Melania, will attend the ceremony.
The award winner Lear, announced with progressive TV series, has already announced that he will refrain from attending the gala.
The New York Times said: "This presidency has chosen to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even depriving them of the means - and that weighs me."
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her view.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Previous award winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
Our politicians do not understand science enough, and they rarely seek the advice of scientists and engineers when it comes to solving important problems.
Major U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintain close ties with the Iraqi oil ministry and have stood by with technical advice in recent years, have gone empty.
This year, she is a candidate for Chile's National Literature Prize, an award awarded by the government, the Department of Education and the National Council for Arts and Culture.
He is one of 16,000 Egyptians convicted by military courts since the Higher Council of Armed Forces became the de facto ruler of Egypt.
For a year now, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), the Egyptian Military Council, has been abusing Egyptian women in a despicable, though not irreparable, manner, sexually, physically and mentally.
The government was forced to establish a council to write a new constitution: A group of citizens - without politicians, lawyers, or university professors - that made the discussion process accessible to all and managed to draft a preliminary proposal by consensus.
In any case, we can already start analysing the list of candidates, draw some conclusions about them and also make forecasts as to who will get a seat in the Council.
At the present time, there are 142 registered candidates for the 45 seats on the council.
Although there has always been a gender imbalance in the protest movement, the list of candidates is reaching a new level of imbalance for the Council.
While some opponents criticized the voting process and the results, many (if not most) members of the protest movement welcomed the council as a triumph of cooperation and mobilization.
In the near and distant future, the Council will certainly continue to take a position on similarly sensitive issues.
Both Ethiopia and the Council have good constitutions.
Based on the assumption that social stability and peace are conducive to economic activity, a series of dialogues were held under the Pact in 2001 on the role of companies in zones of armed conflict in order to find out how companies can increase people's security within their sphere of influence.
Declaring that any acceptance of the unlimited possession of nuclear weapons by the nuclear weapons states is incompatible with the integrity and sustainability of the nuclear non-proliferation regime, as well as with the broader objective of maintaining world peace and international security,
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Hasmon's city builder, retires next year.
The post has already been advertised - but suitable applicants are rare.
For 31 years, Wacker has been a city builder.
And the work still makes him great fun, as he conveys in the press briefing.
He reports on varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that so far no application meets the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.
So - while respecting the regular termination deadlines - there is still enough time for a review.
Since Haslach acts as the Lower Construction Law Authority for the Administrative Community, the Applicant must have appropriate qualifications.
Because that function definitely wants to keep the city.

Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and blurs, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are normally advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The lead researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling in the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in the food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of causing inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
If the balance tends too far toward inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments have found that a type of tolerance-enhancing immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their initiations.
And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a bacterial species - lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory Darmmilieus when the same system also swirls in humans.
Postdoctoral student Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was housed separately, did not have this.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the mice 'intestinal bioms - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The dyes of the mice were DNA sequenced and six bacterial species were found to be present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked a intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria had an impact on the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the fluid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells evolved into the tolerance-enhancing cells.
When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3 lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophane levels were halved, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-enhancing cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high tryptophane levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have committed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United have signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Chelsea's ¬£40 million signing began with a 2-1 win in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday, and impressed in the keeper's role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched forward at will.
However, Matic was excluded from the Blues' preparatory Asia tour and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later." "
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho formed his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted the club had already done a "fantastic job" of fulfilling three of his four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, I thank the club for that," he added.
'i'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've been making a big effort '.

New low for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem
As the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader, Social Democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections.
Just no troubling from the party headquarters, just no backlash from the federal government - that was the main desire of the campaign fighters.
Since Martin Schulz leads the party, that has changed fundamentally.
Since then, staff from the Willy-Brandt house have been watching with growing horror the events in the SPD-ruled state capitals.
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with headwinds.
It was lows.
And one after another.
The federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens after the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony.
"This shows once again: Reds simply cannot govern reliably," CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber told the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprise group exit of a Greens MP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the state election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and the Free Democratic Party.
Greens chief executive Michael Kellner has urged the breakaway lower-ranking Greens MP Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of the electorate's will.
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate, "the federal executive and campaign manager of the Greens told the editorial network Germany (RND).
"All of this may not be true at all," sighs an Obama campaign campaigner when the new hijacking message reaches party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is standing there after the transfer of Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU without his own government majority.
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD national associations.
And no one knows what comes next.
The malaise began with the unexpectedly significant defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no more, reassured the comrades at the time.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
It then became - and it all became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the thaw, the Dusseldorf bust hauling the party smoothly.
Painstakingly, the comrades rapped up again in the weeks after.
Then, when they had just created new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.

Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD leader, lost his Nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned.
And because, in crisis communication after that, he did pretty much everything you can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now also Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW exhaust affairs and his role on the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxon Prime Minister has been under criticism for a long time.
Miffed polls were added.
Still, or perhaps just because of that, Weil has been trying increasingly hard in recent weeks to put in the federal accent.
The former mayor of Hanover's quest to increase his power in Berlin was not hidden from comrades around Martin Schulz.
They allowed him to be granted, as they promised Weil a stabilization of the party.
Now the exact opposite may happen.
Weil is basically not to blame for the bipartisan duress of the Lower Saxon Greens.
And Schulz certainly didn't.
For the time being, the comrades are therefore trying to keep their own ranks closed.
Their anger is directed at the Greens, and here especially at the renegade parliamentarian Twesten.
"It's unbearable and democratic as Ms. Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else," Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the SPD general election group, told the editorial network Germany (RND).
Ms Twesten has been elected to parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate but via the national list of lower-ranking Greens, according to the lower-ranking MP.
The logical consequence would be for it to return its mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD general election group, laments an "undemocratic manoeuvre."
"The voter will four years ago was clear: People have made Stephan Weil the prime minister," Opperman, who leads the lower-level SPD as the front-runner in the general election, tells the RND.
"Now the personal career of a future CDU MP is distorting the election result," Opperman said.
He called for the background to be clarified.
I want to know whether there has been more or whether there have been further commitments from the CDU in Lower Saxony.

If, in a given year, one of the aforementioned ACP countries is unable to deliver the total set amount and does not wish to benefit from the measures mentioned in the following paragraph, the Commission can divide the lack of the total annual amount between the other ACP countries to which this arrangement applies.
The third paragraph regulates the application by the Commission.
However, the more important provision of Article 109j is contained in paragraph four:
It refers to a passage in the formal declaration of the Stuttgart European Council of June 1983 (paragraph 2.3.7th last paragraph):
At the end of the explanations, the following paragraph must be added:
However, paragraph 2 has a third paragraph with the following wording:
What does this third paragraph say?
The last paragraph of the amendment suggests that the work should be carried out mainly through research contracts and partly by the Commission's Biology Group in Ispra at the Joint Research Centre.
I would therefore ask you, Mr President, to put the first paragraph to the vote separately from the rest of the text.
Rule 14, paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 6 These paragraphs must be replaced by the following single paragraph:
The explanations must be changed by adding the following paragraph:
The change to this paragraph writes hot water showers during working hours
The explanatory statement on page 8 states in the very last paragraph:
So either a single amendment replaces everything - and that was the procedure to date - or it will be voted on individually on each paragraph.
However, it will amend this paragraph in such a way that it becomes clear that fares must cover the direct operating costs of the airline on the route in question and that state aid granted under Article 93 of the Treaty will be deducted from the costs of the airline, who can do so.
I would ask the Commissioner to confirm that the Commission intends to carry out the investigation mentioned in the second paragraph.
That is why I would ask everyone here to pay attention to the last paragraph of this motion for a resolution, in which we recommend a joint study, particularly by the Committee on Agriculture and Development, of all the new aspects arising from the introduction of new techniques and products in the sugar sector.
The last paragraph of Article 3 only takes up the right of initiative granted to the Commission by the Treaties.
There is a paragraph in this agreement which states that the Council of Ministers should agree to plug the budget gap in 1984 and 1985.
As regards respect for human rights in the Community, the Council recalls that, in ratifying the Treaties establishing the European Communities, the Member States approved the following paragraph of the preamble:
It attaches far too much importance to a subcommittee of the Senate, which does not really have any power, and does not sufficiently deepen the issue in the other paragraph.
In the French version, the expression 'from the European Parliament' was missing, which means that the paragraph, which has been discussed at great length in the Committee on Development and Cooperation, is losing all its meaning.
A paragraph in the resolution tabled by Mr Herman and his fellow Members, on the other hand, requires a remark on our part: We are surprised that the Commission's proposals are considered to be only in the short term.
We voted on the first paragraph of Rule 102 (a), but, as far as I remember, we did not actually vote on the second paragraph.
It is clear that the House has adopted the first paragraph.
Then this paragraph was voted out by a committee majority.
An amendment that I tabled and adopted by the majority of the House is noted in the Minutes as rejected and, finally, the recital of the original resolution was miraculously turned into a first paragraph of the main part.
In paragraph III of the last paragraph on the Committee on Budgets, the German text again contains the wrong translation.
This paragraph forgets that the Baltic countries are currently part of the Soviet Federation, that their authorities and their peoples know this very well, just as they also know that the rhythm of reform depends on that of democratisation in the USSR.
I refer here to Article 14, second paragraph.
However, when we analyse this article, we note that, according to its first paragraph, the Member States are endeavouring to promote the improvement of the working environment in particular.
Because of a misunderstanding, 16 members of my group voted against this paragraph and two abstained.
However, it is clear to me that this would not have had any effect on the final result, since the paragraph was rejected by a majority of 55 votes.
Can the Commission say whether, in accordance with paragraph of Recommendation 85 / 308 / EEC (x) on the social protection of voluntary aid workers, it has presented a report on progress in ensuring social protection?
You are no doubt aware that the first paragraph of Article 146 of the EEC Treaty in today's version reads: 'The Council is made up of representatives of the Member States.
Firstly, will the Commission accept this amendment, namely to abolish the second paragraph of Article 6?
Because, Mr President, in every paragraph she mentions the issues of the Kurdish question, the Cyprus problem, torture, freedom of the press and trade union freedoms in Turkey, and that means that there are problems.
Secondly, it is true that the first paragraph of Article J4 of the Maastricht Treaty reads: 'The common foreign and security policy covers all issues relating to the security of the European Union, including, in the longer term, the establishment of a common defence policy which could lead to a common defence in due course'.
I therefore hope that the Commissioner will consult with his colleagues over Christmas and ask them to pre-empt my paragraph in the resolution in the new year.
We started well this week in the European Parliament, as we discussed, among other things, the Barzanti report, in which the following paragraph summarises the opinion of many Members of Parliament.
That was in the paragraph.
However, if we look at Part II of the Protocol, we see that paragraph 1 is a de facto decision, consisting of three recitals and an explanatory paragraph.
Funding for town centre III
If you want to rehabilitate your old house, you can soon get support from the country.
About this, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives informed STEG Urban Development in sensibility on Wednesday.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler again gave a review of what has happened so far.
Since 1991, there have been in sensibility remedial areas.
At the time, in remedial area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg still took over two-thirds of the amount of funding.
In remedial area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60%.
For Schindler, previous gentrification is a "success project" - it is, after all, important to promote domestic development as well, and not just open up new construction areas.
On 4 April, the Karlsruhe County Council provided the information that there would be a remedial area III.
The funding amount was ¬£833 333, of which ¬£500m would come from the country, the rest from the community sensibility.
How, then, is a remedial area created?
One will, Schindler continued, investigate where the "really old" homes are.
But it also plays a role in whether there is any interest in rehabilitating in the planned area.
If necessary, the territorial borders could then shift again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday night.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-state program "Social City," under which gentrification would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of housing and work conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out in an object-related manner, that is to say per plot.
The remedial area would then eventually be established as a statute.
The eligibility period for the funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
Until September of this year, however, the inventory would be carried out in which those involved in the remediation area would be given a questionnaire to fill in.
In November or December, the decision on statutes is to be taken as far as possible, so that remediation can begin next year.
Pietzschmann subsequently explained that each commune had to carry out the aforementioned advance investigations.
It's about assessing urban abuses and deciding when to rehabilitate and to what extent.
For the respective property, a remedial note will also be entered in the basic book.
Pietzschmann will himself come back to sensibility and take a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of those involved.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until after the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land sheet," which deals, among other things, with the structural condition and restructuring intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and housing arch," details can be made about the size, distribution and residents of a living room.
The blue "operating arch" can only be filled out if business premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted, Gotzel pointed out, that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding.
Moreover, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler still stressed that the distribution of funding works according to the "greyhound principle" - who comes first, cautioned first.
You can't "reserve" funding for later.
At the end, still photos of the "town centre II" project were shown to make a refurbishment "palatable" to those present.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to get into house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be fitted with a microchip so he can open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and is now offering service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their lives using technology through his company BioTeq.
He has partnered with Dr Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dogs implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company also wants to change the locks on homes and cars so they are compatible with the chip, all for a surcharge of ¬£300 per castle.

The White House's advertising costs cost the taxpayer thousands
The White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military, which was left to TIME magazine.
The greenback Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was the centrepiece of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, made in Connecticut, was issued alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire engine from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order, or frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the helicopter's operation.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," the commander of the HMX-1 wrote on the eve of the event to his superiors, the deputy naval commander for aviation.
The news showed that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn at about 7am on July 17 for the event at 3pm, and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House were to be delayed, due to the restriction of service hours, a second team would be required for the return flight.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained on the ground at the plane during the time.
From the records provided to TIME, it was not clear whether ultimately a second flight crew was required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the provision.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds as if you're locked," the deputy commander replied.
The "Made in America" event was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave a push for health-care reform, which was underway in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for the trip.
But to request their use only for photo surgery is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane did taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of messages complaining about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
"The White House is thrilled by the show" Made In America "- which shows products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials," said the White House's deputy press secretary, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews frequently conduct training flights in the area around Washington and the South Lawn to dismiss the U.S. president in the White House with precise centimeters.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted in the flight crew's training needs for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said taxpayers did not take the burden for any of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the US Department of Defense's stunt tariffs for the 2017 financial year, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per hour of flight.
Records of the unit record the plane's flight time as 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility's home base in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
"Setting the cost to taxpayers on the basis of estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," Mr Walters said.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include staffing costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract completion.
At that time, the former White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, defended the helicopter's use for the event.
"The idea is to present this week things that are made in America," Spicer said.
'and I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this. "
It was not clear if Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he put himself in the driver's seat of a fire car.
At the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of them."

The commitment and influence of the European Community, and of the European Parliament in particular, in matters of world politics, are closely linked to our strong commitment to the protection of human rights.
I only hope that, after this report by Mr Michel, it will finally become clear to the public that it is not a question of promising more money that simply does not exist - as everyone who deals with budgetary matters knows - but of calling on individual people to take their own initiative, to make personal use of it.
Mr Michel was one of the most gracious Members of this House, mainly because of his spontaneous kindness, in which natural generosity and dedication to the poorest sections of the population were harmoniously combined.
The Community is called upon to continue and strengthen its efforts and efforts in order to ensure the success of this initiative, which is dutiful but still worthy of praise.
I particularly share the main points of Mr Kazazis' report, which I would like to thank for the acumen, competence and dedication with which he has carried out his task.
If discipline and compliance with Community standards are strengthened by active solidarity between Member States and by the use of professional fishermen, the common fisheries policy will no longer be an afterthought for a declining labour force, but an offensive by Europe to win the economic battle on the oceans.

All of this vastly exceeds the European stakes.
Our commitment and commitment remains unchanged.

Narco's Season 3 trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be brought to center stage in Netflix's hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos revealing Pablo Escobar's killer, Netflix's series is far from over.
Seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first receiving their first trailer and showing the show's latest villains.
With the third season, the DEA has turned its attention to the world's richest organization of drug trafficking: The Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful pats, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.

Role backwards: The city provides 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the kite lunch table again itself.
With fixed contact for the children and an assignment to the team.
In urban nurseries, the clock is turned back.
As of September 1, the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the urban day-care facilities (Kitchener) back into its own reign.
For Sonja Pommeranz, deputy director in the Department of Youth Aid, this is good news: "We've all been very pleased."
Cooked continues to be out of house: A caterer takes on this task and delivers fresh Gekocht chilled.
The city operates 46 nurseries in the Krefeld area, and in 44 the children get a warm meal at lunchtime.
In the past kite year, 2800 children each sat at the tables, and the need is growing steadily.
"Meanwhile, not only do children who are cared for 45 hours a week eat in the kita at noon," explains Pommerance.
"The offer also applies in the 35-hour care if children stay until 2pm."
46 part-time workers have kitchen service from September 1: They warm up the delivered food, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, portioning the meal individually, spending the meal, clearing, rinsing and cleaning the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a kita," Pommeranz says.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-tier facilities - decides the amount of hours.
"The kitchen helpers are now firmly part of the kite team," Pommeranz says satisfactorily.
'so they're much more involved and it's easier for the kital guide to implement pedagogical concepts.'
Because that's also what it's about: Healthy eating and cooking lessons.
"The children are supposed to help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
Even for the kids.
'They have a known force in kita, a person familiar to them, and not constantly changing people.'
This continuity is important for children.
The cleaning of the kite rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will in future be done by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has, in addition to improving the quality of kitchen performance, also the charm it has turned out to be the most economical in the cost comparison between self-government and foreign allocation for the city, the press office said.
And that's despite 46 part-time workers being rehired.
"But these hours don't fall so heavily in weight at around 750 people in the educational area," says Sonja Pommeranz.
In addition, like a number of other project critics, he fears that traffic would increase sharply by the intended size of the plant: "There must be whole bus loads coming in to make that count," according to Schulz

Moreover, the fact that the textile material remains visible around the leather and on the paragraph cannot exclude its classification as a feed.
Thirdly, the textile material visible around the leather and on the paragraph is apparently intended to ensure that the shoe is more comfortable to wear.

Afghan democracy depends on women's political role, says UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday.

The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3.6 million voters.

Men try to clean up 13-year-old girl
Two young men, aged 19 and 23, are believed to have tried to deprive a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police, the men spoke to the 13-year-old, who was staying with friends on Kolping Street, at around 2.55pm because they wanted to phone the girl's mobile phone.
However, the 13-year-old declined the request and went on with her friends.
As a result, one of the offenders tried to grab the girl's mobile phone and necklace, but that failed.
Without prey, the duo fled.
The two young men could later be arrested by police.

GMB concerns over investment at McVitie factory in Glasgow
A union would like to assure managers of Biskuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production at their plant in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company had remained silent about the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits alongside other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he had invested more than ¬£5 million in recent years.
He added that staff and union representatives would "be the first to find out" if their activities were to change.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland urged McVitie's to "voice concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be pushed forward."
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the general-site manager about the business needs and investment plans for Tollcross's future deeply affects our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is focusing heavily on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, pay and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving production presence at McVitie. "
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The store manager at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly to this as we appreciate the continued engagement with staff and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, during which some questions were openly discussed.
We discussed with the staff that, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our divisions and locations - to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years we have invested more than ¬£5 million in our Tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a production site. Should our operating processes change at the site, the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know this. "
'My uncle Reed is in heaven and can see everything you do and say; and my father and my mother too; they know that you lock me up all day and that you just wish I was dead.'
Only two or three days ago I buried a little child of five years - a good child whose soul is now in heaven.
"Let your light shine before the people that they see your good works and praise your father in heaven."
And then my soul made the first serious effort to comprehend what one had put into it in terms of heaven and hell; for the first time I looked around me and saw in front of me, next to me, nothing but an immeasurable abyss; for the first time, my soul was horrified back, she felt and felt nothing secure more than the one point on which she stood - the present, nothing but an unfathomable cloud.
"So you are sure, Helen, that there is something called heaven; and that our souls will go there when we die?"
‚Ä∫ Shoot him to the fourth finger of my left hand and I belong to you and you belong to me; and we will leave this earth and seek our heaven over there. ‚Äπ
She was close, and as I sent no request to heaven to avert her from me - as I had not folded my hands, bowed her knee or moved her lips - she came: In big heavy woes, the electricity brewed over me.
The enclosure I could defeat, but the inmate would fly to heaven before I could still call myself owner of that shell of earthly tone.
No doubt St John would have given the world that he would have been able to follow her, call her back, hold back if she left him like that; but he did not want to give up an atom of his aspiration to heaven; he did not want to give the Elysium of her love a single hope of true, eternal paradise.
But then she raised her old piano song: "Oh, why did heaven so want it?
He regretted him, but then he declared that in some relationship the sick must rejoice, for it is the Lord's will that gives him the opportunity to reconcile with heaven.
Hands folded, raised her head and looked to the sky emptied.
Thanks to heaven, he had happily survived this journey and had arrived in Rome without accident.
It's heaven. ""
Behold, on a sign coming from heaven, because the sun exists, these thousand churches are buried at once.
This young, paternal and motherless brother, this little child who suddenly fell from the sky into his arms, made a new man out of him.
At the points where these currents cut in the sky, they create the light; at their cutting points on Earth they produce the gold...
The creature that stood before my eyes possessed that superhuman beauty that can only come from heaven or from hell.
She addressed her roasted and dry eyes to the sky, to the sun, to the silver clouds emptied here and there by deep blue triangles and trapezes; then she smashed them down, glancing around, to the earth, to the crowd, to the houses over... Plaid, while the yellow man tied the elbows together, she encountered a dreadful horror, a joy cry.
It is one of the wise, dignified death that has persisted throughout his life: A death that is not meat and not fish, like the spirit of the real sceptic, a death that expresses quite the doubt and inconsistency that holds the middle between heaven and earth that keeps one in limbo.
The beggars shouted, chastised, cursed, and soared; and Quasimodo, feeling powerless against so many enemies, trembled for the gypsy woman, and saw the angry faces increasingly approaching his gallery, asked the sky for a miracle and rang her hands with despair.
You will find it in heaven. "
As for Quasimodo, who had not stopped fighting for a moment, when he saw this wild escape, he fell on both knees and raised his hands to heaven; then he drowned with joy, and rose with the speed of a bird to the cell whose entrances he had defended so unashamedly.
At times, with bewilderment, he looked at a kind of narrow plate, made ten feet deeper by the indulgences of the Steineraths, and asked the heavens, in essence, of his frightened heart, that he might be able to decide his life on this two-foot-in-a-row space: Should it take a hundred years.
We greeted together about such works as ‚Ä∫ Ververt et Chartreuse ‚Äπ of Grasset, ‚Ä∫ Belphegor ‚Äπ of Macchiavelli, ‚Ä∫ Heaven and Hell ‚Äπ of Swedenborg, ‚Ä∫ The underground voyage of Nicolaus Klimm ‚Äπ of Holberg, the Chiromantie of Robert Flud, of Jean d'Indagin√© and of de la Chambre; roared over the ‚Ä∫ journey to the Blue ‚Äπ.
In Him alone we find peace and comfort and salvation and love, "she said, and began to line eyes to heaven, praying as Alexei Alexandrovich shut out of her silence.
Of these, he knew none except Henoch, who was stripped alive into the sky.
Shortly before, he had known all the names; but now he had forgotten them entirely, notably because Henoch was his favorite figure from all over the Old Testament and, in his head to the Rapture of the Living Enoch in the Sky, joined a whole long series of thoughts, which he left behind even now, while he turned his eyes to his father's watch chain and to a only half-cracked button on the West.
The agonizing state of waiting that she, floating between heaven and earth, went through in Moscow, Alexei Alexandrovich's slowness and indecision, her unification, everything she put on him.
A heavy thunderbolt came rolling and pollinating from the sky and lost in the distance in dull grooming.
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar three years ago?
La Liga's side may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after it made an offer of ¬£189 million to trigger its release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world record assault three years ago?
The sensational approach has fuelled the transfer window in the summer, as the Ligue 1 club is poised to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for ¬£89 million last season.
After the termination, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona are furious at the way Neymar has forced his way outside, although a source close to the Catalan board insists the club has always done its best to take care of him since arriving from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president about this prospect?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not concerned because they know that if they touch one of our players then we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to have one of our players signed with them, it will have consequences. "
Barcelona appear to have crossed that line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to depart under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of that interest by losing one of their price offers for Neymar.

A course entitled "Racism and Xenophobia in the Workplace" has been offered for three groups of employees of the district administration.
This course was addressed to staff with supervisory functions, to workers of foreign origin and to teachers of the School of Care professions.
The course should create a positive working environment and help prevent 'cultural collisions', ensure that staff know more about each other, provide more information about the political parties' agreements on immigration and refugee issues and encourage them to work within the framework of local action programmes.
This course addressed prejudice and hostile attitudes as a result of ignorance and provided an opportunity for practice-oriented discussions on xenophobia and racism, thereby achieving a long-term change in attitudes.
Another initiative is a course at LO schools on "Introduction to the Danish Trade Union Movement," which aims to encourage ethnic minorities to use trade unions for themselves.
This course addressed prejudice and hostile attitudes as a result of ignorance, and it provided an opportunity for practical discussions on xenophobia and racism, which should bring about a change in attitudes in the long term.

This shows, Madam President, that the resounding regime, which is supported by the military in the Grande, is taking a hard line against dissent, for which we, all 12 Member States of the European Union, share responsibility, because, although Parliament has raised the alarm on several occasions, it is not only human rights that are being violated, but also fundamental democratic principles.
I fully support the line taken by my colleague, according to which Parliament's codecision under Article 129d is required for both proposals.

As the Council's deliberations have not yet been completed, it is not in a position at this stage to comment on the course it intends to take on this matter.
Now the President can follow the course he has taken freely and, as I understand it, lead his team in the search for a middle way.
I would just like to say briefly that this morning, at my suggestion, the Commission adopted an interesting communication on this subject, which, on the one hand, of course maintains the budgetary approach but, at the same time, identifies a number of new possibilities to which Europe should resort.
Germany has spared no effort and no sacrifices to achieve this objective, and you will understand, Mr President, that I include Chancellor Kohl in my recognition, who has been as courageous as he has been resolute in following this course.
That is why this report is addressed to all the European institutions, but it is, above all, justified as an internal discussion paper of our Parliament, because it is intended to set the most democratic course for our parliamentary route during 1999.
We are putting the Union on a new course of transparency and democracy in a citizens' Europe.
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburger SV becomes a table leader.
"We need the second goal," explained Hermann Rieger in the cabin aisle of Hamburg Arena.
His command will have been similar: Her with gate two!
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive goal in the ninth minute of the game.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a goal, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev converted a pass in that victory game, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparation games.
Kovalev scored the win by shooting the only goal of the whole shootout.
Humans, animals and goods were safely housed in the hostel yards - the gates were firmly closed for the night, the guardians also provided internal security and peace among the hostel's guests.
Because: In the seventh lunar month, many Chinese believe, the gates of the underworld and sky are bullion-wide open and the countless souls of the deceased make their journey back to Earth.
Its carbon-neutral energy is first used to build the city, which is expected to open its doors as early as the end of 2009.
If these banks were to close their doors abruptly, the Swiss economy would be in need.
Despite these constraints, the fact that the continent now counts 19 securities exchanges suggests that Africa has opened the door to foreign investors and businesses, and is gradually integrating into the global economy.
Betting fighters from 26 nations took part in the contest, which involved recreating the Brandenburg Gate and dressing it up with plates (tiles) - "too entangled," as Liebenauer says.
But this can also open the door to criticism.
Positions at General Motors Overseas Corporation with responsibility for European sales, marketing, planning and trade relations.
Background: The concept of tariff preferences is based on the recognition that it is particularly difficult for those countries whose industry is still under construction, that is to say the developing countries, to gain a foothold in the industrial markets and to increase their sales there.
Such a market structure entails internationalization, because national oligopolies, with a stable single market, look elsewhere to increase their sales.
Price reductions in the event of exceeding agreed sales figures: In France, automatic price reductions for products whose sales significantly exceed the sales figures indicated in the original price calculation application.
Uniform EC standards also give the European car industry an important competitive edge over lorry manufacturers outside the Community, because 57 countries are now adopting EC standards in their national legislation, because they have realised that they are also useful and workable for their countries; this promotes lorry sales and, at the same time, creates thousands of new jobs within the Community that we so desperately need, Mr Collins.
I think it is important to note that by the beginning of 1980 all the companies in the European car industry had gone through record years of sales and that the advance of Japanese competition had been foreseen for a long time, including by the car industry in Europe, which perhaps partly believed that things were still going so well without the need to make an effort.
It will exacerbate intra-European competition, because even the Member States of the Community, which have so far tried to protect themselves in a restrictive manner from Japanese competition, will very soon find that European suppliers will seek their way to the market of these countries in order to secure the sales of their cars, despite the increased Japanese imports.
In view of the increase in the supply of milk in the Community during 1982 and the corresponding increase in the production of butter, the Commission considers that two types of measures are needed in the short term, partly in order to ensure reasonable sales of butter stocks, partly in order to prevent too much growth in the butter mountain.
As you know, the Community has fallen considerably behind in this area over the last ten years, as demonstrated by its paragraph, which was already moderate at the time.
Both the subcommittee on technical barriers to trade and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs believe that the noise level of household appliances plays a role in the paragraph and that this problem is solved by competition, by market forces themselves, so that there is no need for legislation.
The Community's consumer organisations, like the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, have been tirelessly pointing out for years that only a move away from sales and price guarantees and a shift towards genuine structural policy can put the drift back on track.
With such action, this country could have artificially expanded its sales on the world market in 1985, which would undoubtedly have exacerbated the already difficult situation in this market.
I am prepared to think about such an abolition at a time when a level of production is reached that is justifiable for internal use and for sales.
Can the Commission say to what extent the sale of unleaded petrol has replaced sales of leaded petrol in each Member State of the Community?
Anything that serves to increase quality and improve marketing and sales should therefore be supported by us.
The European Parliament recently decided not to promote intervention measures in these products, but rather to promote market-oriented sales by improving the quality of supply.
Contrary to the hopes of all, but also to Norway's stated expectations, sales on the Japanese market did not increase in 1995, and there has even been a slight decline.
On the other hand, by means of a cautious export policy, the Commission is promoting the sales of the Community price on the internal market.
However, in view of the differing views of the Member States with regard to the promotion of sales on the internal market and, overall, the positions of the Member States on the sale or promotion of the sales of alcoholic beverages, I believe that we have a problem here which would make it very difficult to integrate into a common organisation of the market in wine.
This initiative is all the more correct given that we already have assessments of the campaigns to promote the sales of olive oil and fibre - as Mr Fantuzzi also pointed out - whose sales in third countries have increased thanks to the promotion of ad hoc instruments.
In this context, I would like to stress that I consider the desire for increased sales mentioned in the Fantuzzi report to be positive.
It is necessary for the EU to pursue an active export policy which goes beyond the use of export refunds and which, in addition to the export refunds already in place, can have a positive effect on the sale of agricultural products.
In the Community, the sale of starch and its derivatives is supported by production aid if these products are used in sectors that are not subject to import protection, such as the chemical, pharmaceutical and paper industries.
The concept of tariff preferences is based on the recognition that it is particularly difficult for the countries whose industry is still under construction, that is to say the developing countries, to increase their sales on the markets of the industrialised countries.
The Community considers that this system was at least partly the cause of the very sharp decline in Community motor vehicle exports to Greece recently, while the suppliers of certain third countries have been able to maintain or even increase their sales.
- to facilitate the sale of the quantities of agricultural products not covered by framework agreements on the world market.
(14) The impact on the Community industry concerned, in particular on those companies that produce a large share of non-market standard goods, was particularly evident in a fall in production, in sales and market losses, and in a significant fall in prices, coupled with significant reductions in net revenues or rising losses.
- increased sales of raw materials from the ACP countries in the Eastern European countries;
The Commissioner, Mr CHEYSSCN, recalled that the alcohol market in the Community is undergoing a clearly declining trend, which is, of course, based on the sales of rum as well as other spirits on this market.
Their production and sales increased by 2% from 1981 to 1984.
Compare Community data on the production and sales of industrial products;
- compare Community data on the production and sales of industrial products; - assess domestic markets; - compare industries; - know the current situation and plan the future of these industries; - want to become better informed and more competitive.
In recent years, sales of natural gas have been divided up as follows:
The sales were distributed as follows (estimate 1984):
Sales to households in 1984, in turn, were distributed according to the following zones: KWh / year
In 1984 the paragraph on the public network was distributed as follows (preliminary results):
These associations, which are professional representatives subject to civil law, can, on the explicit condition that they do not distribute profits (not even in the form of reimbursements) to their members, serve the joint purchase or sharing of agricultural machinery, as well as the collective delivery of their members and the collective sale of their products.
Without neglecting the important aspect of the supply of raw materials, there was therefore an urgent need for a greater focus on sales and market problems.
The increased sales of motor vehicles in 1994 led to a slight recovery in the production of the rubber industry, although production has still not reached the 1992 level of value.
The fact that large companies are weakened, or even closed, also contributes to the vivid development of small businesses and their share of sales in France from 1980 to 1988 by 10%.
Sales of coal in the Community have decreased from 45 million tonnes to 40 million tonnes since 1990. The percentage declines in each country over this period have ranged from 3% (UK) to 17% (Luxembourg).
Sales of coal in the EU decreased by 1.8 million tonnes (4.4%) from 39.7 million tonnes in 1992 to 37.9 million tonnes in 1993.
In this respect, the beef shortage should have encouraged the sale of poultry meat, whose prices are relatively low and attractive to the consumer.
A decision under Article 86 required the United Brands Company to abandon the following abusive behaviour in the sale of Chiquita bananas within the common market: Closing the market as a result of the ban on the sale of green bananas; refusing to supply a banana-importing Danish tyre; differentiated sales policy, in which the Irish, German, Danish, Dutch and Belgian customers are each charged different prices; and applying unreasonable prices.
The most important measures introduced in 1972 for the sale of butter and skimmed milk powder surpluses have also continued this year; in particular, butter has been given to certain food industries and consumer groups.
However, the continuing poor economic situation in the second half of 1975 resulted in significant losses in the sales of coal and coke to thermal power plants and to the iron and steel industry.
The Joint Group of Experts, set up after President Jenkins' visit to Tokyo in October 1977, will continue to examine in detail the conditions for the access of Community products to the Japanese market in the sectors where sales could be increased.
On the other hand, the paragraph should also be secured.
(I) either the commissions usually paid or agreed upon for sales in the Community or the usual increases for profit and general costs (including the direct and indirect cost of sales) for imported goods of the same type or type;
The Community supports the financing of work that will help to increase production, reduce production prices or facilitate sales of products.
(I) either the commissions usually paid or agreed upon for sales in the Community or the usual increases for profit and general costs (including the direct and indirect cost of sales) for imported goods of the same type or type;
Tunisia's sales of industrial products focus heavily on clothing and, to a lesser extent, on spinning materials (more than 18% of all exports in 1979), partly due to the spectacular increase in "passive processing" that followed the investment of companies from Community countries, particularly from the Federal Republic.
This could even lead, as is already the case with northern products, to the Community squeezing out established exporters through subsidised sales on the world market.
Morocco, in particular, has been able to redistribute its sales from France and the Federal Republic to the Benelux countries and Scandinavia, and in particular the USSR and Saudi Arabia.
This solution should have the merit of entailing a less open commitment on the part of the Community than guarantees of income or guaranteed / sales on the Community markets themselves.
Since, in most of the cases mentioned, employment is at least as important as the effects on the balance of payments, it would be a better way to guarantee sales of reduced quantities, but at higher (possibly intra-Community) prices than before.
The ban on minimum prices does not apply to the sales of books, newspapers and magazines, or to goods and services subject to special legislation that enshrines minimum or fixed prices.
They are crucial frameworks for sales and development equalities for regional production and employment.
In the case of mineral raw materials such as copper, phosphate, iron ore, the ACP countries receive project aid when production and sales are at risk and export earnings are reduced as a result.
The overall concentration in the food production and processing sector is low, as measured by the paragraph.
Of course, this programme is not a patent recipe for European agriculture: In individual cases, however, it can help to open up new sales and income opportunities.
As long as the crisis persists, there are many accusations of protectionism on both sides, accused by lobbies who encounter obstacles to the sale of their products or who fear that their market will be inundated by products that no longer flow into the usual sales areas.
Dutch exports, which, to a considerable extent (almost 30% in 1983) consist of raw materials and pre-products, the sales of which are particularly responsive to economic development, could be stimulated, in particular, by the current stock formation.
This would be a considerable increase in quantity, bearing in mind that the forecasts for sales on the foreign markets in mid-1983 amounted to 440 billion m3.
In fact, it is likely that there will be little increase in demand for steel products, which will be reflected in a fairly slow increase in total exports, even though sales of new companies will develop dynamically.
While sales of natural gas abroad continued to decline relative to 1986, exports of manufactured goods grew relatively lively, despite the strong appreciation of the Gulden in 1986 and 1987.
With ministries still in control of commodity supplies and prices, and able to guarantee sales, most business leaders seem to have been more interested in a good relationship with the apparatus than in demanding their newfound entrepreneurial freedom.
Parliament must also be able to be represented on the management board of Europol and to participate in the election of the director of this body.
To an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese, police are appealing for witnesses.
Because he was confronted by a car on his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to evade while touching the guide.
On Thursday night, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was travelling with his VW at around 7.55pm on the B 215 from Stolzenau coming towards Leese.
In the area of Stolzenau's local bypass, he was confronted by a passenger on his lane so he had to evade to the right.
In doing so, the Touran driver touched down the guide.
On the car, property damage was caused.
The driver of the nearby car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the road accident.
It may be good, according to the accident victim, that the Mercedese driver had not even noticed the accident.
Police are now asking witnesses to the incident, as well as the driver of the polluter's vehicle, to contact the commissioner in Stolzenau on Tel 05761 / 92060.
A lack of storage and transport capacity, as well as organisational difficulties, mean that the manure must be 'disposed of' on land that is conveniently located in the countryside.
These bookstores exhibit the publications of EUR surgery in a storefront or part of a storefront reserved for this purpose and must have the most important publications of EUR surgery constantly in stock; they must also be connected to an online ordering system for the procurement of non-stock titles.
The decline in domestic consumption caused by economic crisis, the decline in the income of workers due to unemployment and high inflation, and the fall in exports of Greek wines, following accession to the EEC, have led to the creation of significant stocks in, for example, Crete, Santorin and other areas.
In addition to the 1980s harvest, there are now 115 000 tonnes from the 1980s harvest in stock that could not be withdrawn.
Only one of the speakers spoke of the possibility that his own garden could become a storage ground for radioactive waste.
We should be ashamed that we have huge amounts of milk and butter in stock, while in the Third World children are dying of hunger.
It can, of course, also reject it at this stage, but that would only mean a postponement, because it is certain that the day will come when the Council will be forced to reduce quotas and dissolve the camps.
However, the honourable Member's observation that 50 000 tonnes of last year's harvest is in stock is contradictory.
If we continue with our set-aside programme, we will soon have 18 million tonnes in stock.
The Commission claims that the stocks are too large, which is not true, because less than nine million tonnes of stocks, not even 6% of annual production, is not excessive, but let us put that aside.
After intervention purchases, we have 200 000 tonnes of butter in stock, not to mention East German stocks, and by the end of this year these stocks will grow to around 270 000 tonnes.
The war will come to an end, and the camp of the defeated and the victors will take stock.
There are 40 000 tonnes of salmon in stock which will soon be thrown into the world market.
According to press reports, an old truck ship has been deployed in the Saronic Gulf, which eight years ago was converted into a floating laboratory and a warehouse for the oil-containing waste of the passing ships.
The offers must be addressed to the intervention centres, which have good warehouses and resale opportunities.
And now we are told the camps are too expensive.
Most of my group supports the rapporteur's amendment that military facilities or camps should fall within the scope of the directive.
The entire camp is divided into different rooms.
It should in principle be possible for Germany, France or England to dump their radioactive waste in a camp in Sweden.
The concentration of production capacity allows for maximum economies of scale and leads to the abandonment of intermediate production, storage and handling sites, leading to population effects in the production and distribution areas.
Up to the point of individualisation, the number of bearings is kept as low as possible, reducing storage risk, storage costs and transit times.
Specific applications include: Businessmen who want to access their fax and EPost transfers from outside and without special equipment, sellers who want to check without a terminal whether a given product is at the warehouse, and individuals who want to check their bank account by telephone.
Development of intelligent storage and handling systems to optimize product quality.
New developments in the field of biotechnology allow for new ways of reducing quality losses and developing environmentally friendly storage and handling systems.
- at levels 03 and 04 in direct connection with the warehouse and the charging zone (tracts FG.GH.GM and MN): The workrooms for printing and distribution as well as the rooms of maintenance services;
This service takes care of removals, storage (including the warehouses in Overijse) as well as insurance and collection of the stock.
This could not be achieved, however, because the negotiating conference was unable to resolve disagreements on certain fundamental issues (particularly the general size of the camps, their division among member states, the details of developing countries "participation in storage, and the price levels that the camp intervenes to achieve through inclusion or levy).
The Council decided to increase the monthly increments for the 1981 / 82 marketing year by about 20%, in order to take account of the development of the storage and financing costs for cereal storage and the need to reduce the stocks of cereals according to the needs of the market.
This increase, which applies to cereals, flour of wheat and rye, as well as to coarse and fine gries of wheat, has been granted within the framework of the objectives of the basic 'cereals' regulation, taking into account the stock and financing costs of cereal storage in the Community, as well as the need to reduce the stocks of cereals in a way that does not cause market disturbances.
Data processing, office, procurement, general maintenance, maintenance of equipment, vehicle park, driver, warehouse and archives
The Council took this decision within the framework of the objective of the basic regulation on cereals, in order to take account of the storage and financing costs for cereal storage in the Community and to allow a sale of stocks of cereals, which does not cause market disruption.
Installation of a k 300 ha large oil palm and an 835 ha cocoa crop on the east coast of the island of Neuirland; construction of a palm oil mill as well as warehouses and loading facilities; repair of cocoa processing plants
- the workrooms for printing and distribution as well as the rooms of maintenance services located on levels 03 and 04 in direct connection with the warehouse and the charging zone (tracts FG, GH, GM and MN);
While staff working at the business site need a lower qualification, those responsible for warehouse management and data technology need a much higher level of education and training.
Stock changes can be identified either as a difference between the stock at the end and the stock at the beginning of the reporting year, or as a difference between the access to the stock during the reporting year and the departures from the stock.
It excludes harbour vehicles, lighters and smugglers used in seaports, ferries, fishing vessels, dredging vessels, hydraulic work vessels and vessels used exclusively as warehouses, floating workshops, houseboats and recreational purposes.
The rapid growth in final demand in some Member States during the quarterly period has led to the dismantling of stocks in France (-1.2% of GDP) in the Netherlands (-1.0% of GDP), Denmark (-0.7% of GDP) and Sweden (-0.2% of GDP), with the three latter countries also changing to an opposite trend compared to the previous quarter.
Sales of olive oil from stocks of the Italian intervention centre were made repeatedly; at the end of 1978 there were still around 95 000 tonnes in stock.
Workshops and warehouses are necessary for mechanical maintenance, boiler work, electrical repairs etc.
X-Three fulfils numerous tasks; it manages the warehouse and distribution centre; its premises cover 5.4 ha; it employs more than 640 people, of whom about 240 are responsible for managing X-Three.
"As Belgian subsidiaries, even if any representation capable of making commitments for the foreign company is lacking, the seats of the actual management, branch offices, factories, works, workshops, agencies, shops, offices, laboratories, shopping or sales accounts, warehouses as well as all local facilities that provide returns of their kind."
In particular, the Court would like to know whether such a purchase business is in place when the purchase contract between two companies located outside the Community customs area has been concluded, but the buyer, a subsidiary of the seller, has a branch established in that area, which has the task of ordering the goods to the seller, managing the warehouses and distributing the goods to the customers, in particular to the distributors for the products sold under the trademark.
Value of stocks (in stock) at the beginning of the invoice year (exclusively animals).
Already collected or still to be collected amount of sales of products in stock at the beginning of the invoice year or of products harvested during the financial year.

Spaces where feedingstuffs are stored should be cool, dry as well as secured against intoxicants and insects; the spaces used as a warehouse for envelopes should be dry as well as secured against intoxicants and insects.
This complex includes plants to produce more than 560 000 tonnes of sulphuric acid, 220 000 tonnes of phosphoric acid and 240 000 tonnes of fertilisers a year, as well as other related equipment, including a thermal power plant with a turbo generator of 13 MW and storage and extraction facilities.
Commission Opinion 90 / 389 / EEC on the Windscale glazing plant and the glazed radioactive waste camp (United Kingdom).
As a result, high elasticity vis-√†-vis the share of capital inflows in assets can correspond to a low level of stock adjustment.
Aside from losses caused by persistent inventory, processing, and transportation problems, supply will decline, because farmers, who evidently expect a further increase in prices following the increase in government purchase prices in May 1990, are hoarding the grain.
Obviously, the partially dismantled stockpiles of pre and intermediate products will be replenished in the spring.
The development prospects for production, for their part, remain positive, even if they deteriorate by one point (+ 5 versus + 6) and thus return to their July level, which is undoubtedly related to the slightly more unfavourable expectations regarding the size of the stock of unsold manufactured goods (+ 12 versus + 11) (Table 2).
The indicator is the means of answers (balances) to questions about the production prospects, the order books and the bearings (the latter after changing the sign).
The indicator is the means of answers (balances) to questions about the production prospects, the order books and the bearings (the latter after changing the sign).
The overall optimistic climate in the industry has ever been somewhat tempered by the slight weakness in the assessment of orders and inventories that occurred in May compared with the previous month.
The indicator is the means of answers (balances) to questions about the production prospects, the order books and the bearings (the latter after changing the sign).
Halves in the cedar will be substantial in 1985 (particularly in the UK), but almost fully offset by an increase in stockpiles in the UK's power plants.
Indeed, at the end of August 1975, the nine-member community held almost 1 Mill, t (322 000 t in 1974), despite the 2.4% decline in production in 1974 compared with 1973, and the 6.2% increase in the first months of 1975 (January to April) did not seem so spectacular.
In recent years, retention, storage and transport technology for milk products have been developed, disseminated and made cheaper to the extent that the supra-regional supply of all milk products is now practicable.
The destination requirement is met when all goods stored in a given space are over-appropriated ("space security contract") or when items to be taken from the warehouse are individually labelled ("marking contracts").
However, the market can also be supported by more elastic measures such as storage or distillation aid, withdrawal by producer communities, among others.
Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope's brother George Ratzinger"
The reigning Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope's brother George Ratzinger.
This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann thinks.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to cause discussion.
Christian Weisender, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," declared after publication to the German Press Agency that he expected an apology from the former reigning bishop and current Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig M√ºller, as well as from the Cathedral Master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if M√ºller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret about their own omissions or their mistaken assessment of what happened at the time.
The Vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano, on the other hand, criticized the fact that "double standards" were applied in reporting on violence in the cathedral spatts.
As for the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that these are "shameful and shameful acts" that must be punished and prevented in the future; but what is striking is the "degree of media manipulation," according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, a historian and a member of Italy's National Bioethics Committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider this normal," Scaraffia writes.
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also remarked in the interview with Bavarian radio: "You like to go out to church and that's a folded fresco."
She also pointed out that in her youth, "beatings had been a very normal educational means" "to deal with cheeky children, like I was one."
It would be unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with reports of the abuse cases, Pope's brother George Ratzinger often appeared.
Completely wrongly, according to author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the remembrance band "My Brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he assesses the findings of the final report.
What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by Ulrich Weber, the lawyer responsible for the Enlightenment by Bistum Regensburg?
A total of 547 reigning cathedral spatts were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of assaults, 67 Domspatzen.
The final report says to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can therefore be noted that in many cases, Domkapellmaster R. has used forms of physical and psychological violence.
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many other accused, it is striking that many victims appreciated R. "s general humanity and therefore, in numerous cases, even combine positive memories with him, despite violence."
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is, in his opinion, relieved.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violent use of protective agents at the Regensburg Domspatzen" gives a conflicting picture of Domkapellmaster Georg Ratzinger.
For one thing, many students highlight his "humanity."
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist who has often been handcuffed when a cathedral set musically brought no top performance.
How do you, as his biographer, view this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble and read the whole 440 page report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is in it at all.
He is devoted to just eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the horrific cases of sexual abuse.
Violence at preschool also occurred outside its sphere of action.
At best, he can be accused of learning about it too late, or of not taking initial suggestions seriously enough.
The cathedral gymnasium on which he worked was perceived by virtually all respondents as - literally - "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."
So too does the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger's excellent testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted," "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and bonkers and was "always surrounded by grapes of children."
Only a minority complain about its perfectionism and high level of emotionality, which has already led to rage.
That he not only punched with chairs and threw the key dog on the ground, but also distributed earpieces and pulled all-too-cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
It must be said, however, that in the period in question, the 1960 "s and 1970" s, such educational methods were widespread, both among parents and among teachers.
Do you also know such punishment methods?
Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.
I, too, have still experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
However, compared to what this report is actually about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the violence at pre-school, these are bagatelles.
One wonders whether it is not more to do with his notoriety and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI that many media outlets have just rushed to him.
In the Bavarian Pope, many who never understood him are still working diligently.
The truth, though, is that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
In the media, a great deal has been reported in connection with the report on the issue of abuse at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
Will Georg Ratzinger also be accused in the final report of any involvement or complicity with regard to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
Not a single one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted himself to the cathedral master.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one constable representing the others, "It was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem in investigating sexual abuse was, and still is, that most victims remain silent out of shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, it is certainly not a choir leader who would have been, in a professional sense, a colleague of the perpetrators.
So how do the Domspatzen students rate Ratzinger's role in terms of the abuse cases?
As Michael Hesemann put it: "With regard to sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator.
I think it is also really absurd to assume that it is him... boys who have opened up more forcefully or more clearly or even more than their parents, boarding school leaders, trust teachers, etc.
That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "
So the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that he was entrusted to affected students and / or their environment beforehand could not be confirmed as part of the investigation."
So, as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger must be exempt from any complicity.
So neither can he be accused of not preventing him or being put on display.
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these repugnant crimes, as has unfortunately happened in some cases.
There was much to read in the media about "violent lunches" at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
Former Cathedral captain Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report of "looking away."
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That's the big problem, after all, that in the coverage everything was mixed and mesmerised into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violent eating and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that, in turn, is an abuse of the report.
After all, it is neatly separated: Between the preschool and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence and, let us say, other allegations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the Domspatzen.
The whole terrible canvassing pedagogy, the cases in which boys were actually harassed and painted by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly, all occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But with those, Domkapellmaster Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got to face the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
On that, as most witnesses point out, the issue of "preschool" was taboo.
One was only happy to have escaped her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "parochial" conditions.
So what was different on the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but there was no sadistic violence.
And the same is true of Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even have positive memories with him, despite violence."
So, at most, there remains the accusation of having looked away.
But despite all the efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which he was told of the conditions at preschool.
The first time in 1970 / 71, when he was just starting to establish himself, and from what was happening at a school where he just didn't work and was responsible, (the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently lock his ears before the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because back in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduced.
In it, he points out to them that "caning continues to be practiced in preschool."
Even given the risk of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when there was legal clarity, when caning sentences had long been banned in Bavaria too.
Before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as all of us probably still know.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where those affected might have been exaggerated or dramatised and where the permissible limit had really been crossed.
But you also can't say he'd always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was only in 1980 that caning at schools was officially abolished in Bavaria too.
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "pitfalls of anachronism," that is, the danger of evaluating the past by today's moral standards.
The prince is already right.
But this does not, of course, apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorrent at all times, nor to what was violated in pre-school in terms of resentment and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond what it was then.
That's all quite terrible and I'm glad it's finally being worked out.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishing, in other words slap and pulling on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When corporal punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his reigning time did Georg Ratzinger reflect in the talks with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Has the issue of caning also been raised?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict's XVI, told from his perspective, as the Domspatzen only played a supporting role.
Nevertheless, I do not conceal the fact that he had a strict regiment there.
But that, too, must be said: Without this perfectionism, without demanding unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world-class institution out of the previously more nationally known Regensburg Domspatzen, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the US (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and bonkers alone, you don't make great singers out of recalcitrant boys and face any success, in whatever field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
As what kind of man have you experienced George Ratzinger during the conversations on her book?
Michael Hesemann: By working on the book and beyond, I have really met Georg Ratzinger quite well and have repeatedly experienced him as a wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply faithful and heartfelt person who you can't imagine that he could do anything even to a fly.
I regularly get on with how many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his emulation, regularly keep in touch with him, visit him, read him out - he's almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.
So those who do not forgive him for once being strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also an adorable respect person to whom they still look up today and whom they worship downright.
And please, once again very clearly: All that is being accused of is educational methods, which were the order of the day at the time.
We can be glad that we have long since overcome this time.
But it is highly unfair to make a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother, a media scapegoat.
The evil intent behind it is all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves it.
Now the decency would dictate that a 93-year-old man, who has earned great merits and without those outside Bavaria, and perhaps still Germany, no one would know the reigning Domspatzen, would finally be left in peace.
In the face of all the difficulties and lack of resources in carrying out these operations, I can welcome the fact that last year we also succeeded in significantly reducing the commitment of the United Nations in Tajikistan and the Central African Republic.

Some of the jurors have said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years, and her carpenter, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, had met them with disgust.

Orwell's prophecy could have turned out to be absolutely right since then, where every movement can be controlled thanks to the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the chosen highway, and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
