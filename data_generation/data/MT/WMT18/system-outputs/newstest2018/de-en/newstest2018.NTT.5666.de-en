Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
An asylum where young people are supposed to meet today.
A pit chapel, where is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small gardeners manage the former land of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich reveals exciting stories.
It is annoying when maps are out of date.
This is familiar to anyone who has ever had to get upset, because the Navi car showed a green meadow instead of a bypass.
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian atlas, an offer by the Bavarian Geoportal of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but for this very reason very enlightening.
Especially if you compare them with current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the distribution area of the Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern Atlas is a patchwork quilt that is not immediately recognizable as such.
More detailed maps, so-called judging sheets, for cities and municipalities have been included in the large map.
According to the Bavarian surveying administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and stem from the first survey of Bavaria.
Your sponsor: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the second coalition war with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical recording of Bavaria - for military purposes, of course.
Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, it was today's neighbours who created the idea of a comprehensive map of Bavaria.
Elector Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the "Topographical Bureau" - and with it the Bavarian surveying administration.
The Official Journal for Munich dates back to 1856 and, like all others, can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.
The comparison between the past and the present is most impressive on the example of the provincial capital.
The city has spread in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which still appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated as a district of Munich 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. in 1877.
Today Untersendling is in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendling concentrate around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserstraße, which was only named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian peasants "uprising against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: Hand-written flurries from the so-called "primeval recording" from which the property tax was derived.
Today, small plots are no longer occupied by farmers - but by small gardeners of the "Land in the Sun" plant.
A large green area stands out to the north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, the site of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was actually still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In today's Au-Haidhausen district, the original page reads not only the street name "at the Gasteig" or the height "On the air" - but also in large letters, "Irren Anstalt."
Yes, here on the Auerfeldstrasse people were once locked up with delusions.
There, in 1858 / 59, the Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt "On the Air" was created.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chains of the so-called lunatics.
He has also forbidden the staff to use violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Haidhausen Museum, who has been working with the institution for an exhibition.
At first there was room for 280 patients, later it was extended to 500 places.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the roundabout facility in Haar 1905.
The Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of the largest psychiatrists in Germany, has been located there since 2006.
On the site of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in the Salesianum in Munich.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training companies.
To the west lies the football field of the TSV Munich East, to the east residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built, in an architectural style similar to the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed by bombing raids during the Second World War.
The Marienplatz was listed as the "main square" around 1856, and the Kaufinger Gasse was the name of the shopping street.
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs ripped many holes into the city centre in December 1944.
A big one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a greenery chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where the preparatory work is taking place these days and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second commuter railway line.
With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared to the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.
He reports that those waiting in queues for the security check repeatedly ask what the problem was and receive from the security officials the answer "There is no problem."
On the whole, things went smoothly in most places, even if it was quite inefficient in the hospital - people stowed themselves in a long queue. "
I left the polling station at about 17: 00 and the queue was about a kilometre long.
A snake in front of a Takoyaki shop.
Ahmad Shuja uploaded a photo via Twitter showing people queuing in a long queue to get their voting card.
At some polling stations in Malawi the queues were so long that people could not see the polling station at the end of the queue.
"Today the snake is long," she notes as she walks.
Normally there is an extra snake for the students.
"And they closed the queue for the students, but it's important," Vicki continues, ignoring Arlet.
Civil rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colors has issued a warning for colored people travelling to Missouri due to the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, due to enter into force by August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when traveling through the state and exercise extreme caution, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents are reported here in recent times and throughout the state."
A recently passed Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
"You have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten up or killed, "the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told the Kansas City Star.
'we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet. '
It is the first such warning the organization has issued for a state in the US.
The group cited incidents such as racist misdemeanours against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gasoline during the journey through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The council also points to a recent report by the attorney general's office of Missouri, which shows that black motorists in the state are stopped 75 percent more frequently than whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and co-workers about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
'People need to be ready, whether it's bringing deposit money or letting relatives know they're travelling through the state. '
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, which ranked the state in 16th place in the country in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or job discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
There are approximately 13 centres in the north-western border province, and there are 30 more camps in Beluchistan, but they are smaller.
It is no longer possible to look at the problem from the point of view of participation or non-participation, and thus to enter into one of the two opposing camps.
At the moment, in southern Afghanistan, logistical camps, rolling transports and the expansion of world airports are creating the military preconditions for getting to grips with Beluchistan and getting to the Indian Ocean.
The hospitals and police clinics as well as the camps near the border were looted.
There are United Nations camps guarded day and night.
The Israeli government assured the presidency that the security measures around Palestinian camps would be strengthened.
With the reopening of the camps, the police cracking down on the residential areas of ordinary people and mass arrests in the early hours of the morning, the regime wanted to react brutally, scandalously in our view, to the ever-growing dissatisfaction and popular anger at the difficulties and economic failure of the regime.
This organisation has limited responsibility for assisting refugees living outside the camps.
Indeed, countries are known where there is a kind of revolt around the camps, because the local population has the impression that the refugees in the camps are better off than themselves.

Mr President, I would like to conclude by saying that, although we are satisfied with the electoral process, we are not so happy with the demobilisation process, since the Honduran Government has recently prevented the international organisations mentioned in the Tela Convention from visiting the Contras camps.

We welcome everything the Commission has done and I am sure that when the Commissioner visits the camps he will insist on a thorough investigation of the camps.
Many died in the resistance, others fled to camps in neighbouring Papua New Guinea (PNG), but even there they cannot feel safe.
I agree with the honourable Member on the importance of preserving concentration camps for future generations as a testimony of Nazi crimes against humanity, but I believe that the sites of several camps have already been placed under the permanent protection of the competent national and local authorities for the reason mentioned by the honourable Member.
I have visited a camp other than Mrs Ewing: A camp with 97 000 refugees on the border with Somalia, run by non-governmental organisations, the European Community and other donors.

However, it seems that several of these camps are under the constant protection of the competent national and / or local authorities.
I thought the old left and Rousseau's utopia had long been buried, responsible for the millions of deaths of the gulags and the camps of Communist China.
Parts of the population are deported to camps in the Arab north, with the sole aim of depriving the Nuba people of their Christian faith and culture.
The Community and its Member States have also condemned the existence of detention camps, particularly in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and called for the camps to be opened immediately for international inspection and for them to be disbanded as quickly as possible.
This can also be blamed on the Lebanese Government, which, by refusing to allow the deported Palestinians into the country and also by refusing to allow aid agencies access to the provisional camp, has no other aim than to exploit the matter for political purposes to the detriment of Israel.
For several weeks, after the discovery of the camps, we have been discovering the rapes.
This attention and financial support must not be confined to the camps located in the territory of the Community, but must also, if not above all, apply to the camps located in the rest of Europe.

Grazing fence project is elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will be continued in the coming year.
CDU members Peter White and Kordula Kovac took a picture on the spot.
At the Schwendemann family's graveyard, representatives of the fishermen's CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.
Markus Schwendemann first provided insights into his farm, in which he farmed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, fed 40 dairy cows and just as many young animals and housed holiday guests in five apartments.

This left the farmers with EUR 12 610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence.
"The big advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You are doing a really good job, you cannot do without farmers and rural women."
Peter White also stated: "This is where the best foods are produced."

Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty
The surest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.
The Americans value these as much as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically curb legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he had done it.
But he attacked its meaning, and in particular the meaning attributed to it, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed.
As Miller Acosta quipped, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you're referring to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. '
Miller is factually correct, but as he himself put it, it's not really about history.
It's about the contemporary resonance to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / your beleaguered masses who yearn to breathe freely, / the wretched of your coasts."
There was never a time when the "miserable waste" was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's US.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute: It is indeed a conflict about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to place their words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were performing a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American Republicanism by depicting in a worn classical visual representation the female embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has been given a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of exiles.
The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change this back a long time ago.
The great shrine Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty did not invite anyone, but was rather an early neo-conservative who brought the American flame to the encircled world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is meant to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not meant to light the way to the United States. '
It is quite unusual for Limbaugh to come across something here.
The meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the standpoint of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
In the truest sense, it's about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And that, of course, is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not meant to light the way, but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to Britain's team
The UK's performance director of athletics, Neil Black, says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Cup squad "will make a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which kicks off on Friday.
Black believes "something special is developing in Scotland" and UK athletics needs to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we're trying to understand it, and we'll keep it going until we find out," Black said.
'i talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it's something to do with what they've done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they've done.
And also with the type at the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant. '
Several of the Scottish athletes are medals contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will line up against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle has been voted team captain by the squad.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible, "Black says.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, walked out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought in quite naturally were great. "
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete at her fifth World Championships in the 400m hurdles, says it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British squad.
Scotland's previous best total of athletes at the World Cup was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The middle-distance runner Muir leads this way and set five British and two European records last year.
She will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m races.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 metres, is another Scot to watch after a great season that included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships, when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots not only belong to the team, but in some cases will also participate in the medals and finals.
"The special thing about being team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a huge honour anyway, but knowing that my team-mates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added.
'Obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.
It just shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise to podiums.
As for my speech as captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home World Cup.
So it's really important to put on this home support and take advantage of the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium.
I'll get a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such a great atmosphere out there. '
Decisive for the site was our desire to create an audio platform that provides a space for emerging talent from a wide range of areas in the region.
Overall, the EP supported the harmonisation proposals by a large majority, even though some victims of the parties involved and certain deviations from the usual policy in some Member States were called for, because it was clear that without harmonisation of cost factors and legislation, not much progress could be made towards greater freedom of movement.
The need, the benefits and the gradual realisation of such a project must be recognised and felt by all, so that the efforts and necessary sacrifices are made on a voluntary basis.
But how can we demand these sacrifices from our peoples, our constituents, when the same voters read about such human rights violations in the newspapers every day?
Nevertheless, I believe that farmers are prepared to make these short-term sacrifices so that the health of the people can be improved in the long term.
Mr Berkhouwer pointed out how bitter this is for the sportsmen who have made sacrifices for years, who have taken privations to attend this event.
This is not about us refusing to make a sacrifice, but about the impossibility of returning to the constituency and returning in time on Monday morning.
The hanged people of Tunis did not die for nothing if their victim triggered a legitimate indictment against the regime of Bourguiba, this so-called free world, and if they are a confirmation of the need to oppose human rights violations wherever they occur.
They are certainly words that she uttered with the feeling of a woman, a democrat, an anti-fascist fighter who has known the victim.
This is borne out by the commitment and the sacrifices - including of people - to which some of the nine have been, and continue to be, ready for this country and its people by allocating troop levels to the UN peacekeeping forces.
However, imparting values credibly also means convincing others that, if necessary, one is also prepared to make sacrifices for these values.
In view of this situation, it seems logical that a co-responsibility levy should also be imposed on fats of vegetable and maritime origin imported into the Community under preferential conditions, in exchange for the sacrifices charged to milk producers.
This also explains the heroic sacrifice of Bobby Sands, O'Hara, Hughes, MacCreesh and Joe MacDonnell, who sadly died yesterday after sixty days of hunger strike, enjoying the approval and support of Irish Catholics and a large part of European and world public opinion.
This is what is meant by the word "victim."
Our imagination demands some sacrifices on the part of the rich.
The Olympic champions from many countries, who bravely made a huge personal sacrifice, also believed that the community would keep its promise.
There is no point in us imposing heavy sacrifices on ourselves if our competitors use them for their own growth.
And the success of the Camp David agreement shows that, for the first time in history, the military victors have made material sacrifices in order to bring about peace.
This action - I have to say - will demand great sacrifices from the people and the workers, sacrifices which must appear to them to be hated if they do not quite clearly find their justification in the efficiency of the installations and a sufficient balance between the surplus and the deficit in production and consumption per capita of the individual Member States.
Thirdly, account must be taken of the great efforts and sacrifices made by Luxembourg to restructure its steel industry since the beginning of the steel crisis, in other words since 1975.
Enlargement would pose a dramatic threat to the Spanish fishing industry and even this sacrifice could not prevent our production capacity from being substantially reduced.
Considerable misgivings have been expressed about the fact that sacrifices - after all, sacrifices were demanded - should be made on an equal footing by farmers in all countries.
We state quite categorically that we do not stand with our backs to the wall and do not need to impose new sacrifices on small and medium-sized farmers; we can do otherwise.
The agriculture ministers have been realistic and I know that all our farmers will be prepared to make some sacrifices in order to promote the long-term viability and stability of the common agricultural policy.
The victims must, however, be distributed evenly among the Member States, and I strongly reject the idea that British farmers should be worse off than their European counterparts.
Bearing in mind that we must all participate equally in the happy and unpleasant events of the Community and that it now requires sacrifices if the economy is to be put back on track, we accept the proposals for price increases in the Woltjer report.
Members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats even go so far as to call in the resolution they have signed with others for a fair distribution of the victims.
We must also remember that if the democratic parties of Europe had been vigilant and determined, this sacrifice of so many might not have been necessary.
However, these efforts will have to continue for some time, otherwise all the sacrifices that have already been made, particularly in terms of jobs, would have been pointless.
A civilised state must avoid the sacrifice of those who are not involved.
The economic losses, the number of human victims in the fire fighting, the costs are so high that they can no longer be borne by individuals, by the Autonomous Communities, by the municipalities and the municipalities, thus leading to serious economic upheavals.
Needless to say, several important parts of the programme fell victim to this reduction, including, in particular, research in the field of aeronautics.
It would therefore be unfair to remember only one part of the victims and not to mention the other part.
Now everyone who has a little common sense knows that you have to be able to make compromises and make sacrifices if you live together in a twelfth place.
Through this sacrifice, they succeeded effectively in stirring up the international conscience and unleashing a wave of solidarity with the Afghan people, which is now culminating in this victory.
But in the name of what purpose are we being asked to make all these great efforts, all these upheavals, all these sacrifices?
In line with these efforts, producers outside the Community should make similar sacrifices in order to achieve a more stable balance on world markets.
The Polish people, who have been suffering for years from the shortage and scarcity of basic products, have just embarked on an ambitious process of recovery and economic reforms which will demand further efforts and sacrifices from this courageous and patient people.
The families of the Sellafield workers are now being asked to make a huge sacrifice.
Only then will all the soldiers of Europe, whose blood as an invisible ordeal for the victims of the past has bended the doorstep of every house in this area and soaked every parcel in fields, meadows and gardens, only then will all these soldiers who have fallen in battle be able to rest in peace!
On the contrary, they would lead to greater social and national sacrifices, especially for the weakest nations.
They have worked generation after generation and made heavy sacrifices.
I am told that every country must make sacrifices in order to build a well-organised, integrated and efficient community, both small and large.
Pakistan is a country that has already made great sacrifices in the war in Afghanistan with the reception of millions of refugees.
In addition to these very general plans, we should not forget that there are special cases, such as the case of Poland, in that the Poles were the first to initiate this process of democratisation and were prepared to make sacrifices for it when our world policy was ready.
Parliament should approve measures which make the United States conciliatory, but which require a great sacrifice on the part of European farmers.
The sinking of fishing boats by submarines can be avoided, and I urge the Commission and the governments of the Member States to agree immediately on appropriate procedures to ensure that the crew of the Antares was the last victim of the Cold War by our fishermen.
We knew that war is the victim in politics.
I believe that the Council must ensure that something is done for the minorities that remain, including in a smaller Yugoslavia; in particular, the victims in Bosnia-Herzegovina also need attention.
The one-net rule proposed will impose different hardships and sacrifices on fishermen in different regions and waters that will not be met by the bank.
While this is a unique achievement in the history of international shipping (thanks to the self-sacrifice of the crew and the perfect coordination of the captain's rescue operations in exceptionally difficult weather conditions, there was not a single victim), the deliberate slander was guided by low motives of unfair competition.
We will all have to make sacrifices in our way of life, in production and in consumption.
Secondly, we need to strengthen the principle of safety and environmental protection, to raise standards and European and international controls throughout the cycle, from shipbuilding to ports and shipping, which is vital in order to prevent the negative spiral that has led to more and more accidents and more accidents.
That is why both the Moroccan authorities and the public have used their association with the Community as an essential element in their internal political discussion, precisely because they have had the opportunity to "sell" to their own people, so to speak, that it is necessary for a more stable and better future to take on these victims.
I wish governments would follow the example of those people who show more commitment and sacrifice in the face of such a human tragedy.
The question, however, is whether we have the means to achieve our objectives and whether we have the courage to explain to our respective populations what sacrifices they must make so that we can use sufficient resources to achieve our objectives.
Of course, the necessary restructuring cannot be driven by selfishness, but by a clear stance on the part of the Commission, so that the sacrifices of the social partners and the investment efforts of the last few decades will not have been in vain.
In my country beef is the most important agricultural export - no other product has that importance - and because we export 80% of our total beef production, the whole GATT issue carries enormous weight for us, and it is quite certain that we will have to pay more than the sacrifices that have already been made in the CAP.
The restoration of the market and the balance between supply and demand are to be sought in the restriction of production, even if this solution is difficult in view of the sacrifices involved.

Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't apply for public office if you can't tolerate the heating up of voters
The father of our country knew something of bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to beat him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.
He chimed at the criticism, for sure.
But he has not silenced his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, dumb and dumb, we are led like sheep to slaughter."
Which brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's staff have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him because of that earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Na, and?."
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it is important.
And it's particularly important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazingly popular.
He has the second highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary heathead.
He has shown a firm hand in running his state and strict adherence to principles.
He was also very adept at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents and playfully debuting his hapless head after chemotherapy on his page.
Thus, blocking people coming to the governor's side - which is a public forum called official and by employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people swinging the whip online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people who talk to their elected leaders: A teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the comments section of the "The Post" news release.
"I don't appreciate this idea either, if a number of people take a position on the same subject, then some people disregard it more as a so-called collective effort and do not recognize it as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor's staff described as a "concentrated spam attack," others would probably call "intercession."
The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in earlier times, if one had done the same, that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or to arrest and silence protesters.
But this is exactly what is happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for slamming Facebook and other social media outlets.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on this issue fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That should not be so hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable port had a similar effect to the internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers swooped in on his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that put down Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticising his position on the Amity Treaty, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse are the foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
A week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks said that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's ordinary shares at the unified price of $25.25, making a total of $3 billion.
The estimated price is less than 19% of the share price of August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will secure it a 10% profit and can be resold at a price of $31.25.
The last few weeks have been tough for the group, which has seen its stock market price fall by half, while the price of insurance against insolvency soared.

On the 17th, two dead women shrouded in blankets were discovered in the settlement of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning Huixquilucan found the body of a man wrapped in a yellow-blue blanket, probably named Mario Ríos, according to the news that his killers left behind him.
In view of the dense smog burning in the throat and laying like a blanket over China's major cities on a few days, improving air quality in China is one of the most urgent environmental issues.
In doing so, he wants to say that they should invest more in innovative projects than in those that offer "safe social returns" - for example, a certain number of blankets that are purchased with a donation.

Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at the Renaissance Club
Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comforts over the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who led links to the final round last year next door at the Archerfield before losing against Paul Eales, has been linked to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen the Renaissance Club built, and we see how it achieves its glory with this event," Rafferty said.
'the players will see this course at its best, he's in a great state.

'you want to do it well, but you also feel that extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played some solid golf.
I am happy with the way things have gone so far. "
Joining the trio on the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.

"Nobody dares to walk around the village after 5pm," she says.
It is a rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that began in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were due to vote in front of the occupying forces by a public hike.
An existing movement that stirred up for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea encompassing the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire, and then a 5-hour morning car journey by car.
There is no public transport.
The town of about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and corrugated iron roofs that have been converted by rust into various yellow-brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were also other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, pointing to her vibrant, hand-woven turban, her dark shirt and her bright skirt.
"We used to have only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's gold country.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province the size of New Jersey with 153,000 residents.
In 2015 alone, Freeport lost $3.1 billion in gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papuans, who ensure that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a stifling presence.
A 2005 investigation in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970 "s became genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
"We will lose everything" says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which included reports of atrocities from the previous year, such as unlawful executions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular, according to another report - and the brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have intensified as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but the demographic trend is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanesian waiting canteens sell fried chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people struggle to keep up here.
"The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.
'it has cost the local Papua - the mum-mum [the women] of Papua - their market. '
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised to address inequalities and rights violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua, little has changed, and today the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, just two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October, Paniai suffered a low point.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside, singing Christmas carols in front of a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The terrified children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offence at their clay and later came back with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had been drinking were hunting and beating the group with their rifle butts, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so severely that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting arches and performed the Waita dance - running in circles and imitating a bird song - by Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators began throwing stones at police and military posts.
As the mood heated up, the soldiers were sent an order via an internal funk: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," according to an official TIME document, which has not been released to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood of Enarotali, saw the imminent danger and called for calm and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says that the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was," Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, bears only one name, told TIME in gloomy mood.
'i saw he was dead... I kissed him. '
The chief inspector of the Papua police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" her station because she was being attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesman Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
'it's about life and death. '
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
The news of the killings came 'filtered' to Jakarta only the following day.
For three weeks, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura in which he expressed sympathies for the families of the victims and vowed to address the historical grievances in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so it won't happen again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an out-of-court mechanism to settle historic human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90's and early 2000's.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to be gone through, "he said.
Then Wiranto made a withdrawal when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is legislated for," he said.
Wiranto, whom the UN has indicted for "crimes against humanity" that claimed more than 1,000 lives in East Timor's bloody independence vote of 1999, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims took such claims with grim incredulity.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there's been no progress whatsoever," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
'i'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid of being shot. '
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military searched for me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to take an unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned when he was fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company's site office.
Police said that the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one.
"We were so panicked, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly hospitalized here, according to TIME.
'i've been hiding in my house for two days. '
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for the police's mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a source of trouble for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribal members Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army which claims to defend Papua's rights by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years, under the pretext of "securing national sovereignty."
Some never show up again.
Among people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
The people here grow everything they eat: Especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women, who can each work four or five fields of sweet potato.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between native Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabire airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of Paniai's tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tense.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck ESCUDIE and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua due to a lack of coordination with related institutions, although they were given rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi's election campaign to lift reporting restrictions in order to promote transparency and development have not been realised.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: Visa denial and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta: "A democratic system still applies in Indonesia and there is free media so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and urged him "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the panic ai shots," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papuans, regard their vote for Jokowi as a "debt" that he must repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai gunshot victims carried out a final symbolic act of defiance: The body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus says with his head lowered.
"What else can we do?"
Fire capture the 'Torch' skyscraper of Dubai for the second time
A fire took place in one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 337-metre-high, 79-storey building.
It is the second fire to sweep through the high-rise building in just two years, which is accidentally called the Torch Tower (torch tower).
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word on the cause of the blaze.
"We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and when people were screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor, "one resident, who gave his name as George, told Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said fire-fighting units extinguished the fire at around 4am local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected.
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage came from cladding, exterior cladding to decoration or insulation.
In Britain, police said they believe the system of plates used for insulation and cladding at London's Grenfell Tower in June may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died.

No Davis Cup reform: Continue best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has fallen through with his great Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup singles only on two winning sets was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-set classics, which are often very long, but also very much appreciated, are thus preserved in the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of member countries voted in favor of the reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was only narrowly missed.

Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the attack in Catalonia, several thousand dollars had been sent through a money transfer company, "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "commando" that put an end to the lives of 106 people.
As is generally known, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will fulfil the prescribed sanction in the next league match against the Auxerre and thus enter the next phase of the game without any cards.
The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is rather common in the world of football.
The advantage is obviously that the players start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 was supposed to end with an 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phone), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment here is contactless technology, which allows payments on public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Its market share should increase further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent more than 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept these.

On the other side of the square were tents in which cotton goods, blankets and stockings were haggled, alongside horse dishes and piles of colorful ribbons, the ends of which were fluttering in the wind.

It did not occur to him to determine all the details in the condition of the sick person, to think about how this body lay there under the ceiling, in what curved posture these emaciated lower legs and hips and this meagre back were stored and whether it was somehow possible to store them better, even if it was not so bad.
The wheelbarrow was brought in, the body was laid out, enveloped with a blanket and tied with knitting.
More than 1 in 5 US travellers bring banned items into the plane, a survey finds
A survey among airline passengers found that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously smuggled prohibited items past U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while accidentally carrying banned knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed they had discovered belatedly that they had mistakenly travelled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers were more likely to flout the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared with less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items intentionally passed by TSA agents were food and fluids.
More than 3 percent admitted having knowingly carried items with blades through security control, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had intentionally brought prohibited drugs into the plane.
The company said it had interviewed travelers across the country to find out how many had inadvertently brought contraband goods through airport security and how many had done it deliberately.
It's no surprise that the people most likely to carry contraband - knowingly or unknowingly - through security were the ones who fly most often.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure what liquids they are allowed to take with them or how much of it.
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids seized by the TSA are prohibited.
For a time, people thought the TSA could view books as contraband.
Fluids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk it doesn't matter: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Electro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk likes to give with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3."
So far, he has failed to acknowledge that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-triumphant figures for sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has for the first time revealed a different, less luminous figure in the announcement of the latest quarterly balance: The cancellations of the new mass-market Model 3.
Musk had frequently advertised in the past few months with the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, the delivery of which is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: Out of a total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation, Tesla will repay the 1000 Euro (1000 US dollars in the US and 1000 pounds in the UK) "reservation deposit" in full.
There are currently 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk acknowledged in a conference call with analysts.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of so far about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge of ambitious growth targets lies not with demand, but with the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018 - all models put together - there will be 500,000, and in 2020 a million.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1,800 reservations per day.
Anyone ordering a "Model 3" today can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand-new production lines, which have never been tested in practice, without major disruptions with maximum capacity utilization.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are major delays, the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent unhappy customers from running away in droves.
EPA chief Pruitt withdraws because of delay in Obama-Era rules to reduce emissions
A day after he had been sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of the Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency proved itself to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the lawsuit, which had been brought against his previous post in a federal appeals court.
It is about a deadline that expired on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance for a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering in local decisions or hampering economic growth."
Pruitt, who was a prosecutor of Oklahoma before he was appointed by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry oppose.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Prut's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his U-turn on ozone standards simply reinforces EPA's willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indicted by activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in legal regulation and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously. "
Still, the EPA's opinion said that Pruitt will at some point use his "power to delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the regulations are "based on sound policies and the best available information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive rewrite of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is expected to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had sued the EPA this week, said the group planned to maintain legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal - according to our lawsuits - is an important win for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog pouring into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia in this case.
Ground ozone arises when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people, and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered over Prut's surprising change of direction.
"It's worrying how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the person responsible for protecting the air we inhale," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
'we must continue to fight against the Trump administration's ideological crusade to pander to polluters and their special interests. '

Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church is invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 pm to a serenade.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the resort, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be captivated by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village has made the friends and patrons of Tumlingens their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique village treasure."
In 1267 the St. Hilary Chapel was mentioned for the first time in the official record book of Württemberg: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church on it to Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard of Horb and to his brother Dietrich Silver.
According to the text of the document, apart from the former parish church, the Tumlinger Berg also had a splendid courtyard, to which the church or the patronage law belonged, and not the other way round.
So people also lived there.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt in 1858, next to the lower village and the upper village, which can still be seen today in the village of Tumlingen, the "mountain" was the third, the splendid settlement centre of the village.
Old maps from the time around the year 1600 underpin these historical facts.
The right of patronage arose from the early medieval church law.
A gentleman who built, furnished and occupied a church with a priest remained the owner of this church and was also able to inherit this church.
Associated with this was the right to appoint a priest or to propose to the bishop a new pastor.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The older of the two crumbled at Christmas 1673.
The newly created bell was first heard in 1692, but had to be delivered later in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the windows were smashed and the bells were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius Cemetery also served as the final resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilary church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower dwarf, which still exists today, was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are cultivating the Hilarius plant from the "creative pensioners" in place of Dieter Dockhorn.
As the organizer, the friends and sponsors invite Tumlingens on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade in the old cemetery to the St. Hilary Chapel.
It is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The programme starts at 4.30 p.m.
Admission is from 3.30 pm.
At the end of the Serenade a drink takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows towards the forest," the organisers point out the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is important for tumblers and audiobooks.
The friends and sponsors of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini affirms.
Association wants to have approval of wind turbines examined
"Boisheim resists" does not see any legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat.
The "Boisheim Resistance" association has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its permit for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette.
It was carried out illegally.
The association argues that, at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved at all in the Boisheimer Nette, as at the time in Viersen a wind power concentration zone existed only at the city border to Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone excludes the use of wind energy for the rest of the urban area.
Such zones are intended to prevent a "saving" of the landscape.
The city of Viersen had adopted a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette by amending the land-use plan a few days earlier - but it had not been approved by the district government of Düsseldorf due to a formal error.
"Due to the lack of a planning requirement, the granted approval decision is still unlawful and can therefore also be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim resist."
Current state of affairs: Before the summer recess, the city council has once again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; approval of the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "This means that planning permission for the construction of wind turbines is excluded at this point."
The circle confirms the receipt of the invitation.
"The relevant letters have been received by Viersen County since last week," a spokesman said.
The circle takes it as an opportunity to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not expected to lead to the proceedings being stopped.
In view of ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the district on Thursday did not wish to comment on the content of the argument of the association "Boisheim resists."
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans to build four wind turbines, each 200 metres high, on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.
Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had already signed leases with the owner of the 65-hectare site.
The construction of the four wind turbines is expected to meet the electricity needs of around 11,400 households - equivalent to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four households.
NEW Re plans to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen City Council gave the go-ahead for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen, as well as a stake in a wind turbine at Übach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district.
'it belongs to us, it's our future, 'he added after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of association therefore does not merely serve to circumvent legal hurdles that might arise in the course of registration in court - it is also a political strategy.

City and retailers plan "home shopping" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to lure the inhabitants to the city centre for shopping.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend is intended to sensitize customers about the offers their own city offers away from the usual supermarket merchandise.
A market is planned with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies will present themselves with their apprenticeships.
In addition, the shops of the city centre are to invite for "midnight shopping."
The action was not only aimed at residents of the city and the surrounding region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an internet video and printed bags that point to the weekend of action, according to Christian König.
The city administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce.
This will take the trade association and the city to another stage of the project "Attractive city centre."
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" at the Brunnenfest and Sunday sales, talks with all traders and hosts to encourage them to take an active part.
Attractive offers for Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are also part of the concept.
In addition, customer potentials are to be tapped or re-tapped.
This includes spa guests and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost sight of the city centre while shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to contribute to revitalizing the inner city - up to landlords, the businesses of the whole city and clubs.
It was a matter of using a network to overcome lethargy, which had partly spread, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian cities were taking part for the first time in the third "home-shopping" day in Germany.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and emphasize its importance for the common good of our cities," he said.
The campaign led by the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also made it clear that every citizen with his or her buying behaviour can influence his or her immediate environment.

Trump put Mexico under pressure after leaked transcripts of phone calls over payment of border wall
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US president insulted him because he had publicly denounced the wall. According to reports, he said to him, "You can't tell the press that."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the US southern border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the U.S. to take refugees who emigrated to Australia was "ridiculous," "mies" and "stupid" and that insisting on trade mediated by the Obama administration would make him look like a "dump" after he proposed a ban on relocating refugees to the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended the call after telling Mr. Turnbull that "this is the most awkward call for the whole day."
I was led to a tavern, where the conductor asked me to sit down to dine; however, as I had no appetite, he left me alone in a large room, at both ends of which there was a fireplace; a chandelier hung from the ceiling, and on top of a small gallery.
And all this you see by the appearance of an oil lamp hanging from the ceiling, and that of a bright fireplace, by which I sit in coat and hat; my muff and umbrella lie on the table, and I try to recover from the warmth of the stove, and the duckling,
After walking along the long, carpets-covered gallery, I descended the glossy bare oak staircase; then I came into the hall; here I stood still for a minute; I looked at some copper sticks on the walls, - still today I remember the one carved a bronze in a casing.
She climbed down from her chair and came up to me to sit on my lap; then she seriously folded her little hands, threw her curls back, pinned her eyes on the ceiling of the room, and began to sing a melody from any opera.
It was a large, stately compartment, with purple-colored furniture and curtains, a Turkish carpet, softwood-clothed walls, a large colorful window and a richly carved ceiling.
I still see her in her raging passion when we had driven her to the extreme - she spilled our tea, crumbled our butter bread, threw our books up to the ceiling, and made a colourful mess with the ruffle and the writing desk, the camouflage and the fire rod.
Right, and faster than she expected: Before she had half drowned out the bottle, she felt her head pushed to the ceiling, and had to bend down quickly so as not to break her neck.
Through the cracks of the wood, the sun's rays stared at the tiles with long thin needles, or they broke down at the edges of the furniture and swirled up to the ceiling.

The interior of the hut was just as derelict as the old one; its walls whitewashed, the beams of the ceiling blackened, the fireplace collapsed, spiny weaves hung on all corners; in the middle stood a row of wobbly tables and crumpled a child, sitting in the basement.

A crowd of the most diverse people - no one cared for the incoming - filled a medium-sized, two-storey room, which was just below the ceiling surrounded by a gallery, which was also completely occupied, and where people could only stand adorned and hit the ceiling with head and back.
But it was not she who was circling, but the man, who had pulled his mouth wide and looked at the ceiling.
Although there was no direct access to light, it was not completely dark, because some departments had a wooden grid stretching against the corridor to instead of uniform board walls, though reaching up to the ceiling, through which some light penetrated and through which individual officials could see how they were writing at tables or watching through the corridors.
Especially on top of the ceiling he liked to hang; it was quite different from lying on the floor; one breathed more freely; a slight swinging went through the body; and in the almost happy dispersion in which Gregory was up there, it could happen that he let go and clapped on the floor to his own surprise.

Moores Ford massacre: Activists reintroduce racist lynching as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, rummaging towards Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped out to block its path.
The mob's leader - a middle-aged man in a needle patrol suit - took a long train at his cigar and looked through the windshield, examining it.
Inside, the inmates were hovering in fear.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" The man roared.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams tore the silence when a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Luckily, this horrific scene, which was played on July 22, is just a follow-up.
But when a noose is then thrown around the neck of "Roger," almost everyone in the audience threw out very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have been coming back to Moore's Ford Bridge to emulate the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged over the murders.
"It's really unfathomable that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the follow-up.
'it's a dirt on a story, but it's a burden on our souls. '
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the replica serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want law enforcement, we want termination, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need to get justice," he said.
"We cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A forensic doctor lays a bed sheet over the corpse of one of the victims of the Moore Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI records obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process.
But none has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say the double motivation for the Lynch actions has always been known throughout the city: Politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer's pre-election campaign.
At about the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farmer Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumour in the city had been that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was escorted to the prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they then moved away from the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the killings," an FBI report concludes.
'it's also obvious that there was a plot between state and local law enforcement, which was not only involved in the murders, removed evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses. '
Brooks formulates it even more succinctly.
"It was a right-to-vote massacre," he said.
"They were all killed for sending a message to black people in this community:" If you register and if you vote, then this will happen to you here. "
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has spearheaded the annual rendition of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Her portrayal is vivid, poignant and is grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynching because then we are confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said.
'but I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through. '
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched a well-reviewed review of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is Greenes's co-director here.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never get easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Marbaugh said.
'but I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to go back to these times. '
On the other side of the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcom shouting at Hester and harassing him, angry that he has slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- er, disappear from my property!"
Rascona reciprocates the fire.
There is a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) erupts into laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!" Rascona asked.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still chuckling.
"I just don't think white people said 'n --- he' at the time."
"Yes," joked one of the other black performers.
'you just have to hit the hard 'R.'. '
And that's exactly where the energy shifts in the room, a feeling of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely no one is laughing.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman, clothed with a funeral dress, stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holidays's grieving eulogy "Strange Fruit."
Her voice breaks at every second word.
About a hundred meters behind, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple has arrived from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just coming down the street.
They have all experienced Georgia's oppressive moisture for almost eight hours, when Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the killings have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels ghostly.
When the last notes of the song come to an end, Greene invites the crowd to get closer and inspect the corpses.
Children sit at their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy mumbles, as if he wanted to remember it.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynching rope and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his fellow players and then breaks down crying in her arms, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaking through with him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
'we know that's not in your heart.
You've done that for a reason. '
Later, the audience sits down with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chatted excitedly about the rendition with a black couple they've just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words about what feeling the performance has left behind.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and actions... coming from people who look like yourself and who do that because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me makes me believe that the lynching is still going on," she added, "today this is just called police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks Court holds on to his table, he eats and recalls the civil rights.
He said he had already started planning the performance next year.
"The aftermath is inspiring in a way, because it describes the horror of what we endured, but it's also a moment of learning," he said.
'it's like, if we don't learn anything from it, then it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, those who do not know their own history, are condemned to repeat it. "
"Götterdämmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf puts on a colorful-frivolous staging in front of gigantic, six-storey backdrops.
The rotary stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows a shabby street corner with a wall rest and embellishment in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elaste" logo from East German times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes classic car is parked, in which the Rhine daughters pose as rock stars, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's leitmotiv - money, power and greed - which runs through his "ring" staging.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize as they did in the "Rheingold" marvellous.
Kess seduce her Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), dragging a corpse into the trunk in Hollywood style and giving the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the gloriously feathery hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he shot Siegfried.
Later on, Gunther (Mark's oak) has to believe in it.
The audience would like to thank the ensemble with loud applause.
Tempestuously celebrated are Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who humbly bows his hands to the Merkel-Raute.
There is great applause for the festival orchestra, which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in empty casual clothing.
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his team of directors was eagerly awaited.
Had he still had to endure a glowing pipe concert in 2013, five years later there were great cheers in which the isolated "buh" cries went down.
Festival director Katharina Wagner should have been pleased about this.
"You realize that the audience has grown together with the" ring "in a way," she had said shortly before the dpa's performance.
The audience had not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but also an understanding of his view had grown.
I draw a positive conclusion.
Almost everyone -- except companies like ExxonMobil or U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney and their bought-in henchmen and misguided henchmen -- understands that carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere when people burn hydrocarbons, and that the CO2 there acts like a huge blanket that absorbs the infra-radiation from below.
Sufficient brightness, good contrast, freedom of movement and reflection of the screen surface as well as high resolution and correct dimensioning of the signs are important for the readability of the display.
The finer the resolution of the screen, i.e., the more "image points" per character are available, the better the readability of the information becomes.

They do not include remote sensing images with full resolution at this stage, although some samples of lower quality are available.
The five basic properties that describe the ground cover (wood-like, grass-like, bald soil, artificial (buildings), water) can easily be determined with Earth observation data (both low and high resolution) over large areas for mapping purposes.
This option has allowed the creation of a high-quality card base, with an expected geometric accuracy of 2.5 m (RMS) and a resolution of 1m.
In this case, with a geometric resolution of 1m, each point can be clearly located, with the exception of objects whose resolution would be less than 1 meter.
The above rule of thumb must be revised if the geometric resolution of the image is low, that is, if a considerable proportion of the objects whose surface one wants to estimate is lost due to the presence of mixed pixels.
On the other hand, in the field of agrometeorological models and methods for vegetation monitoring with medium-resolution satellites, there is still a great deal of development and research work to be done.
At present, GEOSTAT's geographic information system not only contains grid and point data with a resolution of 1 ha, but also various vector files. In addition to project organization and management, the GEOSTATproject comprises two project units: The service unit and the computer group.
Integration, management and maintenance of various geocoded, spatially relevant data available in the Swiss Federal Administration; this data shall cover the entire country and have a spatial resolution of 100 m, which corresponds to a scale of 1: 25 000;
Data on the surface development of a smaller number of land-use categories (possibly 20 or less) with a smaller spatial resolution and accuracy could be published 1 or 2 times a year to fill the data gap created by the fact that the realm statistics can only be compiled every 12 years on the basis of aerial images.
The remote sensing provides the data according to geometric meshes of different sizes depending on the resolution of the sensor (pixels).
In addition to the characteristic program, the scale and the geometric resolution (the smallest different spatial unit), the nomenclature and the periodicity of the survey play a decisive role.
With regard to the selection of sample fields, however, it was shown in the first year of the investigation in 1990 that very small fields can hardly be made visible in the satellite image due to the relatively low geometric resolution of the currently available image material (LANDSAT TM: 30 m).
The calculations were initially based on six of the seven LANDSATrecordings spectral channels of July 1990 and April and July 1991; the thermal channel was excluded because it caused too many mixed pixels at the parcels due to its low resolution (120 m2).
However, the intended improvement of spectral resolution in LANDSAT 6 will in any case have a positive effect on the usability of smaller training fields.
Therefore, satellite images with a higher resolution (SPOT, LANDSATTM 6 with 15 - 15 m2) should be made available as soon as possible, and the inclusion of supplementary statistical and / or meteorological parameters in correlation calculations should ensure that the yield is sufficiently high and satisfactorily accurate.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, with the support of the ITA consortium, began in 1987 to carry out estimates of acreage and crop yields based on high geometric and spectral data, supplemented by sample data from land use surveys on 4,500 segments of 50 and 100 hectares.
A first attempt to combine this survey with satellite data took place in 1981 with a picture of Landsat MSS, but did not yield convincing results, which was attributed to the inadequate resolution of the MSS sensor.
It has also been established that regression estimation can be based on both piecemeal soil data and segments, provided that there is a satellite with sufficient resolution, with SPOT being more suitable for this area than Landsat TM.
A finer spatial resolution is necessary in order to be able to study effects on the environment.
Different applications in different geographical areas require different resolution and accuracy in the assessment of geophysical parameters.
For example, geostationary satellites can capture an area of a fifth of the Earth's surface in thirty minutes and provide images with a resolution of 5 or 2.5 km.
It mentions some of the problems encountered in the project, including the difficulty of obtaining consistent multitemporary data, the problem of developing a consistent and generally accepted classification, as well as the limitations of the mash and the resolution of other data sets with which land use data must be combined.
PC with Pentium 100 MHz (minimum) - 16 MB RAM (minimum) - CD-ROM drive with quadruple speed (minimum) - 15 MB free space on the hard drive - screen: Super VGA, 256 colours (resolution 640 ″ 480) - Windows 95.
The quality of post-radiation examinations has been improved by the development of a method by which high resolution micro-adiographies can be produced by irradiated shell grains.
The resolution of REM is about 20 nm, the upper limit here is at least 1000 micrometers.
The main obstacle to traditional televisions is bandwidth: With conventional telephone lines, it is still difficult to transmit an image of good resolution with a sufficiently high repetition frequency to really give the impression of movement.
The image receptor developed by IMEC provides a better resolution in the center of the image (according to the fovea) than at its edge (retina), using a very limited number (8013) at pixels.
With the EISS browser, images can be found and viewed at a low resolution.
Equipped with the right signal converter, any TV device purchased today can receive digital programs, but not with the high resolution.
BARON's stereoscopic projection table shows crystal-clear images of high-resolution computer work stations and PC graphics cards.
The resulting demand led to the development of CCD color image devices with high resolution.
However, many users use the range of IVP products from slower resolution devices.
Spa has high resolution, low time constant, easy compatibility with computer control and the ability to function within a wide temperature range
As a mechatronic device, the SPA-Effek-tor / sensor offers some desirable characteristics such as high resolution, low time constant, easy compatibility with computer control and the ability to function within a wide temperature range and is suitable for developing intelligent mechanisms.
The correlation spectrometers use correlation technology to improve the resolution otherwise limited by the specifically long reactor pulse.
The centrepiece of the project is "MGW," a "smart media streaming server" that allows content to be distributed on separate networks where the audio / video bit rate, resolution and format are altered.
The Space Apphcations Institute, a member of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), has published a report outlining a new methodology for mapping Europe's forests using a very high resolution Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer.
The measuring device is based on the application of a superreel sensor with a corresponding spatial resolution, which is potentially supplemented by an infrared sensor with a lower resolution;
This will be the first time that such a "snapshot" of planet Earth has been compiled in terms of resolution and coverage.
The themes of the projects presented were: Ways to support Altimetri in predicting climate change, monitoring marine pollution, use of Earth observation to assess the health of European forests, the PELCOM project, which aims to create an "up-to-date" map of Europe with a dissolution of 1 km, assessment of the impact of the ozone.
The data should be obtained on the basis of the outputs of meteorological models and low-resolution satellite data.
The third lot involves the management of a processing chain for low-resolution satellite data.
Operation of the MARS de data include data derived from a global circulation model, satellite data with low resolution and derived products; mapping and provision of results; updating of the associated MARS database.
Siemens looked at data quality, as fixed models require a much higher resolution and accuracy than normal scans.
Finally, it has commissioned the École Nationale Supérieure de Physique de Strasbourg (ENSPS) to develop a high-speed memory card that can store 2000 images with the full resolution of 512 or 512 pixels.
The dissolution of this vectorial equation according to the coordinates leads to the accelerations acting in x, y and z directions.
An excerpt from a measuring letter is shown in Figure 43, where the signal frequency, once with high resolution, is recorded two times.
One advantage of empirical rather than teoretic determination of categories is that it is thus possible to determine their general applicability and reliability in the resolution of ambiguities in real texts.
The resolution takes place again in the source language; if simultaneously translated into several languages, individual meanings can only be entered into these programs at certain points.
This could lead to an increase in the resolution of the ultrasound examination.
For reasons of higher accuracy (higher resolution) in the simulation on the hybrid calculator and the uniform standardisation of the entire road for any cut-off plan, the coefficients of the linear rolling road model for deviations were calculated and multiplied with factors for an amplitude standard.
A full volume reduction with a high resolution radar device (such as the one in Chilbolton) would take too long.
Of these data, those with the low resolution (10 s) were only used to study long durations (greater than 32 s), while those with the high resolution were used to describe the process as a whole.
The deficiencies that exist there, such as insufficient resolution and too long response times, are currently a major obstacle to the inclusion of certain information relevant to innovation in databases.
The IRSID (47) research project uses a new generation of X-ray radiation detectors with photo-diode lines, which allows the simultaneous recording of a large number of measuring points with the same accuracy but with a finer resolution than with existing measuring devices.
However, the use of the new resolution has the advantage that the differences in surface temperature over the length of the flowed absorbers can now be seen.
The dissolution of this model of price flexibility is achieved by balancing supply and demand.
The dissolution of the model leads us to establish three marginal quotas.
The improvement of non-destructive methods with high spatial and temporal resolution that characterize, for example, bioactive interfaces (structure, function, stability) and the design of miniaturised transformers for devices based on biological function.
The possibility of coupling images of high and low resolution, which were simultaneously recorded by the same platform, allows a much more accurate analysis.
A zoom effect with high resolution and the same spectral bands make it possible to describe each point of the image better.
The radiometric resolution has been adapted to measure the differences caused by soil growth - and not just the large contrasts that meteorologists need.
Using images with low resolution (1 km) from the NOAA (National Océanography and Atmospheric Administration) weather observation satellites, the JRC has developed a map of all the Earth's tropical forests.
This assessment was only possible due to several technological developments in the field of radar wave probes (microwave probes) with low spatial resolution.
Their aim is to follow the development of tropical forests almost simultaneously through the combined use of images with both low and high resolution.
The high-resolution images then make it possible to analyse the affected region in detail and to precisely determine the size of the existing forest areas.
A new species Sonar • In the field of marine technology and within the framework of the project ACID (Acoustic Imaging Development) a new generation of sonars has been developed, the peculiarity of which is that they provide images whose resolution is independent of the distance between the detector and the target object.
(Resolution by the Annual General Meeting)
By scanning documents, the contents of paper pages can be stored as a computer file containing an image of the source document with a specific resolution.
The resolution of a scanner is expressed in "dots per inch" (dpi).
Colour scanners can currently easily reach a resolution of 300 or 600 dpi.
The resolution of a fax scanner is much lower (100 to 200 dpi).
Due to the low resolution and poor print quality, it is often difficult to apply optical drawing recognition for faxes.
Henning T. rips two cables from the stereo, knotts them to a noose and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
It called on governments in the region to commit to sustainable land use and installations that are not at the expense of South East Asia's natural resources, mainly forests.
Some investors seem to be betting on safe investments such as gold.
On average, investors in Europe hold more than 34 percent of short-term investments, compared with 14 percent in the US.
Short-term investments in Europe are weighted more than twice as much.
Especially for small countries like Switzerland, where the possibilities of scattering investments and the selection of securities are limited due to the size of the domestic capital market, the securities investment abroad is of great importance.
In recent years, the economy has benefited greatly from global demand for U.S. assets, especially debt in the form of securities that financed a large current account deficit.
The entire financial universe - investment and trade - has been increasingly covered for 100 years like hardly any other financial market:
In the past, sustainable investment was primarily about filtering out assets in "poorly regarded" industries such as alcohol, weapons and tobacco.
Investments of this kind, as well as investments or cash reserves, form the active side.
What about the currency risk - should investments be hedged?
In a broad comparison, we therefore assume that the risk / return ratio of investments in the emerging markets will improve in the future.
Investment guru Jim Rogers once said that, at a plant in the emerging markets, the best thing would be to buy what the emerging markets themselves buy, namely raw materials.
A new era of sustainable systems
First approaches only excluded installations in "scapegoats" such as alcohol, weapons or tobacco.
At Credit Suisse, we define sustainable investment as the explicit recognition that environmental, social, and governance factors can influence the ability of companies to generate long-term returns.
Our research methodology for sustainable investments begins with an analysis of sustainability opportunities and risks, which can fundamentally influence a company's ability to secure its profitability.
Why do sustainable plants and sustainably managed companies receive so much more public attention today than they did ten years ago?
As a result of disasters such as Fukushima or Deepwater Horizon, investors are asking how their investments affect the environment and society.
Due to the market turbulence of recent times, the awareness for sustainable investments has also gained in importance.
Do you assume that the trend towards sustainable investments will remain limited to purely niche areas such as environmental technology, or will the consideration of ESG criteria become a permanent trend among investors worldwide?
We want to offer investors our know-how in the field of sustainable investments, play a visible and important role in this and at the same time participate in the constant growth in this area.
In investment and banking products, in the consulting process, in the instruments we offer and - most importantly - in our employees, "adds Pauli.
"Returns are important, no question," explains Pauli, "but good advice, including a clear rationale that speaks for or against an investment, is just as significant."
"Investing has become a very complex matter," explains Nicole Pauli, "and at some point, product specialists are required who have specific, detailed knowledge of a plant."
For example, asset management specialists in funds and alternative investments, investment bankers for strategic choices such as an IPO or merger, and private banking consultants for the management of private assets.
For example, the value investing goes to Benjamin Graham and David Dodd and their investment standard "Security Analysis," published in 1934 (in German):
Speaking to John Maynard Keynes, supporters of the Contrarian strategy take the following view: "A basic principle of investing is to oppose the prevailing opinion, because if everyone agrees on the merits of an investment, it is necessarily too expensive and therefore unattractive."
On the one hand, the once again increased risk aversion in view of the debt problems in Greece and Spain would speak in favour of a flight into safe investments.
On the other hand, from the perspective of a foreign investor, an investment in Swiss francs would represent a diversification in the portfolio.
In addition, cash flows into indexed products find themselves on a relatively illiquid market, forcing investors from passively managed mandates into investments at a yield level that we consider to be unsustainable.
The true dimension was revealed when the Bank published its results for the third quarter of 2011: The new Basel III rules had more than doubled risk-weighted assets (RWA) in investment banking, largely due to fixed-income assets.
The lack of investment alternatives and the high level of liquidity in investors' deposits around the world also speak in favour of investing in equities.
One makes a decision (buys a plant) and hopes for a positive effect (wants to achieve a return).
It is a measure of the yield fluctuations of a plant around its mean value.
Instruments at very low risk, such as most money market investments, receive one, while very risky investments, such as options, receive a five.
This is particularly important in view of the currently very unusual market environment for fixed income plants, which is characterised by exceptionally low yields and a lack of supply of safe installations.
An investment in convertible bonds is an option for investors who want to share in the potential of equity markets but are not willing to bear all the associated risks.
Many founders are also looking for ways to convert part of their corporate assets into liquid assets and diversify them into unsecured and uncorrelated investments.
Long-term investments in the oil, mining, manufacturing and transportation sectors are more stable than the investments in stocks and bonds currently deducted from other emerging markets.
Responsible investments offer new opportunities
For example, the first comprehensive investment report from seven regions around the world from the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance (GSIA) of 2013 states that at least USD 13.6 trillion in professionally managed assets now apply so-called ESG criteria (environmental, social and governance considerations, environmental, social and governance criteria) to their selection and management.
This corresponds to around 22 percent of assets under management in these regions and shows that sustainable investments in the regions surveyed have reached a critical mass.
The final panel discussion focused on the central topic "impact investing," i.e. investments that, in addition to their financial returns, also bring about social and / or environmental improvements thanks to sustainable business growth.
Referring to the collapse of the Rana factory in Bangladesh in April 2013, which caused more than 1100 deaths and about 1000 serious injuries among the seamstresses employed there, Oliver Niedermaier explained that long-term investors such as sovereign wealth funds, Ultra High Net Worth individuals and pension institutions are particularly attractive:
Responsible Investment (RI) or Responsible Investment is an investment approach that integrates environmental, social and governance aspects (" Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations ") into the selection and management of investments.
We were able to raise funds quickly, especially for alternative plants, and now have to industrialize all processes - from marketing to sales.
Speaking of growth in alternative investment: What is the reason for this demand?
In my opinion, AM meets these requirements with its first-class products in the field of alternative and traditional systems as well as its strong multi-asset class solutions business.
How do you ensure a sound investment and risk management process?
What does this mean in terms of facilities?
The new, hand-picked investment themes and ideas from Credit Suisse's Investment Strategy & Research team have been developed to help you get the most out of your investment in the second half of 2014.
Giles Keating, Head of Research, explains the reasoning behind the ideas and the impact of the plant.
"For example, European customers like to delegate their investments and often opt for asset management mandates.
The third factor could play a role, even though we do not have explicit government regulations on investments.
Life insurance companies such as pension funds, which have traditionally built heavily on fixed-income investments, face problems.
Given their risk profile, and also because of investment guidelines (BVG), it will be difficult for these investors to increase their share of higher-risk investments such as stocks or high-interest bonds.
As a result of this debt reduction, market participants are liquidating their emerging-market assets.
Stock exchanges are now owned by shareholders who expect a fair return on their investment.
The boom was triggered in 2001 by too little real estate supply, significant employment growth, an expansionist monetary policy and the trend of households shifting their investments from equities to residential real estate.
In addition to traditional direct investment, there is a whole range of alternatives that avoid possible disadvantages of such an investment, such as low liquidity and lack of transparency.
Simply put, I decide whether we invest more in bonds, shares, cash or alternative investments, as well as allocating various sub-asset categories such as loans, hedge funds or private equity, such as regions, countries and styles, such as asset values (value stocks) or growth stocks.
Today he gives a number of possibilities to cover the megatrends "demographic developments," "multipolar world" and "sustainability" with a single system.
That would then be the right environment to deal intensively with plants that take these megatrends into account.
In fact, investment in countries with weaker economic growth has yielded high returns in the past.
The main investment theme for an investment in India is consumption, i.e. an investment in non-cyclical consumer goods, personal care products, electronic products, consumer goods such as cars and mobile phones, or luxury goods.
For each profile it is specified in which bandwidths the bonds, the shares, the alternative investments and the currencies may move.
The American data give an approximate idea of the possible returns on investments in agricultural land.
Installations in agricultural land would have been a good admixture for most depots over the last two decades.
Only the right year of harvest makes a fine wine a good plant.
The report also provides valuable data for the important top-down analysis of investments and puts current market concerns about sovereign debt in the right context: It shows that the estimated $42 trillion of global public debt in 2009 is only one-fifth of the $195 trillion of global household wealth, "explained Keating.
At the same time, they open up interesting opportunities for investments in companies benefiting from this development.
The Danish entrepreneur and venture capitalist Morten Lund experienced this on his own when a position of his portfolio with more than 80 investments - the best known of which was the internet telephony and video software Skype - became worthless in 2009 and deprived him of all his assets.
The development of exclusive offerings has led to new structured products, tailor-made investments and new investment funds, such as a $750 million loan fund.
We can support customers in all areas - from pure wealth creation to the phase where they need complex solutions for investment and investment issues. "
"Our biggest competition in recent years has been passive installations," explains Küffer.
He was involved in two companies and had made some of his investments into money through an IPO of both companies.
"It has happened that we have advised an internationally listed company on mergers and capital markets and at the same time offered personal investment or financial advice to the family holding company," says Fleuriot.
In general, therefore, it is fair to say that, with the right advice and care, hedge fund investments are not necessarily more risky than traditional investments.
Alternative investments therefore remain an important part of any capital allocation.
Unlike in the 1990s, the minimum interest rate can no longer be achieved with an almost risk-free investment such as Swiss federal bonds.
However, the investment of the coupons and repayment amounts of the bonds at higher interest rates compensates for the loss of market value in the long term.
However, in times of negative real interest rates, it cannot be regarded as an adequate investment for the medium and long term, as the investor has to accept a real loss of assets.
Expanding the range of products and services in the fields of philanthropy, microfinance, sustainable investments and so-called "impact investing" could therefore open up interesting new business opportunities for Swiss banks.
Against the background of latent and difficult-to-predict structural inflationary pressures, however, we are already increasingly relying on real investments.
Real investment is one of the cornerstones of our investment strategy.
Economic progress, the generous provision of liquidity to central banks, the sustained favourable or appropriate assessment of riskier investments and the ongoing pressure to invest should continue to push the financial market pendulum in the direction of opportunities.
In the case of alternative plants, the right mix of these heterogeneous systems must be put together again.
In contrast to the euro or the dollar, there is still a positive return on risk-free investments in Swiss francs.
Should the States be offered a menu with only one dish or an à la carte meal?
Personally, I believe that the invention of the à la carte meal in comparison with the menu of a single dish, which corresponded to the eating habits of the barracks, represented a great step forward for civilisation.
"We merely point out how meals that make fat can be replaced by low-calorie yet tasty dishes."
In addition, some dishes are complete meals, while others consist exclusively of vegetables.
The protein / energy ratio recommended for dishes prepared with meat only (7 g per 100 kcal) is above the value of a fed beef half (5 g per 100 kcal), but is significantly lower than that for chicken, poultry and fish (15 g per 100 kcal).
Fruit juices (with or without added sugar), nectar (diluted fruit juice, usually with added sugar) and dishes consisting exclusively of fruit have long been part of the diet of the distilling infant throughout Europe.
The committee's recommendations allow for a slight increase in the natural carbohydrate content (up to a total value of 15 g per 100 ml in fruits and nectar and up to 20 g per 100g in a dish consisting only of fruit), which should make it possible to match the taste.
Changes in eating habits were also due to the explosive development of travel, mobility, the emergence of restaurants, among others, offering foreign dishes, as well as the increasing popularity of foreign food.
Paella The dish comes from the Spanish rice-growing area on the Mediterranean coast, the region of Valencia.
A few days later, when the same dish was presented to him again, he used his detector to detect ionizing radiation at that time, something completely new and tremendously impressive, and found that the food was radioactive.
He gave a bit of a radioactive substance to the food leftovers on his plate, and when he was presented with the same dish again, he used his radiation detector and found that the food was radioactive.
We also offer gluten-free alternatives and dishes for allergy sufferers. "
As a result, there is a great need for ready meals, which has led to the development of new food products and packaging such as TV dinners and pre-cooked dishes that are ready to eat or only need to be heated in the microwave.
Examples of products where these materials are already used are storage cabling dishes, snacks such as potato chips and peanuts, and also the ultralight "cross-shaped" vacuum packaging for coffee.
Within a generation our food has become more varied and diverse - we eat food and dishes from all over Europe and all over the world.
In each school, the most successful dishes were awarded, and these recipes were published in the journal "Ha Kuriren."
She learned how to prepare Italian dishes, especially desserts, with fresh local ingredients.
If you like to travel this way, however, you must first find these wonderful places, be sure to get a good reception there and taste authentic regional dishes.
Guests were able to enjoy traditional Finnish dishes based on reindeer, salmon and caviar, as well as Finnish beers.
The event, which was held under the patronage of the President and the Secretary General of the EESC and organised in the Committee in cooperation with Hervé COUPEAU (Group III - Various Interests), representatives of young farmers in France and the French overseas departments, featured typical products and specialities from Martinique and Guadelouche.
If you then add a little flexibility and freedom, so that a group of dishes can exchange with each other, you may even achieve an even higher degree of satisfaction.
Max crowd works as a volunteer
They work in several places during their volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Crowd: Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture store, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I have already worked at the school in the open day.
What are your experiences with this?
Crowd: It's a nice, broad spectrum that I see here.
I have to deal with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
They are now 26 years, so a late-career volunteer.
How come?
Crowd: I did baccalaureate.
And then a civil engineering degree, let's say, successfully canceled.
I realized for myself that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else, work with people.
And then I asked myself, what are you doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it really is on the spot, in the focal point perhaps also.
And was it?
Crowd: I've collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in the social sciences in the winter semester.
I will study on a dual basis, probably do a social worker training in Herne and study in Hamm at the university of applied sciences.
Isn't it a little unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service?
Crowd: Yes, it's very variable.
It probably always depends on where you do your FSJ.
You can do it from retirement home to youth work - in all sorts of facets of social work.
With me it was very diverse.
I was also partly in the OGS, that is, in the afternoon care.
For me, that was just the right thing that irritated me.
I could recognise my own strengths and see how it really works out.
Unlike in civil engineering studies?
Crowd: Of course, this is not about calculating statistics.
You always have other people in front of your head, who each have a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, whether a youth who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no touching fears?
Crowd: I'm not the guy for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
Lots of love, lots of kindness.
There are sometimes negative moments, but that's how life is.
But the planning of the invasion of Iraq, in which Rumsfeld advocated the deployment of fewer troops than proposed, suggests a lack of understanding of distributed systems.
Those who wanted to limit the use of jurors apparently feared a risk to state security in some cases.
Almost three billion went down in the budget for various reparations for victims of communism and crime, or for expenses for litigation, even for construction savings.
Local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two US counter-terrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
The first two victims were seriously injured hospitalized, where the eighties-year-old died.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, once again called for the criminal proceedings to be set aside.
As far as we know, Werner Söllner is not only a perpetrator, but also a victim.

Mario Monti, Italy's future head of government, has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program calling for "sacrifices" to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
If France were to decide to phase out nuclear power, a large proportion of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and the annual EUR 6 billion in exports of capital goods and nuclear energy would shrink more and more.
My group takes a particularly positive view of the fact that the development initiated by this House's rejection of the budget has now been translated into an incipient resolution of the problems.
Time and again, however, there is evidence of forces leading to a dissolution, despite the fact that EuroPilot, the organisation of European pilots, says that Eurocontrol is the solution to European air traffic control.
The resolution by the Committee on Transport draws attention to the urgent case of Eurocontrol and calls for its dissolution to be avoided, or at least for its specific, albeit limited, functioning to be maintained.
What is the Commission's assessment of the recent dissolution of political parties in Turkey by the military junta?
Europe is changing in our eyes, but, and this should be emphasised, with the result of the disintegration and destruction not only of the area, but also of the family, culture and society: This is the Europe of indifference, not the Europe of peoples.
I believe it is essential to prevent further proliferation of nuclear weapons as a result of the dissolution of the former Soviet Union.
The question that arises, however, is whether the separation, the dissolution will end the conflicts or whether they will continue in the light of the new geopolitical connections that are now forming, which will scarcely allow a peaceful life in the Balkans.
The dangers of the spread of technology and technical know-how for the production of (nuclear, chemical, biological) weapons of mass destruction have increased significantly after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
Their despair is the result of the dissolution of Yugoslavia and the failure of the heads responsible to agree on how the peoples of the former Yugoslavia should live together.
It is also otherwise foggy when it says that, following the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, other institutions could be dissolved.
You are basically asking the Community the question: Deepening into a federal state or dissolving into a free-trade area?
Unfortunately, however, the developments so far, following the overthrow of the socialist camp and the dissolution of the USSR, the statements by the representatives of NATO and America, the blatant attacks or interventions against independent states, demonstrate the importance of the character and objectives of any kind of conversion of the arms industry and the military sites.
But this is no wonder: No country on earth, not even the richest and most developed Western country, could have withstood the sudden drop in its own trade by 85 percent, as happened in Cuba with the dissolution of COMECON.
His dissolution of parliament, dismissal of the judges and provisional repeal of the constitution, his imprisonment of a large number of people and, of course, his ban on the free press - much of it is not only questionable when it comes to a democracy, but directly illegal.
B3 - 002 / 94 - 0 - 278 / 93) by Mr Moran López and others to the Commission on the dissolution of the Gibraltar Social Insurance Fund.
There is no doubt that the dissolution of a number of African states, including Somalia, Liberia and Burundi, mentioned by Hen Pons Grau in his report, together with the social and economic destabilisation which ultimately led to civil wars, played a crucial role in increasing the number of refugees.
Firstly, because we must not confuse the 'integration' of the Member States into the Community or the Union with their 'dissolution' in the same.
Perhaps things could have changed from the beginning, from the hasty dissolution of Yugoslavia; many sides, including the European Community, share responsibility for the current situation - divisions, war, ethnic cleansing, national homogenisation, intolerance, territorial conquest, even more obvious.
After the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, these countries are seeking the path to democracy and a social market economy.
In light of the political events following this signature, and in particular the dissolution of the Kazakh Parliament by President Nazarbaiev, our Parliament was forced to suspend the ratification procedure for this agreement until parliamentary elections were held.
There are disturbing reports of experiments carried out on people in Ukraine after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
A strengthening of Europe is not possible through its dissolution.
These include the immediate dissolution of the military and civilian repressive apparatus, the prosecution of the paramilitaries, an end to impunity and compensation for the victims.
The Commission endorses the conclusions of the Vienna Summit, which provide for the disarmament and disbanding of these militias and the sending of a United Nations mission to ease tensions.

- the EU recognised the new States resulting from the dissolution of the Soviet Union (the Baltic States in September 1991), Yugoslavia (Slovenia and Croatia in January 1992, Bosnia-Herzegovina in April 1992 and Macedonia in 1995) and Czechoslovakia (the Czech Republic and Slovakia in January 1993);
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, it rearranged its relations with the parliaments of the new countries and formed four separate delegations: With Russia, with Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, with the three Transcaucasian republics and with the Central Asian republics (including Mongolia).

The maintenance and consolidation of parliamentary democracy was therefore always the basic theme of the work of the EZPWD in the 1980s, which increased in importance after the disintegration of the communist regimes and the dissolution of the Eastern bloc in 1989 (meeting of correspondents in London, 1989).

Termination; termination of a company which precedes or follows the liquidation of the company, i.e. the sale of the company's assets, the satisfaction of its creditors and the distribution of the remaining assets among its shareholders.
The object of this analysis is the relocation of the "seat" - as it is called in the problem - of a union without dissolution.
The addition "without dissolution" makes it clear that these are the rules of private international law which determine which law is applicable to a society and whether a society is to be regarded as a legally established legal person.
The present investigation confines itself to the question of whether the rules of the Member States in the field of company law and private international law should be harmonised in such a way as to allow companies to transfer their actual registered office to another Member State without dissolution.
(1) the law governing a company; (2) the amendment of the law governing a company; (3) the possibility of transferring the administrative seat of a company without dissolution from the founding state; (4) the possibility of transferring its administrative seat to another Member State while maintaining the company's legal personality.
This requires the dissolution of the society in the country of departure and the establishment of the new member state.
However, the case law does not allow, in all Member States applying the seat theory, a company to change its administrative seat without dissolution into another
In some Member States this would lead to the dissolution of the company, namely:
In all Member States, a company may transfer its administrative seat within the jurisdiction of the State concerned without dissolution.
(1) Companies should be able to transfer their administrative seat, i.e. their actual seat, to another Member State without dissolution.
(2) Companies shall be entitled, on the basis of the freedom of establishment, to transfer their actual seat without dissolution (subject to the rules applicable in the Member States for reasons of transport protection).
This represents a step backwards for those Member States that apply the seat theory and allow the transfer of seats without dissolution.
The country of departure may only delete such registrations on the basis of the proof of the dissolution of the company in accordance with the legislation of a Member State which governs the company.

Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it will cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 per cent as another restructuring programme is launched to overcome the pressure facing the company.
The job cuts, which Director-General John Fallon mostly announced for late 2018 and early 2019, come on top of his previous restructuring, which has already lost 4,000 jobs.
Pearson announced a cost-cutting plan for another £300 million ($394 million) in a third cost-cutting programme in May to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which divested its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said its outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it posted a 1 percent increase to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing a Nato soldier and injuring several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a Nato statement said.
Unconfirmed local reports said that three civilians also died in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest act of violence to hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A Nato statement says the explosion happened on Thursday night when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an "improvised explosive device worn by persons." "
The statement says that all the injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital on the Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group, known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh, is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out that attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's deadliest militant attack since U.S.-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs in to increase the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The US Environmental Protection Agency has overturned a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration, which requires states to curb smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency for the move.
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to push ahead with the so-called "ozone provisions 2015" and said it showed the agency's commitment to working with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.

The EPA's website says that inhaling air that contains ozone can "reduce lung function and amplify respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.

Before the discussion there is an important information: The purchase contract for the missing piece of land has been signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will take some time until the area previously belonging to the parish is in municipal ownership, there is now no longer any obstacle to planning the project to be undertaken by a private investor.
For this there is a discussion about a Community area.
One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to accommodate the community.
On the ground floor, it would provide a living space - around 55 square metres - and an adjoining terrace with as much as 70 square metres of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council would like to see such a communal space not just as a meeting place for the inhabitants of the seniors, but open into the community.
As an example, the word "knitting café" made the rounds.
Funding opportunities will sweeten the decision, which was already pre-decided last autumn by the provision of funds for the current budget.
The construction is in the refurbishment area.
Setting up a community space would be eligible, reports Tjaden, with 60 percent of 30 percent.

It sees behind it a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.

So there are two votes against the original programme, which sums up Stefan Haller as follows: "If we take the decision like this, we will take a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure."

Walking in the resin from star to star
The first "star path" is to be created in the resin.
This is planned by the association Observatory St. Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" meets the information needs of many resin visitors, it said.
It combines nature, science, movement and athletic performance.
The members want to set up panels along the planned route and then inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "easy-to-reach installations in five to six places" in the Oberharz.
These could be St Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the panels will be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the choice of location.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the star path is to be extended by train.
"On the star path, viewers learn a lot worth knowing, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
They also learned why stars have different colors or why one star shines more strongly than another, even though it is much further away.
It is also conveyed in which constellation a selected star is and when it is best to be seen.
The association has been operating the highest observatory in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg since 2014.
According to the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation, the site in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany.
From there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy can often be seen clearly with the naked eye.
Since 2003, on the initiative of the funding association Planetarium Göttingen, there has been something similar in the university city to the planned star dwarf - the planetary path.
Starting in front of Gebhardt's hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its steles leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "alien" location in Diemarden (village equals) with the planet Sedna.
The steles with the individual planets - including the dwarf planet-degraded Pluto at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth thus shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimetres in diameter, while the sun, which is exactly 75 metres away, measures 70 centimetres.
The total distance of the planetary path is a good four kilometers.
While the light from sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to get to the stele with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in space.

And he needs to move to lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans demand.
Let's give them that. '
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy Lomachenko must fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also has interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares lightweight Luke Campbell on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans have asked for it," Garcia said, later openly expressing a desire to fight at the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready... "
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter," and he will possibly take part in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko paused at the lavish praise for Garcia and said that he thinks the three-fight champion from Riverside look "very slow, sorry Mikey... you wanted the co-op, yes."
Garcia said the focus was to show batting, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum that was building up for their own struggle.
"This is the fight that needs to be carried out.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it, "Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight. "
Four injured after puncture
Four people were partially seriously injured in an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira probably lost control of his vehicle at around 4.30 p.m. shortly before the market-wide connection point after a tyre burst.
The car hurled to the right into the embankment, where it overflowed and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were partly seriously injured in the accident.
During the initial rescue service for the injured, the A7 was blocked in the direction of the north for about an hour, after which the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site.
This is also good advice on land, but it is all the more important under water because of the poor light conditions.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Triple chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes that after the 2: 2 on the season opener against Braunschweig, the optimization of the defensive formation in Aue will bring points.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first game of the season, also with the result, if there had not been the two opposites in the 2: 2 against Brunswick.
"These were two opposites too many, and we have to be even more careful in Aue," says Fortuna Düsseldorf's defensive player.
In the Erzgebirge, the triangle is also to be further optimized.
And a gate after a free-throw, the Fortune don't want to capture any more.
"For the future, there will be no one standing on the line next to Michael (Rensing)."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will also be able to cope better with the treble chain after the experiences in the preparation than with the quadruple chain.
"I don't know yet how we will act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his thing, "because we just have players in the triple chain at the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build well," Hoffmann said.
"The prerequisite is, however, that we harmonize even better and that we do not afford so many playback errors in the set-up."
Of course, Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game.
"But you don't know whether you can talk about a failed start after a draw.
The performance could be quite okay, "said Hoffmann.
"But if we can score four points on Sunday and concentrate on the Cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a good start to the season."
His coach didn't want to know anything about that.
"I only judge the start of the season after six to eight match days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue just because the Saxony game in Heidenheim had to be canceled prematurely because of a storm.
"Now they can practically start the season with a home game," Funkel said and Hoffmann believes the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher, as they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascendancy favourite in the bones.
"But they don't know as 100 percent where they currently stand," says Fortuna's interior defender.
Admittedly, the guests from the Rhineland go into the encounter on Sunday in the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"That we sweep them away just because we have the claim to get under the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose record in only one defeat against Aue from nine games is quite positive.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start," explains Fortunas head coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And so Funkel definitely doesn't want to experience his players on Sunday.

On the day that the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the politically divisive question of whether to hear a challenge to President Obama's health laws, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will represent the case before the court.
The lawyer who will stand trial and claim that the law is to be overturned is believed to be Paul Clement, once attorney general under the administration of George W. Bush.
The dinner took place in a Washington hotel a few hours after the court deliberated on the case.
"This startling breach of morality and opposition to the code punishes the lawsuits of some judges lie, the court abides by the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the US.
"The judges won and dinered during a performance with lawyers with pending proceedings at the court."
Kagan was attorney general under the Obama administration when the first legal appeals in first instance came to court.

Bray explained that the response of the "outraged" to the eviction of their tent camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent eviction of the square and the protestors.

New results of Swedish asylum age assessment tests published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of those tested are over 18 years of age. However, not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests last year.
They are supposed to make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum procedure, after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years old."
The tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months.
"We don't see a big difference in the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are pretty consistent," he told the magazine The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to be over 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests, saying there were 442 cases that "suggest that the person examined is 18 years or older."
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of these cases, the person had openly said that she would turn 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI recordings of knee joints are made, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.

Judging the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure, we shouldn't pretend we could, "he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in this case that's about 10 percent. '

Fully in the plan
The work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton heavy concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We're very good at the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Road and Transport at the Freiburg government headquarters.
In April, work began at the same time on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach in need of repair.
The end of construction is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule will be adhered to.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a vaulted arch bridge made of concrete, which is covered with red brick and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has come of age in the meantime.
In order to ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now being thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are built of red cobblestone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the village entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30-metre wide and seven-tonne so-called bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning.
This is a fringe attachment, which is also used as an operating route.
A 2.20-metre-wide bridge cap is due to be deployed on the southern part of the bridge on Friday.
The pedestrian path is supposed to follow.
What is special about it is that these are finished parts, a patent from the Schramberg company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
The laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach required particular sensitivity.
Because there is also a fibre optic cable to which many companies are connected.
The local residents were informed about the project by hand in advance of the work.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the pavilion in the direction of Schramberg, the traffic is regulated one-lane by a traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at the village entrance of Lauterbach, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is completely closed.
The total cost of the three bridges is EUR 700 000.
It is financed by the country.

AFD in Gerolstein: Colourful protest at German potato salad
It doesn't happen that often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise hard to reconcile.
The parties represented in Kreistag Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left) belong to a broad alliance that is peacefully flying the flag on that day because the AfD is inviting for the "big campaign kick-off" in the Gerolstein town hall of Rondell.
And well-known names at the start - such as Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the federal election on September 24, and Deputy Federal President Beatrix of Storch.
But those who are on site hours before the start of the event don't want to listen to the AfD people, they want to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colourful."
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at a table" on the fountain square, but now takes place in the parking lot below the roundabout - and thus right in front of those who come to the AfD event in the town hall.
A colourful picture that presents itself there.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of the Forum One World and one of the leading organizers, is really happy about: "Great, how many people have come together here."
There is music and lots of food, including an "ancient German potato salad that the AfD could easily eat," says the woman who brought it with her.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, it shows presence especially at the station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD actually get on Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he had tried to organise such an event and was awarded the contract.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked in Daun, but received a rejection there because there were not enough parking spaces because of the Laurentiuskirmes, which had already been built up.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a beautiful event here."
Looking ahead to the event on the Rondellvorplatz, he says: "That's the good right of the people, main thing, it stays peaceful."
And so it does: Around 8 p.m., a band provides entertainment on the Rondellvorplatz, in which Stadthalle hosts various speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
In the room are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the federal election, Alice Weidel, and Deputy Federal President Beatrix von Storch to give their speeches.
Unchanged is the police presence, but so far officials have had a quiet evening.
Just over an hour takes the AfD event, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there is scheduled to clean up shortly after 9pm.
The police can depart - no special occurrences.

Trombone meets trumpet
There will be a rehearsal with the Wolfacher trombonist Frederic Belli in the series of Haslacher monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest," or even "Balkan folklore" meets a classical German education with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
So is Petkov Solotrompeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a solo posaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the borders on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
For the two, Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new robe, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the play "Exchange Suite" by jazz choreographer Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and free playing are combined into a fascinating work of art.

"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.

After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I've always lived dualism and seriously believed in it.
So it has never confused or hindered me.
I just never liked not being taken seriously. '
She particularly suffered as a result of this, according to "Bang Showbiz," but at school, when she preferred to dress like a boy: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was eleven the kids told me I would look like a boy.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.

In particular, she doesn't like to explain her love life to the public: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.

The governor of West Virginia announces that he is changing party
. The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me, "Governor Justice said.
'Today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of reflection... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can't help you anymore if I am a Democratic governor. '
The rally broke out in cheers.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
'as a coach, I'd say it's time to play another game. '
Mr. Trump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.

Justice, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and inherited a coal business from his father.
He's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening saying, "Governor Justice's party change is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us rather than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governorships and the control of the fewest legislative bodies in history, Governor Justice's announcement is only the latest rejection of a party that is top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.

Coe praises "honest" Russian apology for doping scandal
The world's chief of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday what he described as a blatant apology from Russia to a doping scandal, but he reiterated that it was not the moment for the country to be reintegrated into the sport.
Russia's athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country's exile from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were snapped away gold and silver medals in competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to uphold the ban, which was imposed in November 2015, after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation recognized by itself that it had experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for his reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the task force's recommendations that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia," Coe said.
"We must do everything we can in the coming months to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the depraved system, "he added
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships, which begin in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.

Act of mourning for soldiers crushed in Mali
At a funeral ceremony in Fritzlar, northern Hessian, around 1000 people of the two commemorated soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precautions.
On the pending crash, Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
However, she described the two killed pilots as "experts in their field."
"We bow down to this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Chief of Staff from North Hesse had died in Mali in West Africa on Wednesday a week ago.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and brought to the Fritzlarer Dom Saint Peter on Thursday, accompanied by a vigil of the German army.
At lunchtime only the relatives in the church said goodbye.
After that, the funeral began in the circle of family, close friends, representatives of the German army and politics.
Among them were Hesse's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Inspector General of the German Armed Forces Volker Wieker.
Mourners laid down roses, the relatives stood arm-in-arm at the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Defence Minister von der Leyen described the soldiers killed as "highly decorated" and depleted.
The Chief of Staff had helped to set up the flight operation of the fighter helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also declared: "If this occupation could not avert the crash, then no one would have been able to."
Minister von der Leyen did not show any doubts about the UN mission in Mali: The deployment was dangerous.
But it was also of high importance "for a country from which we are separated only by two states," she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
According to Credit Suisse's Fair Value Model, the Swiss franc continues to be undervalued against the euro, even though it has increased from a Swiss franc-euro exchange rate of over 1.60 to around 1.50 since 2007.
The stock markets of developed countries are rated with a price-to-earnings ratio of 17 compared to a CGV of ten for emerging stock markets.
Value investors focus on the "price" in the price-to-earnings ratio, while growth investors are more interested in the "profit" element of this indicator.
Thus, Contrarian investors choose companies that are undervalued and have negative price momentum.
Finally, the Euro-Swiss franc exchange rate remains an issue:
The stronger and more often, for example, the price of a stock oscillates, the greater the fluctuation width and the more risky the capital investment is.
"The decision of the Swiss National Bank to set the course at 1.20 was crucial for the rapid revival of growth," recalls Melli.
If you look at the price of gold over a longer time series, then you have to say that the yellow metal is not exactly cheap at its current price.
Corporate profits and earnings dynamics are recovering from a low level, and valuations such as the price-to-earnings ratio are also beginning to increase in anticipation of rising profits.
In 2010, Geithner had still attracted the attention of the media and the Chinese authorities when he complained at the WEF about the course of the yuan.
If a rapid appreciation of the Chinese currency is potentially dangerous for the global economy, why is the White House so fixated on the yuan's course?
"Even though the price-to-earnings ratio is currently within the range of the values recorded in 2007, we do not expect a significant correction at the moment.
Macroeconomic aspects and corporate profits will not be among the main driving factors, which is why we also expect the price-to-earnings ratio to expand in 2013.
Shirakawa predicts inflation of just 0.6 percent in 2014, which is well below the BoJ's 2 percent target and could lead to the central bank having to further weaken the yen exchange rate in order to achieve its inflation target.
The highest returns seem to be achieved when dividend yields are high and the price-to-earnings ratio (KGV) is low.
Higher return on equity, a higher price-to-book ratio and a higher pay-out ratio, "said Stefano Natella, Head of Global Equity Research in Credit Suisse's Investment Banking Division.
This results in higher price-to-book ratio.
The PEG ratios (price-to-earnings ratio divided by profit growth) of most large and almost all medium-sized enterprises are still quite favourable in comparison to other emerging economies.
As a result of the strengthening of the Swiss franc, the dollar's exchange rate fell within a few years from around 4.30 Swiss francs to just over 2 Swiss francs.
In addition, valuations of future price-to-earnings ratios appear attractive, as most companies' shares are listed at the lower end of their historical range.
Finally, the costs for the local companies increase less than those for their competitors abroad, while the exchange ratio to the euro remains constant at a rate of around 1.20 Swiss francs.
The basic idea behind convertible bonds is that they will be converted into shares if the company's price falls below a certain value.
When the Swiss franc-euro exchange rate was at 1.60, that set off much larger margins than now, when the rate is at 1.22.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio where money is used for betting on food prices," Bode said.
As a result, only eleven percent consider it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments that are betting on the price of food.
Many bank customers would also draw personal conclusions when they learn that their bank is involved in such transactions: One in two, according to the survey, would cancel all investments where money goes into commodity speculation.
Finally, and this probably says most, our survey of business leaders revealed that a clear majority of Britain wants a course towards changing the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.

About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims took part in the hearing.
Jiménez was of the opinion that micro-credit was a "serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty," and that the governments of the industrialized nations now had to work "more than ever" according to solidarity criteria, and should not allow solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
However, he reluctantly admitted that the strange melancholy under which he was suffering could be attributed to a more natural, somewhat more palpable cause - namely, the serious and protracted illness - indeed, the apparently near dissolution - of a tenderly beloved sister - the only companion of long years - of the last and only relatives on earth.
Prince Henrik does not want a tomb next to his wife
The husband of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was announced by the Royal House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard has already made a sarcophagus for the two of them.
The Queen agreed with her husband's decision, it continued in the communication.
It was still unclear where Prince Henrik would be buried.
But he had no intention of being buried in his native France.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title.
After his wife Margrethe's ascension to the throne in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
He retired in 2016 and also holds the title of "Prince Supper."
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he did not consider himself to be equivalent to his wife - even after death, explained Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman of the Danish royal house.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will ultimately be is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be buried in his native France, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for for the last 50 years.
A native of Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, the son of a French noble family, Margrethe had met in London in 1965.
He worked on the Thames in the French embassy.
While his later wife always flew the expressions of sympathy of the people, Prince Henrik, in his almost 50-year reign with the Danes, had a heavy stand.
In an autobiography, Henrik commented about the first few years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticised.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk socks instead of knitted socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, who I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had a reputation here for being the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for leniency.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed.
There were two mistakes! "

Prime Minister Weil wants swift new election
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a rapid re-election of the country after losing the red-green government majority, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday it was in favour of the dissolution of Parliament.
Earlier, the surprise resignation of a Green MP from her regional parliament in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the state elections, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and the FDP.
Former Greens MP Elke Twesten justified her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she declared in Hanover on Friday.
CDU group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his group that they be included.
This would give the CDU and the FDP a combined 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Parliament, the SPD and the Greens 68.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new Landtag will be elected on 14 January next year.
Thümler said the red-green state government must now decide whether it could continue to govern without a majority in this situation.
Stephan Weil considers it essential, however, that the Landtag decides on its self-dissolution as soon as possible.
The CDU group is expected to decide on its next course of action on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility that the state parliament will remove the trust of the prime minister and elect a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be examined in a legally clean manner, "Thümler said.
"All issues will be discussed calmly if they are considered in a legally reasonable way."
Thümler called Twesten's move "yet somewhat curious."
The politician herself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good. ""
She described herself as a follower of black-green.
The Greens called on the breakaway MPs to return their country mandate.
"We assume, of course, that it will return its state mandate, which it received via the Green Land List, with immediate effect," said the country's presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
Greens leader Anja Piel said: "We very much regret the decision of Elke Twesten."
She had deliberately chosen not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even in view of the fact that there were no substantive differences, we cannot follow this step."
SPD candidate for chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of Lower Saxony Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The conduct of former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of voters, but also a betrayal of red-green," the federal head of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to allow the state parliament to be quickly re-elected.
Twesten's exit costs the majority of the red-green in Lower Saxony.
The politician "in her injured vanity and in her frustration put her personal interests before the good of the country," criticised SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is taking part in this dirty intrigue game and is trying to make political capital out of it."
Lower Saxony's CDU group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his deputies that Elke Twesten be included in the CDU.
The leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of using personal career gifts to distort the outcome of the 2013 state elections.
At that time, the CDU was the strongest force before the SPD, but the SPD and the Greens had a thin majority of one vote in the Land parliament.

Minister for Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from toxic eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves.
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is interviewed by the Editorial Network Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print.
On the consumer protection portal www.lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information on the eggs batches affected.
Eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we currently know, a health hazard is practically impossible.
Is Aldi now taking on the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the Enlightener is not really perceived by the Federal Agriculture Minister?
Food control is the responsibility of the federal states.
Despite this, my house immediately opened up and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries ever since Germany became aware of its concern.
All information and risk assessment is available to consumers.
Like manufacturers, retailers must ensure that the products sold are commercially viable and safe.
If the maximum residue limit of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded for eggs, these are not marketable.
However, uncontaminated eggs can be sold and eaten.
This time, the plants are not to blame.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, the production companies are not directly to blame.
On the contrary, they are likely to suffer economic damage as a result of alleged illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there are too few inspectors in an emergency.
Is there a shortage of staff or a lack of coherent competence?
After all, it was the official controls that uncovered the issue.
The truth, however, is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100% excluded.
It is precisely for this reason that a rigorous investigation of such events and the surrender to public prosecutors in cases where criminal offences may be committed is of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear on a number of occasions that I expect full information from the responsible authorities.
Is regular alarmism in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and marketable food.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The adulterated product has put manufacturers, dealers and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the keeping of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to ensure that the facts are clarified swiftly and in full.
How football's financial rules affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules, which aim to prevent unfettered spending by European football clubs, will not disrupt Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences are yet to come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, because the senior organisation that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will at some point have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was funded without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neyma's move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money loose for Neymar to sign and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by Qatar's energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on acquiring players, but have to counter with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them the break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs, which had incurred enormous debts in their pursuit of success, were effectively cheating and risking ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on the clubs "debt to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used at Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the squad and build a global brand - should become a tougher affair.
During the current three-year FFP investment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can sustain losses of 30 million euros.
And although Platini fell out of favour of the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to campaign to discourage excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future," Andrea Traverso, who is in charge of FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar's buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for the accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the transfer fee for the next five years, amounting to 44.4 million euros, can be reported in the annual financial statements.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit PSG, along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.
PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then $82 million), which was later lowered to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League season be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenue through companies linked to the owners of a club.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG, if the value of sponsorship were to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of PSG's payments to Neymar could come via payments made by the organising committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar in 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and such a manoeuvre could be easy to figure out for UEFA regulators.
The sanctions against PSG so far mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA did not have any preparatory discussions with PSG about Neymar's transfer, the people familiar with the situation said on Thursday.
They spoke on condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015 / 16 with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association expects sales to increase by at least 30 percent after the signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go, and it tried to prevent Neymars moving away by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," the president of La Liga, Javier Tebas, told the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's eventual ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations against a state that funds a club.
"It's the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as a country has an association, anything is possible.
It's going to be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country. '
The Turkish community of Germany reacted calmly: It recalled the victims of racist violence with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate at the weekend.
The urban tender for the 16 gates opens up a new debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
No doubt a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either that is the case, or someone has the idea of putting gates on the land.
Collserola is more complex, "says the architect, for whom the title" Gates of Collserola "entails a" lexical trap ": One must not imagine it "as access to a park, but as a narrowing of areas where action is needed."
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate next to it.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success," "marginalized" people, "who are always standing in front of closed doors to lend" hope "and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city of solidarity."
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
Swiss is looking for a new automotive supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has made board chocolate for Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is about to come to an end: The airline is rewriting the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" on Friday at the request of the news agency sda.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the spokeswoman.
The flight attendants distribute around 17 million small red-packed chocolate tablets to 14 grams per year to passengers before landing.
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.
According to "Northwest Switzerland," industry insiders estimate the order volume to be between 1.5 and 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary generates annual sales of around one billion Swiss francs.
But the advertising effect is always more important: For a chocolate manufacturer it is a prestigious order.
Swiss does not want to reveal how many candidates there are for the new call.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey plans to seek a renewal of the contract beyond spring 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer could not be reached for comment.
Swiss has been distributing chocolate boards on board its flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut, in collaboration with Hug, had supplied the chocolate tablets.
Swiss introduced the possibility of placing the logo two and a half years ago with the launch of its collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers will be spoiled with treats from the Confiserie Sprüngli, in Business Class wet passengers Schoggi from Lindt and in Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi by Chocolat Frey is also distributed on the short circuit, both in business and in economy class.
Energy policy cannot, however, be assessed from an environmental point of view alone, because soon not a single power station - of whatever kind - would be built and stone, clay and earth processing and all chemical factories would have to be examined for the acceptance of their waste by the public, if not very long.
Besides clay and glass, metals, cardboard and plastics are now used as raw materials for their production.
This should be done in good order.
And the best sound is underneath the House of Commons.
I have not yet heard any Conservative say that we should store waste in the best possible clay under the Thames.
The area is urbanized (10% of the area is cultivated); light to heavy soil (sand, clay, clay) is for the most part suitable for soil management (41% is arable land), forest is hardly found (8.2%).

According to PRINZ / 15 /, binding soil species always consist of a mixture of clay and hatching fractions with very different proportions of coarse grain fractions.
Under the same climatic conditions, the content of organic substances in the clay is higher than in the sip or clay.
In particular, clay, but also clay, are incorporated as natural materials in layers with predominantly static compression at the landfill base.
The sealing of landfills with such clay sand mixtures is extremely economical and easy to control.
The secondary petroleum (clay) sealing layer of variant 2 consists exclusively of petroleum materials.
It is recommended to produce this base layer from recycled materials (usually clay) rather than from insitu compressed soil.
The EPO offers a number of methods for calculating the thickness of the petroleum (clay) layer.
The newly drafted draft directive points out that the existing legal requirements (60 cm of compressed clay with a k _ value of 1 to 109 m / s) are no longer sufficient for this system variant.
In accordance with the respective geological conditions, the compression of the subsoil is achieved either by filling or pressing sealing masses (clay cement and bentonite cement blends).
The gradient i of the wall area is calculated from the water mirror difference and the thickness of the sealing wall, while the gradient i for the sealing horizon (clay, silt) is determined from the water level difference and the penetration depth of the drying wall.
The sound acts as a semi-permeable membrane.
However, the animon exchange capacity is increased by the organic substance kerogen, which can be refined in tone up to 2%.

Here are items made of iron and calcareous clay (bricks) with matter, ground-colored fracture (generally brown, red or yellow).
The R & D programme for the in situ qualification of the concept of final storage in deep clay formations has been continued.
The materials have to be tested in these laboratories as well as on site in clay, granite and salt formations.

The sound is first fitted with a glass layer and then interfered in the fire at temperatures of up to 1160 ° C in order to achieve the desired mechanical force and hardness.
The German company Eisenhütte Westfalia-Lünen has been building small mole, fox and badger propulsion machines since 1965, which are mainly used in soft rock (clay, plaster, pyrit).
100 grams of soil (fertile, non-sterile earth) are suspended in 1 000 ml of chlorine-free drinking water (soil types with a very high content of clay, sand and organic carbon are unsuitable).
The results of the studies carried out under the PAGIS project have been published in a five-volume edition: A short version (EUR 11775EN), clay (EUR 11776EN), granite (EUR 11777FR), salt (EUR 11778EN) and the undersea sediments (EUR 11797).
The clay, this malleable material that our ancestors used for various purposes and which is now used in fields as diverse as construction or the pharmaceutical industry, has drawn the attention of scientists and technicians through its physical and chemical properties to develop a safe and reliable system for the deep disposal of nuclear waste.

Nostalgia goes to the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This retelling of the story is at the same time nostalgic for the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s grunge era (when the pre-thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves, that is called Paul Banks.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By sticking to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who grow up - they nevertheless managed to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later," with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally ingrained and its parody goes more according to the casting-scattering principle, including a riff on the Stalker films of the 90's like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" (").
At one point, a character roams through an Apple powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The amiable coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there's another crazy-vicious plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is included, now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-done impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It's especially a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's lower-lip beard of "Singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" Series until he reaches what I assume to be his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the gang as they attend the film premiere of "Summer Hot."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, evokes a different kind of nostalgia: The revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde," and even "GLOW" with its East-versus-West wrestling iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director claims to be a grounded TV series: A Romanian drama of the eighties starring the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The lead roles - a hard-boiled Gregory and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of 'Find the voice out'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the veracity of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is included - that it often plays like a single one.
With six long episodes, it drags away, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective," which has been edited to a lesser length, could better deliver its agitprop satire, as Gregor and Iosef keep visiting the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men swallowing up a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a fodder for a pledge.
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: We are even doing it with our own recent history and with theirs.

Blow to drug mafia in the country
The police have succeeded in striking a blow against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Baar district, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, the prosecutor's office in Konstanz announced on Friday.
15 suspects between the ages of 25 and 77 were arrested and arrest warrants have already been issued against them.
In addition, officials secured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms, as well as several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested during simultaneous raids in Italy.
German arrest warrants were issued against the two suspect Italians.
The two will therefore probably be shipped to Germany.
The action involved Italian and Bavarian investigators.
In total, more than 300 police officers were deployed.
Members of the Mafia are accused of organised drug-related crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder, robbery and extortion.
The Konstanz Public Prosecutor's Office has been investigating the organised drug trade in the southern German region since summer 2016.
There was a lively exchange between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo, and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
As a result, the large-scale operation was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning.
The investigation focused in particular on Italian nationals with close links to the Italian Mafia.

"Data of citizens who should not show up there ": According to a report, the register of foreigners in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to sometimes serious wrong decisions in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government Commissioner for Refugee Management, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has drawn attention to large gaps in the central register of foreigners.
Deficiencies in the data recorded there could lead to "sometimes serious wrong decisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, Weise warned in an analysis available to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung."
According to the figures, the register covers 10 million people of foreign nationality, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data will be managed by about 600 immigration authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts had not been good.
In individual cases, data from 1921 had been found, "by people who have long since ceased to be alive, or by citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register."
"Erroneous data input can significantly slow return processes," the report continues.
The statistics on people who are forced to leave the EU also include EU citizens who do not even have to leave the country.
Such false assignments, however, "led to a distorted debate about how to deal with expatriates," according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the federal government appears to have begun sending refugee families with children under the age of 16 back to Italy once they have entered from there.
This emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung."
The paper therefore states that the BAMF has been carrying out such procedures "concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and toddlers - again to Italy since 1 June 2017."
This has been virtually impossible since the end of 2014, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin agreement, refugees are the responsibility of the EU state they reach first.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that state can send him back to the country of entry.
The Office now writes as justification: "In the meantime, the capacity of families with children under age in Italy has increased considerably."
Italy had given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments sufficient.
Other EU states would also send refugees back there under the Dublin agreement.
Ulla Jelpke, the left-wing group's internal affairs spokesperson in the Bundestag, criticised this decision: "Families with children are threatened with illegal reception conditions and a threat to the best interests of children because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system."
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach has already been provided by the blood donation service for other people.
At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
In particular, Jürgen Greule, who has now made 100 donations, has now shared 50 litres of blood.
Traditionally, in the meeting of the local council, the community acknowledges the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It is ingenious how our body is designed for this and we pay respect to the donors who make their blood available to strangers, and also unselfish," stressed Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single donation of blood helps several people," explained Holger Maisenbacher, head of the German Red Cross (DRC).
For example, three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions that will be carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
"This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRC's county preparedness chief.
Obviously the change to the theatre a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants.
Even before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.

This group includes circuses, yearmarket stalls, dance halls and dance schools, betting and lottery, Lotto-TOTTO, casinos, amusement parks, slot machines, as well as theatre agencies, ticket sales points and auxiliary services.

The tag could contain information about the product, for example the address of a website where you can buy tickets for a movie or a play.
The campaign covers all consumer issues: Fake tickets, transfer of tickets in case of illness, air travel, roaming charges, health insurance in the EU and problems shopping abroad.
Almost all circuses took over this form of ticket sales, and today most circuses practice a combination of subscription events and shows for which tickets can be purchased over the counter at checkouts or over the internet.
The cards are dealt in such a way that there is a separation of the supporters of the playing teams by means of partition.
The so-called "quota" of tickets, i.e. their distribution to the participating countries, takes into account the interest of fans in these countries in cards.
It must not happen that fans can buy tickets for a block in the stadium that is not intended for them.
The cards must contain information about the holder and the origin of the card so that their path can be traced.
The observance of stadium bans is achieved through the establishment of the system of reservation and distribution of tickets as well as measures to prevent the transfer of the issued cards in any form whatsoever.
- in principle, the purchaser of the card is also the end user;
- the card includes the so-called side dish, in which the organizer indicates in any case
When allocating the available cards to the target groups, care must be taken to ensure that the general public and fans of the participating teams have sufficient cards, in all fairness and to the extent permitted by the European Community competition rules.
If the reservation of a card is not made exclusively through the national football federation or the own club of the spectator / fans, the interested party must specify the team of which he is a fan.
A buyer receives no more than two cards.
The final handover of the cards takes place as late as possible (interchangeable vouchers).
The organiser must provide the assurance that the person on whose name the card has been issued - the cardholder - will also receive his ticket.

The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the slowdown in inflation dampened speculation of a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it kept interest rates on family incomes in the midst of increasing pressure.
Policymakers on the Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members aiming for a rise this month, as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the autumn.
But she signalled that interest rate hikes would become necessary over the next few years to rein in inflation fuelled by Brexit and she said borrowing costs may have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will demand time for the funding plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide £15 billion more under this scheme - with £115 billion.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term as pressure on households' real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."
On interest rates, she reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool down inflation and a "slightly larger" scale than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that increases would be "gradual" and "limited."
The Bank's downward adjusted growth forecasts for this year and next are up against the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after this news.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and fell 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision to no change comes after recent disappointing growth figures dampened rising expectations of an interest rate rise and GDP rose to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly towards the end of the year, according to the bank.
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and small salary increases, as the tightening first gets worse before it then improves.
She added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" the income slump over the next few years, but she added that wages will recover "significantly" at the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also boosted by rising demand for UK goods, due to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after interest rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the fall in the pound.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy.
Before the Bank's last judgment on interest rates, the call for an interest rate hike had soared as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for a rise to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the bank said this was expected and it will pick up again in the coming months.
The bank said the excess relative to its target of 2% was "entirely" due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as lenders look loudly for deals and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those where existing deals are phasing out and new mortgages are closing, and many with fee-free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular. "
NHS (The National Health Service) is to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight in the High Court against funding for the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that a pre-intercourse pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 per cent, is now being delivered by the health service via an initial three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a Supreme Court ruling last year that the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite claims that local authorities should fund it.
The move, announced on Thursday, was hailed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as an "important new intervention," while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a "pivotal moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to sign up, and further clinics will follow in October before it is due to be introduced across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infected individuals.
Taking prep before intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or so as early as two hours before intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and those with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also sign up for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The programme will be worth £10m and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive sourcing.
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted, absorbed and implemented on a large scale.
Mr Stevens said: "This major new intervention should complement and overhaul the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It's another milestone in the more than three decades of sustained progress in addressing one of humanity's biggest health challenges. '
Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
Prep, if it is targeted at needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access to this NHS-funded trial in England to develop a new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be for the study to be carried out quickly across the country and for no one who has a risk for HIV to be left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been procured, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people. "
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it's important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV-infected and that it will help us move one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society. '
Living the big life: Mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a lavish home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, narrowed down from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It's on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's testament to the new design that Joanne hasn't packed and sold her bags.
"Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day. '
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine floor to make the most of the lavish ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my request, "she says.
To that end, she commissioned Erfan Azadi's architectural and design studio Duck & Shed from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine floor where you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the default.
"The steelwork is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without us having to bend down.
It wasn't just about building a simple platform, but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below. "
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height on top of each other - with a lot of additional drama.
For the mezzanine floor, a classic copper-lit window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends in order to make it work longer.
In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.
Through the perception of a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can shut out the kitchen if not used.
Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering art went in there," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, furious MDF door.
'it's counterweight, so when you push the door up, it glides very easily. '
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the floor space - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and make a calculation based on the size of the floor."
Here they have managed to increase the floor area and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and that therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart. '
It shows that an apartment can be transformed into something quite amazing by good design and increased square meters of something standard.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave these.
An architectural history with ups, downs and happy ending: The Austrian World Fair Pavilion of Brussels in 1958 won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and sold.
A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that she was the favored person who received all the confessions and had received all the prizes in advance (Gastronomy Competition Oster, audience vote on the best hand-made costume and Reina Madre), had therefore not made the other female candidates jealous on the stage. "
Ariel Osorio, journalist for the program "Como en casa" at the channel RCN, said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition does not become Queen after all."
You can judge for yourself when I say a penalty and a red card were due.

Brothers fight because of a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, are in a dispute over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth over $500 million.
The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who took him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be divided.
Paul has wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
That money has been invested in real estate, and De LUTIS's portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping centres.
According to an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De LUTIS family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third.
A court filing states that this means Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought were the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, the first Supreme Court hearing took place after several failed mediations.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - which Colin, as Paul claims, ruled him out.
Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of managing some possessions incompetently.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Costs are rising in the case, with hundreds of pages containing affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms from both sides.
Ms De LUTIS and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessens from the late 1950's and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early Seventies.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property, in which Colin opened the family's first jean shop.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school, when Paul was still a little kid (about 10 years old)."
Anna De LUTIS says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property amicably to their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De LUTIS group of companies, with Colin alleging that Mark was paid $10 million when leaving the company and $26 million when he left.
Both Luke and Mark are, Paul says, "embittered about the terms of their financial separation."
Colin has been very restrained, even though he was a former AFL board member and, according to a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the TV star's best friend.
Fairfax Media made contact with Colin and Paul De LUTIS and their attorneys.
Only Colin replied by text message to say "I really can't say much" because the case was before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and drag our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he was "still hoping for a solution."
On Friday, that hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.

Legal basis: Article 103 of the EEC Treaty, Basic Regulation 974 / 71 OBJECTIVE: Avoiding short-term distortions of trade flows resulting from the difference between the market rate and the agricultural conversion rate or the "green" rate expressed in ecus in some Member States.
- for those Member States whose currency is higher than the ECU equivalent calculated on the basis of the common agricultural policy conversion rate (green rate), monetary compensatory amounts are levied on imports and granted on exports (positive WAB);
For this purpose, the WAB will no longer be calculated according to the difference between the green rate and the central rate, but according to the difference between the green rate and the "central rate multiplied by a correction factor."
A budget of DM 225 million or ECU 120 M1o (course 1: 1) per year would have to be earmarked for 100 000 people, each receiving DM 4 500, of which 50% would come from the ESF.
On 8.10.1990, the pound sterling joined the exchange rate mechanism; its ECU central rate is 0.696904, which is slightly different from the previous fictitious rate.

(2) In the case of Guiana, the agricultural conversion rate applicable to the compensatory amounts is the rate applicable on the first day of the month on which the products are shipped.
If the amounts to be paid in the individual currencies are fixed in relation to another currency, the conversion to the price stated in the order is made.
For the other currencies, there was no gap between the green rate and the market rate (including correction factor).
The conversion takes place after the course, which applies 30 days before the last date for the offer submission.
The financial plans of the Community support frameworks are expressed in ecus, and the course laid down in this decision will apply.
(3) The financial contribution of the Commission shall be paid in ecu at the rate applicable on the first working day of the month in which the application for reimbursement published in the Official Journal of the European Communities was made.
Tax law, on the other hand, introduced procedures relating to the deductibility of exchange rate differences arising from the conversion of foreign currency assets if the current exchange rate differs from the rate at which they were booked or included in previous annual accounts (Article 72 of the Income (Tax) 917 (1986).
Income and expenses are converted to the rate that was valid on the day of the business incident; in practice, an average rate is usually applied.
If the business is to be charged at a contractually agreed rate, this course is to be used.
This means in particular that monetary foreign currency items will be converted to the closing price unless a "hedging" rate is used in accordance with paragraph 48.
Consequently, the results for the financial year are always shown at the current rate at the balance sheet date.
In most cases, claims and / or liabilities expressed in foreign currency were converted to the rate that prevailed on the day they were booked, with unrealised gains not taken into account at the balance sheet date, but the corresponding conversion losses were very well accounted for.

Since then, the ECU at the rate of 1: 1 has been replaced by the euro.

Three aspects of producer prices are particularly important: Their evolution over time at Community level (an index is used to combine real prices for individual categories), the evolution of prices in the Member States and the resulting differences (absolute prices in nominal ecu at market rate) and the institutional ratio between producer prices.

Trump's new chief of staff is planning to limit the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff is planning to restrict the flow of information on President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the chief on a more even course.
Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with senior staff on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he wanted to fix: Bad information getting into the hands of the president.
Kelly told employees "that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he were to receive good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he is in the White House, his television advertising is still going strong.
"If candidate Trump was upset about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of posts that were to be persuaded," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption involves steady praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we others don't know - that Trump's tweets would have contained even more ignition without their interventions.
We will probably never learn anything about the tweets that Trump did not send.
If his co-workers have managed to keep him away from trouble several times, then their efforts have paid off.
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from provoking controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House made up of rival parties keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may be promoting their views of the world.
Politico - entirely concerned with this story - reported in May on the advisers "preference to provide dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.
This was an example that was described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
'current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cutouts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he's stiffening to figure out where these come from.
That is exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a bunch of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has made false allegations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began interviewing employees "about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the White House secretary general, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives."
How did it work?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still striving for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
In short, they fear that all the sacrifices that have been made for price stability will have been in vain.

Yes, to some extent that is the price of progress.
In the current boom, contagion has occurred within markets and across markets, as rising prices fuel enthusiasm - and thus further price increases - first within a city and then in other cities, even at the other end of the world.
Historically, home prices have evolved enormously, and prices in these cities are still rising at a rapid rate, although this increase is already somewhat slower than a year or more ago.
Based on extrapolations of growth trends, it seems certain that prices in most of these cities will rise significantly over another year or longer, even if the rate of increase continues to decline.
Prices in glamour cities are likely to fall sharply in the next serious recession, or in the event of a shock to the local economy, as well as in the case of soaring interest rates.
In this case, contagion within and across markets could set in motion a downward spiral and reduce prices for years.
Travellers negotiate a ditch and return to the 'million'
Some of the West Midlands' most affluent homeowners are standing again with some determined travelers on war footing who negotiated a ditch drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a wealthy Strait of Solihull called the "millionaire row."
They brought horses, babies and an army of vans after they were only thrown out in May, but without being deterred by a ditch excavated by the council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defense facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unobstructed to find a way.
Angry residents have pressed Solihull council, who said it was "useless to deal with the problem."
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday night after being sent on by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame, as it has been useless in dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, were moved on and are now back again.
More arrived last night, probably more today. "
She added: "Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by holding long teachings to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue to pay my community tax if the council can't even stop that. '
One local resident, who did not want to be named, said: "It is ridiculous, we have just seen the last round of these travellers, only to be sacked by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area. "
A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the countryside beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihulls Police. We are taking the necessary legal steps to allow them to move on as quickly as possible.
In order to support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to provide a picture of the situation in which the court must consider when we present our case. "

From Birkenhof, Waldhotel Luise
From the former Hotel Birkenhof will be the Waldhotel Luise.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and is due to reopen on 1 March next year.
This is good news for the city.
The closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the former Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 resulted in the loss of around 30,000 overnight stays per year, as well as income from the tourist tax.
In autumn 2014, in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building was offered to the district council as collection accommodation, causing controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not uncontroversial in the local council at the time.
But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already at that time spoke of serious interested parties in the house.
He should be proved right.
The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has bought the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a three-star plus-category house again under the name of Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof construction debris containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is being carried out.
The floors were ripped out, some ceilings removed, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still much to be done by March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer, talking to our newspaper.
Everything is to be redone in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should later become "beautifully close to the citizen," as Thomas Scherer expresses himself.
"We want to make a piece of jewellery out of it."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are among the amenities.
One does not want to position oneself on the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on a high level of the city centre, Scherer emphasizes.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its approximately 60 rooms, wants to position itself broadly, Scherer explains.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, Scherer said.
The ideas of the city are identical with those of the hotel group.
'we're on the same line. '
Asked about the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to be precise.
Just under a million euros, he reckons.
The exterior systems are also brought to the front, this is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard, a large terrace is created, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."
It is not an easy task, but it needs to be done now and there is no way around it.
The "much more important task" is to come on Sunday.
Not a single accident is the same and calculating the cost of the parts and working hours can be a long and complicated task.
For the basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are usually supported.
The joke of the matter is that the company appears to the operator as a classic company customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.

"A counter with trained staff is available at these locations, which advises interested parties when buying the internet and also plays the coupon on the card," says the spokesman of the project Martin Opatrný.
A passenger who does not use suburban buses and no longer knows when the coupon will end can go back to the self-service machines, where the coupons are played on the card.
The new elections are over, and now it's all about the coalition; in the debates on public television, the party leaders barely looked in their cards.
Russia affair: Us special investigator sets up Grand Jury
In the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have set up a so-called Grand Jury, according to a report.
The panel had begun work in the past few weeks, wrote the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper interpreted the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations.
The CNN channel reported there were already initial subpoenas from the body in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
Us intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of purposefully interfering in the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there was collusion between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation will focus on several men who acted as advisers to the Republican during the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also took more and more of Trump's private and business environment under the microscope.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator had personally put Trump at the center and was investigating the accusation of whether the president may have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Juries is to examine available evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether charges should be brought.
Grand juries are therefore also called Prisoners.
In most cases, they are switched on when there are larger and more controversial cases.
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.
The Board can also be activated by the Public Prosecutor's Office to summon people for questioning under oath.
According to the CNN channel, subpoenas have already been issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People involved in the meeting had been asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as his then-campaign chief, Paul Manafort, were also present at the conversation.
Legal experts said on US television on Thursday night that the inauguration showed that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that he wanted to act quickly if necessary.
However, it did not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury would be turned on at the end to decide on the prosecution of an indictment.
Still, the establishment of the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
Amid the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign by his political opponents.
"The Russia story is a total fabrication," Trump said.
The issue gives Democrats a way to "feel good because they have nothing else to talk about."
His special counsel, Ty Cobb, said in a statement that he did not know anything about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
But they also usually work in secret, he pointed out.
The White House supports any action that accelerated the Special Envoy's work in a "fair" way.
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that he is not under investigation against the president.
There was no reason to believe that this had changed, the statement continued.
Mueller, however, had only been deployed after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this accusation, accusations against Trump had been made that he wanted to obstruct justice.
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop investigating then-national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.
According to US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and his associates.
That sparked speculation about whether Trump wanted to sack Mueller.
Unlike an independent special counsel to Congress, such as in the Watergate affair surrounding the later ousted President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Justice Department at the president's insistence.
However, several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented bills on Thursday under which the special counsel could no longer be dismissed so easily.
Antarctica: Gigantic iceberg drifts in the Antarctic
In West Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg of barely seven times the size of Berlin has dissolved from the Schelfeis.
This was announced by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhavener on Wednesday.
The colossus, weighing more than one trillion tons and measuring 5800 square kilometres, is now drifting north and will probably take two or three years before it has melted.
With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.
He does not pose a danger to people.
The extent to which climate change played a role in breaking down the iceberg is unclear, according to researchers.
All in all, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region for around 30 years, writes the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now broken colossus was a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis until now.
Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic peninsula.
North of this skeleton, the balance of waxing and breaking off was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete slap had disintegrated there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is much to be said for the fact that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is also in danger, because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is at present.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can disintegrate if a piece breaks down at a key point.
The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not raise sea levels as they swim on the water and displace ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself.
However, the loss of the ice causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and flow off much faster than before.
This could possibly increase sea levels, but only to a limited extent, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).
According to AWI data, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest slap in Antarctica, covering almost 50,000 square kilometres.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks down regularly.
"Although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now coming into a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary of Britain's Swansea University.
"This is the furthest retreat since records began," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it is disputed whether the Larsen-C skeleton will now grow again or decline in the long term and possibly fall together, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, a great many ice shelves of the Antarctic Peninsula have disintegrated in recent decades.
This long tip of Antarctica stretches towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Antarctic Peninsula's ice surface has fallen by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The increase in temperature had contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by around three degrees over the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where the temperature is rising fastest.
The Adaptation Fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member council, presumably at the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as can be read in the "Piac és Profit."

CDU wants house tariff on staff
Because it is becoming more and more difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU is demanding to step out of the employers "association in order to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the Kreistag waved through 41 new posts in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now another 17 trainees have completed their first working day.
The apprenticeships at the circle are obviously very much sought after.
Around 620 applications were registered for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks personnel in order to be able to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
At present, there are still 50 vacancies in the Mettmann district.
Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as members of the general administration.
In Kreistag, the CDU, together with the FDP and the UWG, would now like to take the initiative and address the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
According to the wishes of the parties, the administration should "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development."
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers, but to address the shortage of applicants in a future-oriented way, it says.
The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, identify concrete measures for new entrants and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know before.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
There is talk of real "competition between public employers."
In addition, there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.
It is high time for action, therefore, so that more jobs do not remain unfilled.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, is going beyond the joint motion with his party.
He recently caused a foul surprise in the district day, when he publicly questioned the coverage of personnel costs and stunned the other parties.
Peoples would like to see all possible avenues for leaving the municipal employers "association reviewed.
"If we do not find a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration should aim for a house tariff with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the surrounding cities," says Völker.
In this way, the CDU is trying to pay the employees and officials better than the tariff regulations for the public service actually provide.
Salaries are currently strictly compulsory, there are increases or more money only if you move to a higher level, which is based on years of work.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new prostitution protection law.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Councillor Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem: They have too few staff.

Italy tightens tone on NGO migrant lifeboats
Italy has warned NGOs using rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they must not continue to do so unless they abide by new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnick's warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat belonging to the German aid organisation 'Youth Rettet' because its crew had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, declined to comment on detailed allegations made by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio CARTOSIO.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organization said in a statement on social media.
'we can only assess all the allegations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation. '
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat from 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is thought that its crew is taking hose-boat migrants on board, delivered to them directly by traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting reportedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the content of which was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of exceeding the authority of the Italian coastguard, which monitors rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives.
Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must, above all, have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be seen as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not entail "significant changes or obstructions" to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).
Minniti meanwhile said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue measures had fallen sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and work with local mayors had borne fruit.
"In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
A modest home market compared to global sales.
The Central and Eastern European countries have gained in importance for Switzerland since their accession to the EU, both as production sites as well as sales and procurement markets.
When the price of oil reached $150 per barrel, sales in the US were already shifting in favour of more economical models.
At BMW, the growth rates in sales in the first six months of the year were even 100 percent.
We also have this experience when investing in the sale of road cars.
And he adds that providing information about a company's philanthropic activities is just as important as communicating sales or competition information at board meetings.
Sales at TrueView-Ads, i.e. promotional clips that are either played before the start of a video or displayed as a display advertisement next to it, also rose by 45 percent last year.
The skilled industrial engineer (Berchten) and the robotic specialist (Guernier) are convinced that their product will be sold, and anticipate an annual sales of 80,000 to 100,000 airbags in the future.
Sales of computers, printers, servers and additional storage capacity will fall short of software and services for the time being, but will catch up over time and perhaps even increase revenues in the highly competitive PC market.
After a decline of 10 percent compared to the previous year in the first quarter of 2013, PC sales to companies in the second quarter were roughly at the same level in the second quarter, which leads to a stabilisation of sales figures.
Rises and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy Trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
It followed vantage points, partly on towers, from which one could look far beyond the Palatinate forest and the upstream plains.
In between there were always longer climbs, for which long trials were rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, the lookout point was at the lookout point, connected by "flowery" trials and moderate rises.
On the last two days there were again many altitude meters.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refuges brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed healing soles in the open-air inhaler.
Neustadt was also approached.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4,500 metres of altitude, the group had got to know the Palatinate Forest at its best - both sporting and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga gears up for e-sports
Will the sports stars be sitting in front of computer consoles in the future instead of sweating through the stadium races in the event of wind and weather?
Fact: E-sports has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - including big stars, millions of fans and huge high-stakes tournaments.
This has also been recognised by the first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly involved in this area.
The start was made in 2015 by the VfL Wolfsburg, later followed by FC Schalke 04 and most recently VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope that this will inspire completely new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure that "a lot of clubs are going up on this train."
Next weekend, the FIFA Football World Cup organises the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London, where gamers from different clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The ex-coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, that the young people will still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-athletes under contract, you could be present on these markets much more often online than just sending the national league team to Asia once a year.
What is it all about?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or just the football simulation FIFA are fought at the competition level.
For a long time, as in normal sport, leagues have been established in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, e-sports is already part of the official program.
But is it a real sport at all?
For many, the idea certainly needs getting used to.
Ingo Froböse has also dealt with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports Academy in Cologne, e-sports is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
There is also a need for cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding and rapid reaction capability.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console, but also their body and pay attention to nutrition.
"The fit player is a good player."
But Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more an issue."
Controls were difficult to carry out in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sport were lacking.
On the positive side, the scientist emphasises the high integrative effect of e-sports.
The players are travelling internationally, this is like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by business consultants Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million Euros were implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to reach 130 million.
Against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga this is not very much.
However, the e-sport is "not far away from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte consultants write.
Internationally, many countries are already further ahead.
Major markets include Asia and the US, where ex-basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez are taking part in US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting company Unikrn.
Things are also happening in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports have been introduced as a teaching subject, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, according to Dutt, first-tier football clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
"In European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB CEO Röttgermann.
Just falling into nostalgia, and clearing up the old days, is no longer enough today.
The aim was to preserve the tradition of the association, but at the same time to align the company with the modern market.
"We live in a digitised world," Dutt also says.
"You can't hold on to the fact that only in football everything stays as it always was."
Unfortunately, the European system of public art financing is falling victim to slow economic growth and growing budget deficits.
A prompt deployment of an adequate civilian and security presence during the months immediately after the NATO bombing campaign in 1999 might have created appropriate safeguards against the backlash that turned victims into perpetrators.
One of these projects will provide medical information to developing countries via the Internet, another will provide communication equipment and experts in disaster and humanitarian emergencies, and a third will aim to provide vaccination coverage for significantly more children worldwide.
However, access to resources is only one part of the problem, and I would like to emphasise once again how important it is that the manufacture, distribution and use of these indiscriminate weapons be denounced.
The Forum, which successfully concluded its fourth meeting in February 2000, deals specifically with forest issues from the perspective of sustainable forest management, addressing not only the underlying causes of deforestation, but also the trade in forest products and the use of market-based forest management tools.

Poison eggs ade - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking
Almost all the federal states are now affected by the scandal of poisoned eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted by removing all eggs from sale throughout Germany.

In this performance-wise, well-balanced encounter, Marcus Blasutto's TSV team consistently showed a great deal of physical effort and a pleasing commitment on the part of both teams.
The Council is currently examining the extent to which these mechanisms are included in Article 7.
We therefore ask the rapporteur, the Commission and the Council to add the agricultural part to the fisheries policy part, for example, by making the title 'agricultural policy aspects of enlargement' 'the agricultural and fisheries aspects of enlargement'.
I would particularly like to address the Council, which, unfortunately, is largely absent, but which has some expectations and concerns.
The compound feedingstuffs industry has once again tried to influence the Council and to overturn the open declaration.
I would like to draw Members' attention to the fact that the Council's working group decided unanimously to recommend to the Council that a joint committee be set up in the action programme to increase the influence of the individual Member States through a combination of management and consultation procedures.
In our opinion, there is a discrepancy in the report on the question, but my group also disagrees as to whether an internal auditor should be established only for the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament, or even for the smaller institutions.
Let me give you two examples: The Education Council, in connection with the issue of student and teacher mobility, because we have seen great inequality in mobility, and the Internal Market, Consumption and Tourism Council, in conjunction with the agenda item on the development of electronic commerce, in order to make inequality accessible to all women and men.
I must therefore acknowledge that this amendment, as the Council and the Commission have said, is not justified in this case, and I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that the import control procedures in the European Union are not working, that fraud is being committed and that these fraud cases are not only bad for the Community taxpayer, but also bad for the functioning of the internal market.
The Commission and the Council will do their part, and that is the most important thing on the agenda in Yugoslavia at the moment; that has always been our interest.
As far as the IGC is concerned, the work before Biarritz at ministerial level has, I believe, already progressed as far as possible, and the informal Council therefore took place at the right time to confirm certain progress in order to give guidance for the final phase in which we now find ourselves.
Madam President, first of all, I would like to congratulate the European Council for adopting the draft Charter as binding.
Meeting the demands of the large countries for more power in the Council and Parliament would upset the balance within the European Union and result in the small countries paying all the price for enlargement.
We must support the efforts of Mr Prodi and Mr Patten to strengthen the Commission's ability to act through parliamentary scrutiny and the necessary parliamentary scrutiny, which does not relate to the Council and Mr Solana.
Although we share the criticism of the Council on many points, it remains to be seen that it would be a confrontation that is not politically feasible and would undermine credibility in European institutions.
I do not want the impression to be created that the Council is not answering the questions put to it.
The Council is actively examining the Commission's proposal and the aforementioned amendments in order to reach an opinion on this issue as soon as possible.
At that time, we did not yet know that the Council and the Commission had pledged aid from these funds for the reconstruction of Serbia and Kosovo.
Mr President, the Council has really surpassed itself with the draft budget it presented for 2001.
In this respect, and also in view of the Commission's acknowledgement that Member States' claims for structural fund payments for 2001 exceed the estimates of the PDB by 8 billion, I think it is time for the Council to think very seriously now that we should do something about the payments and not increase the RAL.
In due course it will also be necessary to give this kind of support and signal to the Council.
Several proposals are already before the Council and Parliament, such as the package of proposals for recasting and updating the hygiene rules.
I would therefore ask you to convey to the Council, which is not present here, and to the Commission the importance of increasing this amount, since, unfortunately, between 20 and 50 new ones are laid for each spacious mine.
The abandonment of the requirement for closer cooperation under the Treaty and the abolition of the right of veto and the possibility of presenting the issue to the European Council would be a violation of fundamental principles of European cooperation within the EU.
The General Affairs Council already approved the first five Action Plans for Somalia, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Morocco and Iraq last October.
The committee responsible has followed me in this, and the signals from the Council have also been pleasantly positive.
The Council will have to ask itself whether, by granting candidate status to Turkey, it has not done more harm than good to this cause.
At its meeting in Feira in June 2000, the Council adopted a common EU strategy for the Mediterranean region and, having proposed and implemented the reform of the MEDA regulation, the European Commission recently presented a document on reinforcing the Barcelona Process.
The Commission and the Council express their willingness to do so.
What diplomatic initiatives does the Council intend to take in order to bring Armenia and Azerbaijan closer together, to resolve their bilateral differences and to promote their cooperation?
Secondly, in its response, the Council refers to NATO as Pontius Pilate, without commenting on Turkey's provocative violation of Greece's sovereign rights, which was expressed this time on the occasion of the NATO maneuver.
However, other countries desperately want the compensation fund, and I must tell you quite frankly that if we were now to propose the compulsory introduction of the compensation fund, the result would be that we could forget about it, because there would never be a majority in the Council for it.
I would like to give an example: As you know, there have been difficulties for the Council in banning the export of products deemed unsafe to third countries, while this ban is very important for the European Parliament and we fully support it.
The Garot report aims to improve the Commission's proposal in some aspects by trying to find a compromise solution with the Council, particularly on financial participation in the fund.
The Council of the European Union also plays an active role, in cooperation with your institution and the European Commission, in updating and constantly strengthening European rules on the prevention and control of this disease.
The Commission and the Council of the European Union bear a heavy responsibility for the scale of the mad cow crisis.
Parliament can be proud that the proposal to establish this College was born here, and we are grateful to the Portuguese Presidency for taking it on board, and we thank the Commission and the Council for their support.
A declaration is also being prepared for the European Council on the economic, social and cultural particularities of sport and its social function in Europe.
His voice would be stronger, and the voice of the ministers who defend agriculture in the service of sustainable development would also be much stronger in the Council if it could be based on decisions taken here in the codecision procedure.
As requested by Mr Brok in his report, the Council will have summary documents setting out the relations between the Union and each of the partner countries in order to make better use of the Union's overall efforts to increase their efficiency and to better prepare its debates on external action.
I would also like to point out that, in all the positions adopted by the Council, there is no budgetary commitment on the part of the European Union to finance any military activity.
Furthermore, it is completely illogical that only the Council can amend the Financial Regulation, and we repeat our request for conciliation on this point.
On many points, as Mr Watts has already explained, the European Parliament is adopting a stricter position than appears to be the case in the Council.
Discussions have also been held with the sectors concerned and there have been many contacts with the French Presidency with a view to reaching a consensus text which can be quickly adopted by the two legislative bodies, the Council and the European Parliament.
I would like to say to Mr Jarzembowski that the Council is not seeking a compromise.
"It is clear that there can be an incompetent and provocative official, but if 15 Member States agree to such answers, Madam President, I believe you must take the initiative and urge the Council to respect a prerogative of Members of the European Parliament.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that with the debate on proportionality (votes in the Council and seats in Parliament), that is, on the balance of power between the Member States, a Pandora's box has been opened which will be difficult to close in Nice.
The report has been the subject of difficult discussions in the Council.
I have been told by my chairman of the Committee on Budgets that this is the first time ever that an agreement has been reached between the Council and Parliament in a conciliation.
Ultimately, it was the weighting of votes in the Council that was most hotly debated and where it was most difficult to reach a decision.
As a representative of the groups in the European Free Alliance, I would like to warn the Commission, and especially the Council, in the event that the EU does not want to be anything more than an intergovernmental community.
But the Nice European Council, like many other summits in the history of the European Union, represents a victory for reality, a victory for pragmatism over utopia.
If the Council wanted to do that, it would be reckless and ill-advised.
Secondly, has the Council had any information from the Council of Europe 's Commissioner for Human Rights, who is well represented on the ground?
What improvements will the Council make to Directive 92 / 12 / EEC, which is referred to here, so that the responsibilities of the supplier and the recipient are clearly defined without the possibility of fraud?
In accordance with Article 23 of the Treaty on European Union, such a decision is taken unanimously by the Council, as are all other decisions with defence implications.
Mr President, as rightly stated by the Groupement Européen des Sociétés d'Auteurs et de Compositeurs, the draft that we are discussing here has been grossly attacked in the course of its examination by the Council.
Secondly, this issue will be on the agenda of the Telecommunications Council next Friday.
It became clear at the trialogue meeting that the Council is not prepared to make concessions on this issue.
The precautionary principle was also discussed at the Nice Summit, which took note of a resolution adopted by the General Affairs Council.
The 2001 budget is largely based on a compromise between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, which we support.
The Nice European Council had a positive aspect: With the decision on a new weighting of votes and a new distribution of the Members of the European Parliament, including the candidate countries of Eastern Europe, it gave them a strong signal of its willingness to accept them as soon as possible.
Michelle Carter convicted of texts urging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentencing behind bars and five years have been suspended on probation.
Carter was convicted in June of the negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who took his life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is uncomforting.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy were suffering from a mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream-coloured blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and down-facing eyes as she was sentenced.
"Their actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
'she ended his life to make her own better.
She has not taken any responsibility, "she said.
'she didn't show any remorse. '
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "terrible circumstance that she completely regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find out that their "age or degree of maturity or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother Lynn Roy saying that there is "no day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters despite all the pain we will carry with us for eternity, "it reads.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
"No longer having this only person I've been with every day since I was born is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to call on another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang up, jump from a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case through any press.
The case has divided legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British roommate in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, who is 30 years old, posted a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."

Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-lame of FC Bayern
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run up as captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence.
The FC Bayern is confident of a great season for the Confed Cup winner - extra motivation does not hurt.
Something was different on his seat in the cabin, that saw Joshua Kimmich immediately, even if the additional garment was very, very small.
But as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup there was of course no Philipp Lahm and also no Manuel Neuer to be seen, he made the bond assigned to him stop at his arm.
"The coach didn't announce it," said the Confed Cup winner afterwards, after his first deployment as Bayern captain.
Well, the score could have been better than the 0: 2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign from the coach could also interpret Kimmich like this.
It was not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal who had been chosen as the game leader in the C-Elf, made up of youth players, debutants and professionals who had just come out of their holidays.
After all, sugar is best distributed to those to whom one trusts a lot, who one wants to keep happy.
So anyone who has been chosen to take on the legacy of Lahm can only make good use of a little extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: To take responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flitted across the field as a mini-lahm.
Right at the back, this is now his position, the white bandage on his arm did the rest.
And in general, in this initial formation Kimmich seemed like the one who can take the helm in the best hand.
He gave instructions, tried to direct the unseeded troupe.
He had the look for the whole, while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal used to overplay his lack of fitness (hardly worked out); Renato Sanches made use of the performances of the trip to Asia (even if only partially); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle didn't seem negative in their first appearance in the Bavarian jersey.
After all, that worked out quite well.
Süle ran up next to Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defense, both acting sovereign.
The well-known Napoli storm often had a hard time, and Süle also tried to build up a game a few times.
His colleague Rudy admittedly admitted that the result "was not as we hoped it would be."
But he, too, showed a decent performance at the debut.
Game shift, tempo change: "I was also brought in for this style."
How unusual this Bavarian world is for the new entrants, you saw after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few crisp statements in the back of his new fellow players.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "I have already noticed what is going on here.
At Bayern you just have to win every game. '
After all, he no longer has to teach the new.
Alaba motivates ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's most famous footballer signed up on Twitter shortly before the game and wished the ÖFB ladies all the best.
After all, the Bavarian Legionnaire is a club-mate of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and has a lot of fun with our Ladys.
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational injection.
Our ladies might well need the famous Bayern-Dusel, too.
In court it became known that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after drugs of class A had been discovered in his hair, his wallet and on his credit cards during tests.
In court, it became known that he had called key drug traffickers, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed them of what investigators knew about them.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
In court, the defendant initially claimed he was suffering from severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan next to him died in an explosion.
The court no longer had to hear any of the aggrieved women.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and also considered that the health law's requirement that states either expand the conditions of access to Medicaid or otherwise cut all state Medicaid subsidies was not unconstitutional.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the court to cheer on the new president, and unlike the Mubarak-era presidential runoff, traffic was halted only briefly so that the autoconvoy could cross the usually busy road connecting the city centre with the southern suburbs.
However, by taking the official oath before the court and not, as usual, before Parliament, he is bowing to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
What is difficult is that in court, rockers almost always abide by a law which has been laid down for them - and do not testify.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate minister: Economy praises Wissings pace
It often turned out to be irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Greens) was still Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Economy Minister Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak at T V request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Trier Companies Association (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked."
Natus sees the biggest U-turn in infrastructure policy: The gap in motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's list of priorities.
Later this year, the ministry hopes for a planning assessment process, by 2021 the building law should stand.
The West Bypass Trier, which is in urgent need of the Federal Road Map, also plays a role in the country's plans.
The aim is to get the line up and running in December 2020, says Ministry spokesperson Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a signpost to support regional but internationally competing companies.
As recommended by Wissing, the Trier Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) strives for a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine, in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports, which has been sagging for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praises the IHK.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new master bonus as an additional incentive for young apprentices, says managing director Matthias Schwalbach.
There will be a premium of 1000 Euros for the masters exam and 2500 Euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years of their master training.
The homework list for the country remains long, however.
According to Jan Glockauer, chief executive of the IHK Trier, the country lacks the necessary personnel when it comes to the planned road construction.
So far, only 29 of the 56 new engineers Wissing wants to employ for mobility at the national company have been filled.
The IHK is calling for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
Christian Baldauf, member of the CDU Group, refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country is investing more than EUR 20 million less in the maintenance of national roads in 2017 and 2018 than it has proposed.
Frank Natus is also awaiting a concept from the country on how to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
The broadband expansion in the country to date is also sobering.
In 2016, regional companies had rated network supply only with the grade 3.4 in an IHK survey.
They complained about stalled internet connections and abortions.
Ex-Minister of Economy Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is out of politics at the moment and still sits on the board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where, after four months, she already cleared the field again because of disagreements.
These lessons have taught them so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who through the low birth rate and the aging population suddenly began to change course this summer, encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their response was immediate and definitive: "By no means."

Audi set to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - automakers face a backlash
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believed that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the companies as a recall.
European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered to be carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to car manufacturers of installing equipment to neutralise exhaust emissions from diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of spoiling the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes, which include the use of so-called shutdown devices that could regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car has been tested but drive back in normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been indicted, while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in Audi's engine development was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was included in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was expanded.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: The luxury car manufacturer makes a disproportionate contribution to Volkswagen's profit.
Instead of immediately helping to establish humanitarian structures in the Röszke camp, our Federal Chancellor has put the Hungarian Government's position in the dark of National Socialism in a highly official and public manner.
When negotiations began six months ago, it was Britain's turn to take over the presidency of the European Council.
This is exactly what the European Commission did recently when it presented its first strategy for the post-Kyoto era, which the European Council will discuss in March.
The Commission's role is to monitor the practical application of this legal framework in the context of its role as defined by the Treaty.
I therefore believe that it is entirely appropriate, in this case, to entrust this task to an external and morally unquestionable authority.
That remains a task for the future.
Madam President, the question has been raised of what the role of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs might be.
Enlargement has presented you and all of us with the same task that Monnet and Schuman and others faced 50 years ago: To develop a method, a structure and a vision for the future of Europe.
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order that the Isar visitors also take part, a raft passes through Munich tomorrow, Saturday, which has a special message.
If you are drawn to the Isar river again on Saturday, you will see a big raft there between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is not a usual raft, with Isar tourists.
But the construction department wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a big infra-party.
It shows a rubbish mountain.
The prelude to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True love is..." the understanding of the Isar as a protected wild flow is to be sharpened.
Already last summer the raft drove over the Isar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behavior.
The European Monetary Cooperation Fund (ERC), chaired by a Governing Board consisting of members of the Committee of Governors of the Central Banks and a member of the Commission, has the main task of ensuring the functioning of the European Monetary System (EMS), created in March 1979 as a replacement for the "snake."
However, this monetary mechanism of the EMS differs from that of the "snake" in that the EMS has been accepted by all Member States (with the United Kingdom and Greece not yet participating in the intervention mechanism) and is therefore a Community system.
However, this monetary mechanism of the EMS differs from that of the "snake" in that the EMS has been accepted by all Member States (with the United Kingdom and Greece not yet participating in the intervention mechanism) and is therefore a Community system.
This was the mechanism that became famous under the name "snake in the tunnel" (European currency snake).
The "snake" represented the narrower fluctuation band allowed for intra-Community currency exchanges, whereas the term "tunnel" meant the greater fluctuation band allowed for the exchange of Community currencies into dollars.
In the meantime, the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (established in 1973 to manage the snake in the bandwidth mechanism) continues to serve as a precursor to the new institution.
It is forbidden to hunt, catch, disturb, kill, acquire alive or dead, damage, sell, transport or hand over fully protected animals (in Upper Austria these are most birds and snakes as well as all lizards and amphibians).
Banotti just something that he cares more about snakes than about horses.
He's done a lot for our snakes, but he hasn't cared about our horses. '
I have too much respect for the dogs, the snakes are supposed to fizz, our caravan moves on with the quiet certainty that every extra-European invasion in the Occident was followed by a Poitiers, a Lepante, a Vienna.
Objectives c. In 1972, thanks to the 'snake in the tunnel' mechanism, the fluctuation margins between the Community currencies (queue) were reduced compared to the fluctuation margins between these currencies and the dollar (tunnel).
They joined the price stability mechanism and left again, and the snake, originally conceived as a Community-wide agreement, was reduced to a zone of monetary stability around the DM.
(Snake) to ± 2.25% and to limit the fluctuation margins between these currencies and the dollar (tunnel) to ± 4.5%.
Community weighting at 2.25% (the "snake ") continued to be applied by the original Member States of the Community and Denmark, with the fluctuation band of these currencies against the dollar (the" tunnel ") limited to 4.5%.
The return of the French franc to the queue, the relatively satisfactory functioning of this system and the introduction of a European unit of account were characteristic of this development.
In 1975, negotiations were held on the incorporation of the Swiss franc into the "snake" in order to contribute to greater exchange rate stability in Europe.
The logical consequence of this was that difficulties repeatedly arose on the foreign exchange markets: The French franc withdrew from the "queue," the pounds and lira suffered heavy losses on the international currency markets, and the German mark was upgraded to relieve the queue.
Adjustment of the intervention rate within the "queue "; the central rate of the DM will be upgraded by 2% compared to the ERE.
Within the "snake," two exchange rate adjustments were made, both of which concerned the Scandinavian currencies.
While this was reduced in the setting of prices for 1978 / 79, it was increased again as a result of exchange rate changes in floating currencies and revaluations within the queue.
During the start-up period of the system, Member States not participating in the queue may opt for some further bandwidth for a limited period of time.
The question remains whether it will be able to resist the ups and downs that brought down the "snake."
The former "floated," the latter were integrated into the snake and could only fluctuate within a given frame.
In the EMS, the unit of account for the "snake" is replaced by the ECU, which corresponds to the value of the ERE and is therefore about 21% below the value of the "snake billing unit."
However, the United Kingdom and Ireland, followed by Italy, are leaving the "snake."
The European Rut, however, has also had undeniable successes: The British renegotiations of 1975. the general election of the European Parliament and, on 12 March 1979, the introduction of the European Monetary System (EMS), which replaced the 'snake'.
This construction became known as the 'snake in the tunnel', with the fluctuations between the Community currencies forming the snake and the external fluctuation limits allowed by the IMF.
The three candidate countries, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark, joined the queue in May 1972, but failed to comply with the discipline and left the queue after a few months.
At the beginning of 1974, France and Italy also left the queue, which thus consisted only of a small number of currencies under the leading position of the Deutschmark.
This was the birth of the "snake in the tunnel."
The snake was therefore half as wide (2.25%) as the tunnel (4.5%).
It was also decided that interventions aimed at keeping European currencies in line should in principle be carried out in European currencies, whereas dollar intervention should only be allowed in order to prevent the queue from breaking out of the tunnel.
The EEC Commission subsequently proposed a common floating of European currencies against the dollar - that is, the maintenance of the snake, which was supposed to leave the tunnel - including the possibility of changing parities within the queue within certain limits and under certain conditions.
In September 1974, French Finance Minister Fourcade proposed a plan for "concerted floating" of all Community currencies in order to achieve closer coordination between the five snake currencies and the four separate floating currencies.
As a starting point, he recommended the previous snake, but wanted to surround it with a kind of broader and more elastic "boa" in which the European currencies outside the queue would be included.
This outer shell could have wider bandwidths than the snake and include a possible option for the entry and exit of the currencies.
In December 1975, the Belgian Prime Minister, Mr Tindemans, in his report on the European Union, developed a series of proposals aimed at consolidating the snake, which was to be of a Community nature and extend its action to the key areas of economic and monetary policy.
Leo Tindemans believes that the reinforcement of the queue should also encourage a gradual return to greater international monetary stability, the first stage of which should be the creation of larger stability zones in the world where exchange rates would be kept stable.
This target zone for floating currencies should gradually move towards the snake as the weighting would shift in favour of the snake.
Some may regard the European Monetary System as nothing more than an extended and re-christened 'snake'.
As with the snake, membership of the EMS is voluntary.
Although France, Italy and Ireland decided to participate alongside the former snake countries (i.e. BR Germany, Denmark and the Benelux countries), Britain decided in 1978 to remain outside the exchange rate mechanism, which is the essential part of the EMS.
The obligations associated with participation are broadly similar to those that existed within the queue: A currency may fluctuate by no more than 2.25% on either side of its bilateral parity (for the Italian lira, however, it is currently 6%).
- The distance between these two ECU courses serves as the basis for calculating the deviation indicator, which is a novelty of the EMS compared to the snake.
It has been discussed for a long time whether the intervention requirement should be established in relation to the ECU or using the parity grid, following the example of the snake.
However, Member States which did not join the queue in December 1978 (namely France, Italy and Ireland) were able to choose larger bandwidths of up to 6%.
- Internal monetary policies: These include, in particular, interest-rate policies that directly affect capital movements and can contribute to easing tensions, as experience with the "snake" has amply demonstrated.
The mechanism of the deviation indicator has thus brought two important innovations in relation to the snake system: For the first time there is an objective basis for the initiation of consultations between the competent authorities; this goes well beyond the mere principle of consultations left to the initiative of the participants.
Entry into force of the Basel Agreement, which introduces a system of reduced bandwidths in the EEC - the queue (bandwidths of 2.25%) in the tunnel (+ 2.25%).
The pound sterling, the Irish pound and the Danish krone join the queue.
The Danish krone leaves the snake.
The Italian lira leaves the snake.
The Norwegian and the Swedish krona join the snake.
The Swedish krona leaves the queue; the Danish and Norwegian krona depreciate by 5% against the Irish.
Norway is leaving the snake.
Chapter II summarises these earlier attempts, from the formulation of a number of objectives in the Treaty of Rome to the concerted floating of certain European currencies in the "snake."
Chapter III discusses in detail the content of the EMS and its mechanisms (exchange rate and intervention mechanism, role of the ECU, credit systems), highlighting in particular the innovations of these mechanisms in relation to the "snake" and analysing the conditions for proper functioning in the abstract.
During the start-up period of the system, Member States not participating in the queue may opt for some further bandwidth for a limited period of time.
Two areas of Community activity had hitherto been excluded from the scope of the ERE: The transactions of the European Monetary Cooperation Fund, which were genuine, a unit of account based on the central rates of the snake currencies, and the common agricultural policy, which used the "representative rates" fixed in national currencies.
The candidate countries are also joining the "queue."
The English and Irish pounds leave the queue.

Mordillos Knollennasen and laughing against suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoon draftsmen, the Knollennases of his figures are his trademark.
Even at 85, the Argentinian is still drawing and working on a film.
His message: Laugh, "because there is too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born in Buenos Aires on August 4, 1932, the son of Spanish immigrants.
In his first years as an artist he worked as a draftsman for congratulatory cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when lost into my job," he once said.
After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough at the end of the 60s: With the release of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, round Mordillo figures tumble in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
According to his own statements, he is still sitting at the drawing table in the early morning, working almost ten hours a day.
Through calendars, puzzles, books for adults and children, T-shirts, plush toys and watches, his droll figures continue to find a lot of distribution worldwide.
For six years he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters.
The main person in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousandfold as his opponent.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which is set to hit the cinema screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
That's why he relies more on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced without a word.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 on fulfilling its obligations, France spends just 10 cents and that means a comparable effort.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
He has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining due to drought-related conditions and disease-borne insects, which is a major headache for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the life of lavender.
There is also a small cicade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are a lot of them. "
And there is a lot at stake.
Lavender oil is not only attractive for holidaymakers, it is also in great demand for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: 'Instead of having very long plant clocks with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "
The solutions being considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
We wanted to win and we won, although I'm sorry we didn't score one or two more goals. '

The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
Employees of the weekly Riodoce usually meet Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa caused by organized crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety.
They have been told it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: They should take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a plaque at the front of the room: Opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings range.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the government's payroll or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no respite from the violence, and while bodies are piling up across the country, more and more journalists are participating: At least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far this year there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter is her editor and her inspirator of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in their thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts typical of the panamel.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special Federal Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, it has initiated only two criminal proceedings.
As with most of the thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year, journalists' murderers are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting for discussing security has little benefit, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
'as long as we don't know the why, we distrust everyone. '
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and shot at him 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated as "Twelfth River."
The gunman drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two grown-up children.
Rumours tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is virtually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as rival factions here struggle to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa, someone or several people are shot in the street every day or that the cemetery is full of ordained, two-story mausoleums for drug royalty that are larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "calm" when only one cartel has control of the coastal state with its precious ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Still, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, has broken with guilt for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two misconceptions contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival antitrust factions at war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected gang members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He was an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined forces with five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold $50 worth of holdings.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to engage in journalism without encountering the narcotics problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were intrigued by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to deal with.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she was awarded the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Prize" for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in prosecuting Mexican drug history wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October.
'you have to take on the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you're playing the stupid.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in the face of so many deaths... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team is missing Valdez, the joker who could curse like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his spoiling?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result is, even in the best of times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials reside.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where the employees of Riodoce met for security training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. Days before, it became known that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were mandated by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half in jest, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 percent of police officers that the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It's been months since the reporters went to the mountainside, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's edition, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the assassination of the brother of former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government spending focused on the governor's home town.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word on who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was needed when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows: That the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels for almost the entire century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in that eatery, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have viewed Valdez's column as the best-informed source about the kidnapping.
"Before, we would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, using the nickname "El Flaco" because of its slim body board.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez's office has been rededicated to the storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists because the staff have become something they themselves would never have expected: Activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning because of another journalist to the prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame went missing three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.
A cremated body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.
Across the country, journalists have become more vocal by writing down "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and trying there to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez's assassination, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them because they told the truth.
She has since asked for it to be reclassified by the government because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organized crime, government officials involved in it and an indifferent society.
In his last book, "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were in cahoots with organized crime.
The media watchdog group "Articulo 19" last year assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to police and officials.
"In Mexico, you're dying because they want you to keep your mouth shut," Ramirez said.
Apparently, the killings have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel saying: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the headline "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their home states or even the country.
It is a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as is apparently the case for photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it's a daily dance with risky choices.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking frightens him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last edition had already ended, Riodoce's editors were sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office and drinking beer when all of a sudden all their phones began to buzz.
A series of shootings involving gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a series of cartel embassies in the region.
From the curb, they posted the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens howled nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the police officers who were holding guard to see if they were in readiness.
If they were afraid at all, they didn't show it.
Under the powerful portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa, Riodoce's staff followed in his footsteps.
"How can you even think of closing," Bojorquez said, "when on the same day Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her out to the streets for reporting."
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling had "missed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing the decisions until after the election.

"The significant announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, an economic adviser at auditing firm Deloitte.
After the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were detained in Iran and dozens killed, leading to the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Disgraced presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some protesters who had been detained after the election were tortured to death in prison in August and others were raped.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the post-election riots and the government's reactions to them, but said Amnesty, the mandates and power of these bodies would be unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been made public.
Eide has rejected all the accusations, but he also said that the allegations made by Galbraith - who was fired - "undoubtedly harmed the mission because there was already a great deal of scepticism about international interference in the election."
Having separated from Georgia during the conflict of 1992-1993, in which several thousands of people died, Abkhazia wants to use this election to prove that it is ready to join the international community.
Thus, until shortly before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was scourged.

"If you ask me for advice," she said after she finished her prayer and set her face free again, "so I advise you not to do it.
"Please, just follow my advice," said the old princess; "put a sheet of paper over the paste and moisturize it with rum, then it will never mold without ice."
On Levin's advice, Darja Alexandrovna left before sunrise.
But a decent medical treatment and seaside resorts in the summer have restored his health, and now I have given him on the advice of the doctor to school.
The affairs of Sergei Ivanovitch and the sister and the peasants who came to him to seek advice, and had become fully accustomed to no longer taking care of these matters, were just as impossible for Levin as it is impossible to throw in a child who is already held in arms.

Dinosaur used camouflage to dodge his enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
Now researchers have found that the first findings of a Canadian miner's incredible rhino have been so well preserved that experts have described it as the "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
It was so well preserved they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had had something of a "troubled past."
The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurier that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well-preserved condition has stunned researchers who describe it as "truly remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He encountered something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) heavy ground clump.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you just blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it has slept," said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
'it will go down in scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs. '
Researchers have found that although this herbivore is covered with an armor and resembles a walking tank, it has probably been threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to blend better into its environment and dodge its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurian family first made headlines in May and can now be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it.
The astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor across his body.
They discovered countershading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although countershading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from flesh-eating dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use counter-shading - think deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signalling that this nodosaur was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur's skin was red-brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved intestinal content, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe the dinosaur, when he died, ran into a river and was driven out into the sea, where it sank on its back to the seabed.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but is also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal today looks almost the same as in the early Cretaceous period.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you just look a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is sleeping. "
The Cretaceous period was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, passed through the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of its fearsome ancestors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-ton monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank in the sea after death and was mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armour, and is complete from snout to hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long spikes that raced off his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored herbivore waded through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy tank plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as' rare as a win in the lotto.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it gets.
Petrified remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy tank plates that carry the animal's skull.

In thunderstorm: Mass carambolage on A8: Many injured
Violent accident on Thursday night on the A8: Just under 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.
There are numerous injured, mile-long traffic jams - and gaffers.
About 20 people were injured in a mass carambolage on the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8) late Thursday afternoon.
According to initial police data, nearly 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, crashed between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg district) during a thunderstorm at around 5pm.
Initially, no information was available on the exact number of injured persons.
They were minor to moderate injuries, said a police spokesman.
A large number of emergency vehicles were at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.
A ten-kilometre long backlog formed in the direction of Munich.
As an AZ reporter reports, massive disabilities also occurred on the opposite lane - due to numerous gaffers.
The fire brigade took note of the characteristics of the drivers, who are now facing severe penalties.
Shortly after 6: 45 p.m. a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There had been a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "comfort check-in"
It's a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: Nothing unsuspecting you sit on the train and sleep.
Or you are engrossed in his work and just have an ingenious thought.
And then: Pufff.
If the conductor comes and wakes you up, or rips the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the days of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the seamless ticket control.
One simply confirms by mobile phone that one has taken his place and thus devalues the ticket.
A test operation is currently running on two routes.
"If the offer arrives, we extend it.
It is then expected to be available on many more long-distance routes in Germany early next year, "a rail spokesman said.
"Comfort Check-in," the train calls the ticket devaluation without a conductor.
In order to be able to use them, however, some prerequisites must be met: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to have booked an online ticket - which is already what most passengers do anyway.
You also have to buy it via the app of the train, the DB Navigator, which is anyway the most convenient way to book a ticket.
And finally you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: You get on the train, call your ticket under "My Tickets."
A button for electronic devaluation will then appear with the test customers.
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that Passenger X is on the train and has taken the seat Y booked.
If the train attendant arrives at number Y during ticket inspection, he knows that there is a passenger with an already devalued online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, continue working, keep silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: One for the customer, one for the railway - which in turn should benefit the passengers.
"If you want to travel in a relaxed way without ticket control by our train attendants, simply check in yourself at the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to make their travel time on the train more personal, "says Michael Peterson, marketing director of DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."
Those who travel by train often know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are one of the biggest annoyances.
Because often you yourself, but in any case one of the passengers does not have all the documents you need for the devaluation of online tickets.
Either there is no credit card or identity card or any other document to show.
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large area and delays in controlling your own ticket, and the conductor ultimately takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And this only applies to the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen connections.
Additional numbers on the same route are not yet available.
How one activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just a day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis-born sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled across a post from someone from high school.
"The police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it is still lying on the street," it said there.
Confused, as no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retweetet on her timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis area was in the process of tweeting live the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body, which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She dropped off her mobile phone to return later in the evening to tweets about people on the Canfield drive.
There were photos of the police tape and people screaming, and of a man claiming to be Brown's father, who carried a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another police officer unlocked his rifle and screamed, "I will kill you... animals all."
"This is not common," Ferrell recalled of her statement.
'that's not the kind of murder we've become accustomed to and that we can call typical. '
At that moment I felt chills.
I was angry and crying. '
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11pm, she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would head to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the following three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from the 11th.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience, comprised from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and matching crown, the two discussed a conversation they had countless times before that morning "about the black experience and the black state."
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" She recalled what she said.
'we're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take them, "Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a culmination of... what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and be brought up in it.
It needs to be well developed, to know not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution, and what we need to do to become free to liberate ourselves.
Even though I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women's child.
I feel like I'm doing her a disservice to keep her away from it. '
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a site opposite the police authority that became a camping area as the activists waited for the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who was making lunch.
They prepared pockets and helped pass them on to protesters.
Slowly, a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to take shape.
"My activism totally changed after August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come. '
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or do you try to find a story that you can exploit?"
This skepticism was fuelled by countless cases of people, often whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview, "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not centre their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around death row inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals following the team from "Whose Streets?" In the years following Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us. We talk," Davis said.
'that was the main thing for me, how these people are portrayed, because that's how I'm going to be portrayed. '
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement is "not a messiah leader, but a community coming together," Folayan said - it proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" Show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like I was nude," Ferrell said, laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time.
'but I've understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people. '
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders, who coined the film "BlackLivesMatter" on social media after the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," Ferrell said, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything. ""
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really held upright by black women and many black women."
However, she insists that "this is not an affirmatic type of action," in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who stirred up that energy," she said.
'it's no coincidence, although she was at the forefront because so much is at stake in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman.
You can feel their energy through the screen. "
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years for blocking a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A mess."
Still, she clings to a chant and she has been committed to that memory ever since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains. '
Two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
"Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all yellows on the same benches, spread out in the room!"
"Very little space has remained owned by the city and we would like Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it was re-paving the small street and setting up seats intended, among other things, for a café to which the company would like to rent space.
Thanks to a camera and a form and facial recognition system, this' receptionist 'can detect how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were clothed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
From "dream" to "megalomania ": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, although it is far from being built.
But the idea of a shopping center on the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been dividing the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
The topic hardly leaves you cold.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."
While some say to the bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), from the other side comes: "No man needs" (Siggi Betzen) or simply: "Megalomaniac!" (Lars Scholz).
While supporters are relying on a gallery to attract more customers to the city, which also benefits the rest of the shops, opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned precisely on the site of the farmer's market hall, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will come to an end at the beginning of the construction work.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - towards Beda Square with the possibility of sitting outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been shopping almost weekly in the farmer's market hall for many years now.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the rural women again and again very much.
We have also discovered the butchery for ourselves.
We would like there to be a chance to maintain this offer during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities there are.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the level of the rent.
But this will probably not be very low for the new project. "
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether it's clothing, shoes, drugstore or supermarkets, I think it's superfluous.
There's already enough of that in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some have been for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least retain the market hall.
After all, the product offered there is fresh, is mainly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not affordable for a retailer.
It's a pity, there are almost no special shops anymore and what is left of them will probably disappear. "
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall doesn't fit together for me.
And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the farmer's market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the ghost bit gallery manage to sell all the shops from Bitburg before? "
George Marquet: "This just won't work.
And a shopping center that stands empty, nobody needs either.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmers' market instead of this gallery.
But thanks to the unbelievably many - in my opinion - useless building projects in Bitburg, there is no longer any room for a farmer's market hall.
If the farmers "market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."
An apt resemblance: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, almost imperceptibly alike - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks-toppers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year prison sentence after she made public classified diplomatic notices through the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance (A fitting resemblance).
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose conviction was commuted by Barack Obama when he had only three days left in his post.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits of what someone with this genomic data might look like, has a sharp, if somewhat intellectual, commentary not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but has already spoken openly about identifying as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges, including six violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.
Through prison, her image was suppressed, so much so that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie in which Manning visibly sits unwell in a driver's seat and wears a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came back from the huge success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to create a picture of what these people might look like.
That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you made contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to do a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal pen friends, who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the president would transform Chelseas's judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would indeed demand Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, just days after the book was published, was a welcome kind of happy coincidence.
There is also something deep and strong now at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions he was supposed to fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with her outsized signature underneath (the "i" in her family name is emblazoned with a heart) called for an end to "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a millipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's highly developed scientific lexicon) how astonishingly similar, at least in biological terms, we all are.
"What people will hopefully take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data is to interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, can also be seen.
'DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of these stories. '
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the comic novella mentioned above.
She shows Manning as she emerges with a hands-free phone in hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King-Kong.
"If they cold your speech, then they won," it reads.
"So never stop your mouth."
"It came straight from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, greeting from Philadelphia.
"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she was to do so, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulacres, gathering like hordes of protesters.
That was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, right down to the size (5 "2, Manning's stature) at which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd of people," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
'i wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind its liberation. '
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford wanted for killing
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University who are being sought as a suspect after a man was stabbed to death with fatal injuries in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
On Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for murder over their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the files of the Cook County District Court show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.
A community warning system published by the Chicago Police Department says the corpse was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene of the incident, and detectives are investigating the stitches as murder, while police are actively looking for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem would now be on leave and had been barred from entering the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal matter that is being investigated by the relevant authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the US investigative authorities in any way possible."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to turn himself in.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urges the suspects to stand up to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received an enigmatic tip saying something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident had also taken place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza's management team released a statement to residents: "Police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving something back to those who made sacrifices.

When the music industry awarded the survivor of the Cologne group Can the Echo Prize for Lifetime Achievement in 2003, one saw in the room questioning German pop faces.
"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada).
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, Rusada has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard, "Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA's roadmap for complying with the code, which describes the criteria for re-establishing Rusada and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could be of concern to Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Referring to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation as our anti-doping system has admitted an error.
All the measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programs, and we're not going to admit something that doesn't exist. '
Mutko's words aligned with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
Speaking to the Russian outlet rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally, "Smirnov added.
Rusada was barred by WADA from carrying out doping checks in Russia in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.
However, it has been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli declared that Rusada was moving "in the right direction" to be reinstated.
In groups, new qualifications were acquired through the production and sale of hand-made cards, followed by visits to other companies.
Upon entering the Expo 98 construction site, it is necessary to show a card which is only issued to workers who have demonstrated that they are legally resident in the country and are registered with the social security system.
"Optical cards" can be easily connected to all computers and combined with other types of cards.
Roland Fastberg will take over the second part as he designs the applications for the maps.
There are different maps on the market, and the important thing is that we are talking about machine-readable maps here.
I have a functional map here and will hold it up once.
You could also put a magnetic strip on the map and would then have combined all three types of machine-readable cards in one card.
For some applications it might be important that today you can actually combine different technologies in one map.
Every now and then there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.

"The price-quality ratio at the time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for district heating vary from city to city.
However, the price in Prague is still one of the lowest in the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
(Unless otherwise stated, all prices are from Toys "R" Us.)
Even so, it foresees a slump in interest margins, which banks are trying to offset with increases in fees and prices for loans.
Even if he assumes that the war for liabilities - which penalises interest margins - will wane, the risk premiums that banks and savings banks will have to pay for their liquidity emissions to offset dwindling profit margins will already be passed on to the price of loans.
"They like to go out, but they pay close attention to prices," he points out.
Business will go well with those who "offer quality at good prices with a good service," he adds, reminding us that customers are saving in times of crisis, which is why prices are most in demand by 25 euros.
"If you make a tender and there are only a few candidates, your prices will go up."
"The idea, however, is that it is not the price that is decisive, but the expertise of the people," Laporte reiterated.
After the higher price of the products, this is the second brake identified by the barometer.
This is the price to protect the euro.
On Tuesday, in any case, the scissors with German interest rates had reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy had risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain degree of impotence in Rome.

Aldi no longer sells eggs for the time being
This was communicated by the groups of companies.
It is a purely precautionary measure and no further damage to health can be assumed, the communication states.
From now on, only eggs could be supplied to Aldi, which had been shown to have been tested negative for fipronilate-containing anti-lesions.
With this, Aldi wanted to create clarity and transparency for its customers.
If we do not have an urgent debate, this matter will be at the end of the queue of resolutions for the political committee, as happened with the resolution on Pakistan, which has not yet been discussed by this committee after three months.
Every minute of the working day, a further five people join the queue for unemployment benefit.
The fact that the fine-sounding concept of a common market does not mean much is demonstrated every day by the long queues of lorries at the internal frontiers of the EC.
In the United Kingdom, this distribution took place under inhumane conditions, as pensioners had to queue, as they did in the 1930s, to get their free packet of butter.
Logically, this causes inconvenience, since the queues of non-French travellers - quite contrary to the idea of 'grandeur', which may have inspired the officials who invented the system - are much longer than those of the nationals of the Member State to which the airport belongs.
In addition, the veterinary service ensured that lorries transporting live animals or perishable food were processed outside the queue, that the animals were soaked and given veterinary care and that the delays were kept to a minimum.
In fact, some are seriously hampered by blocked roads, and I myself was more than irritated when I had to wait in front of a military post in a long queue.
For example, voters who queued in 1000 m long were sent back home in the evening because there was no electric light.
As far as the number of Members of Parliament is concerned, I have long seen queues waiting to be able to use their cards.
The free movement of persons envisaged, which was to enter into force in 1993, with controls and uncivilised queues at the borders, certain bureaucratic practices and the presentation of passports
Part of a roadway that can be characterized by longitudinal markings and the wide enough ¡st for a queue of motor vehicles, except motorcycles.
The carrying out of these checks requires drivers of commercial vehicles to carry a large amount of documentation and to wait in queues in front of customs offices until their turn.
There are 2.792 unemployed workers on every vacant job in Sunderland, and more than half of school leavers from 1981 had not yet found a job when school leavers from 1982 joined the queue of jobseekers.
This last point may seem superfluous today, but so soon after the "bad times," which lasted until the 1950s, every politician was all too present with the empty shelves in the bakeries, the food cards and the long queues in front of the grocery stores.
In the United Kingdom, the practice is very different, that is, there are both real personal conversations and the so-called 'cattle market', where teachers sit at school tables and parents queue up to be able to change a few short, more or less empty words with the teacher in question.
If adequate content is available, citizens would "prefer to 'work online' rather than queue," Liikanen told CORDIS News.
At the end of 2000, however, the consumer who wanted to pay in euros often came across cashiers who - not accustomed to it - had to consult their superiors in order to be able to process the payment, while he himself took the impatient gaze of the customers waiting in the queue.
Hence the snake.
The motto of "eGovernment" could be: "It is better to sit at the computer than to stand in line," because eGovernment is in fact supposed to make it easy to run public services over the Internet, so that we no longer have to queue in the offices.
As a result, aircraft are often forced to take a long detour to reach their destination or to "queue" for the use of the corridors.
The EU-funded sculpteur project opens up new ways to visit the major European galleries and museums, so that endless snakes and tired feet will soon be a thing of the past.
The handling procedures need to be streamlined and simplified so that long queues of lorries no longer hinder border traffic between Kaliningrad and the neighbouring regions of Poland and Lithuania.
As a result, long queues form on the winding coastal road leading into the village.
We are becoming more and more aware of the loss of quality of life we are suffering as a result of traffic congestion, queues and standing in front of closed shops, libraries and public authorities.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, a meeting he had refused with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election; however, that figure dropped from 78 percent last month.
They would find it better if he didn't win the election, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's good."
The start-ups that will help your business not to become the next Uber
Amy errett wanted to gauge the happiness of your employees at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn't work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There was just never consistency and objectivity," said errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair care company Madison Reed.
She has called people from the outside for help.
A new breed of human resources start-ups is on the rise to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, target specific groups and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to contact the C-Suite executives directly.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" Said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat map of the firm that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives show low approval results - so you can drill down on why.
Companies are coming to realise that they need to stay at the forefront of workplace culture so that you don't become the next Uber embroiled in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who spoke out have been punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could own more than $118.7 billion in value in 2020, according to financial technology website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a rising interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber case in disrepute.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send tailor-made "pulse" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and look at the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And when the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the supervisory board.
"The court of public opinion has grasped the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.
If a company is found to be treating its employees poorly or behaving unethically, it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycotts, employee fluctuation and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has deployed Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays general counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of staff.
Now that the company uses Convercent, problems that were previously hidden by executives who sat in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair internships - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience with employment," said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations caused by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took for the "social media to come to their right" that companies realized you couldn't prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, and charge companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the total capital to $47 million.
Glitter secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its total funding to $60 million.
These investments come as little surprise, given the connected nature of business, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research showing that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices belong, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, both used by Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies are doing well. Companies are doing well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and use, it's no wonder you'll find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture important.
But the data is useless if a company's administrators do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change does not come quickly enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.
"Because if you don't follow staff will be wondering," Have you really heard me?
Do you care?
And who you don't care about, why should I? '
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate action on the same day when a problem is reported on Glint, according to errett.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the issues.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insights about employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to better bonding of workers in an industry known for high sales.
"If you are not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
'and if you lose people, you lose customers too.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose businesses.

The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of camp almost a week after last season and carried out practical exercises during the summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons at Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 exercises during August. 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their opener against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he supported the NCAA's rule change, even if it added another point to the players "busy routes.
"We put this enormous strain on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
'and they just pushed it through, they keep placking themselves up, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it's going to be really great. '
UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished, which won't be an easy task given the clear lines of view of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been pelted with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a goal post.
Bruins players are due to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora acknowledged that there could be a problem once those rooms are vacant during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
'that's a real problem, and it's not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then adjust there to record an exercise.
If you have the videotape of an exercise, it's a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking lot 8.
We will do the best we can with what we have.
I am not too worried about that.
We have a plan. ""

The Community assistance consists of food, medicines and blankets.
Medicines, staples, blankets and clothing are needed to improve people's terrible situation.

This does not necessarily mean an integral standardisation of information collection systems in all Member States, but the adoption of a common standard in terms of definitions and methods; this need does not conflict with the need to retain a certain flexibility in the definition of the ceiling, which must be applied concretely in each Member State and for each legislative provision.
The quantitative data on textile tissues in gm in some countries and elsewhere, or the data on blankets in kg in some countries and in others, make it impossible to evaluate business statistics for the internal market.

They discovered that certain human activities, such as combustion of fossil fuels, deforestation and increasing emissions of pollutants from cars, planes and ships change the nature of the atmosphere and condense the ceiling of greenhouse gases (1), which naturally surrounds the Earth and help prevent heat from escaping.
They assume that an atmospheric ceiling of COS, which is more effective than CO2, would already have been enough to compensate for 30% of the energy not supplied by the sun.
By doing so, it had favoured the emergence of lives that destroyed it, such as the ozone (O3) the ultraviolet radiation. But how can we explain the icing of the earth 2.5 billion years ago with such a ceiling?

Facebook wants to step up fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to factual verifiers from third parties and display their results under the original post then, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday. It is one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in an opinion piece on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect possible misreporting and send it to factual verifiers who may be displaying results of fact-checking from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe it also influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to May's presidential election, and Germany is backing a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings as they did before the September elections there.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review would be launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to realizing what stories are being contested by factual verifiers of third parties, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "related article" and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news.
Creating a comic novel: A castle in the history of England
In its more recent past, little Scotney Castle was featured in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970's and 1980's.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of tumultuous history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I think it's so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
'What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand. '
'a Castle in England 'spans the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It's not the first book by Rhodes based on an archive: He wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I just reacted to the thumb print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700's who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"This is his thumb print!
And letters always smell of smoke, because at that time they lit a fire because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if it were also there.
Ah, I love archives! "
For someone so smitten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months (" To be honest: I've overrated my welcome a little bit ") this all seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, sifting through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyenic pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He wandered through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscapers, gardeners and sometimes the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "Whiskey and began to write."
Scotney's intimate history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only gained full access in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees were just beginning to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said," Oh, throw it in the attic. "
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps that depict who owned what: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch around which two families fought.
Guys, let everything go his gear! "
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to delve into English history on a broader basis, including 'The labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of an uproar that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book titled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising started in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected? "
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as' The Priest ', which tells the story of the Jesuit priest, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', depicting 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney: "The Lords seemed to be quite crooks, getting into debt again and again and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their school crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking guys, with a talent to advertise heirs. '
After the end of his work in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has spent a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go back," he says.
It was like, "Ah, now I have to cope with the damn life again."

Campaign launched: Over 300-year-old Marienkapelle shrouded in Rhöndorf
With the unveiling of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign to introduce a new roof brand (Thursday's roundshow) on Friday.
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Too beautiful for us.
Or?, "ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel.
"We don't really think so (of course!)," they write on their website released yesterday.
'but we're using this measure to attract your attention.
And to make it clear that something is better than it seems.
Basically, we strongly believe that we, as citizens of Bad Honnefer, are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city. "
The action is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it continues.
"It is important to make a single promise, one that gives the city a distinctive unique selling point."
After all, it is in competition with other municipalities.
A medium five-digit amount can cost the city of Bad Honnef its new umbrella brand and the campaign.

"I don't believe that," said the dove; "but if they do, then they are a kind of snake, that much I know."
This was something so new for Alice that she kept silent for a few minutes; the dove took the opportunity and continued: "You're looking for eggs, I know that only too well, and what do I care if you're a little girl or a snake?"
"The spectacle, and the devil with the flame-lands!" He cried out of his body, turning like a snake around his column-bang.

This will include further measures to address various issues such as the gender pay gap, women's participation in the labour market, vocational training, overcoming "private glass" and blanket participation in decision-making.
Gender differences in pay, greater participation of women in the labour market, the glass ceiling, work-life balance and participation in the decision-making process - these are just some of the issues in the field of gender equality where further progress is needed.
Figure 3.6 Porous materials can be mounted on the walls of the workshop for the dampening of high-frequency sound or hung on the ceiling as a baffle.
Sound absorbing material can be mounted in different ways: Hanging of baffles (left) (which creates a large absorption surface), complete or partial cladding of walls and ceiling (right).
The "glass ceiling" still ensures that only a few women rise to decision-making positions.
In addition, there is the so-called "glass ceiling" - the invisible barrier that keeps women away from the better-paid positions in management.
But while social policy more or less encourages women's participation in the labour market, business models - traditionally developed by men - form the pillars that ensure that the so-called "glass ceiling" remains firmly anchored and impenetrable for women.

Ministry wants to refurbish track for racing shuttle
Time and again in the past few months there have been arguments about the future of the racing steep shuttle - now it should be done very quickly.
Before the end of the year, the marooned route on which the tourist railway runs is to be built.
In order to secure the future of the race steep shuttle in the long term, construction work on the track is scheduled to begin later this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to continue ordering and refurbishing the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committing itself to this important link, especially for tourism," stated Transport Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
He estimated the cost of repairing the route at about 2.5 million euros.
Of that total, the country takes over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle will continue to be ordered by the country, is currently being finalised, said Sühl.
The Ministry and the Südthüringen Bahn as operator are already in agreement on the technical details.
"This means that the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards have been negotiated," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company was concluded for a period of eleven years.
This means that the race platform shuttle should be ordered on a regular basis on December 2017.
The race platform shuttle is a rail link between Ilmenau and Rennsteig train stations, which is particularly popular with tourists.
In recent months, a pilot operation had tested whether the route would be used by a sufficient number of people to re-order it regularly in the future.
The track is also highly dilapidated in parts.

It's been proven that, despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.

"An inferiority complex almost inherent in Canadians may make Canadian political leaders much more likely to talk about everyday domestic issues than pass the buck to the United States in this election (like the Free Trade Campaign in 1988)," he says.

Madam President, there are new victims of ETA, but there are also new victims of Spanish oppression: New arrests, new torture, relocation of prisoners incarcerated in the Basque country.
Firstly, there is the method; it is a forceful and opaque procedure for the public, which in reality excludes the other institutions of the Union and in which the governments fall victim to their own labyrinth.
Many victims are small children, terrible impressions, terrible mutilations, the path of life destroyed before it has started properly.
We must ensure that those who have become innocent victims of the fight against crime - perhaps we should call it collateral damage - do not languish in complete isolation from their relatives in the prisons.
However, in the face of this crisis, we must guarantee both health and food safety for consumers and the income of livestock farmers, as well as the income of butchers, caldaine dealers and wholesalers, who have all been victims of the negligence of national and Community authorities.
Appropriate measures must be taken to guarantee victims of crime the following rights: The right to submit and receive information; the guarantee of communication; participation in the procedure and access to free legal aid; adequate protection of the person and privacy; the right to criminal compensation and the possibility of settling disputes through arbitration.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just when you thought it can't get even crazier in 2017, comes a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yes, indeed.
Sex robots are a big deal at the moment.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, professor emeritus of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
"People make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we'll get to see them a lot more often," Mr Sharkey said at the release of his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicon skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved through artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customize" his robot according to his beliefs, selecting everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots own the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicon skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible," True Companion's website enthuses.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods during the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixated on conversation or she can be "in the mood"! "
There are many worrying aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient feminine traits, the allusions to rape when taking a step on Frigid (meaning here: Reluctant) Farrah, worry one the most.
On his website, True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?" The website reads.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.
Most men, of course, will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their rising popularity, they remain on the fringes of consumer culture for the time being.
But what seeps out of the fringes can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these sophisticated sex robots are emerging at a time when women's rights are under threat around the world, when there is a president in the White House who has boasted of sexually assaulting women.
The most chilling aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') is not the graphic images, the muffled bodies and the outcast eyes, but how realistic this vision is.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with porn star proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.
But, in a nutshell, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots do not represent real women.
They can't separate from their companion or just leave.
They have no mediation or a background story, nothing that hints at independence or anything that might interfere with the fantasy of total submission.
In other words, they are happy slaves.
Or to put it in the phrase of 2017: Maids
So I will depart lightly in the awareness that the orchestra will continue its successful course.

After all, anyone who enforces the narrow, legendary, famously error-intolerant course is one of the winners anyway.
While they love Le Mans, the "Green Hell" of the Nürburgring-Nordschleife or Indianapolis, the Monaco GP course remains unparalleled.
But I doubt whether this will be enough to stop the loss of membership of the Catholic Church in the long term - all the more so since many bishops and cardinals in Brazil and other Latin American countries oppose the new course.
Only those who successfully complete a three-day course in the company's own training academy, in which they learn the correct handling and application of Semco, are allowed to sell this building material later on.
In recent months, the Fed has become uncertain about its previously announced intentions - the so-called "forward-looking guideline" - for the future course of monetary policy.

This assumption is also underlined by the various prizes and recognitions Poken has received in the last two years, most recently at the end of June 2010 the coveted label "CTI Certified" of the Swiss Confoederation "s Innovation Promotion Agency CTI.
"This prize is awarded within the framework of the Swiss Innovation Forum and is awarded to companies that provide outstanding innovative and technological services and have an above-average market potential," explains jury member Hans Baumgartner, Head of Credit Suisse's SME Business.

The prizes, in addition to the publications, represent the quality of the research that is carried out.
What do prices mean to you?
One is happy about any price.
I am aware that good luck is involved and that you also have to accept the prices with a bit of humility - you usually build on the preparatory work of others.

After consultation with the Credit Suisse Foundation, which is not represented in the jury, it was decided to award the prize equally to Laura Schmid and Pablo Barragán Hernández.
The Romand himself could hardly capture his second prize, the Best Album Pop / Rock National:

The prize is intended to honour outstanding achievements.
In addition to the amount of money, the prize consists of an appearance with the Vienna Philharmonic at the Lucerne Festival.
However, I do not believe that such prizes are groundbreaking for one's own artistic development.
Without these prizes, I would hardly have developed differently artistically, aesthetically.
For me, a prize means first and foremost a great recognition, as one otherwise gets only for important publications in research - with the difference that such an award, unlike a publication in professional circles, shows that one's own work is also perceived and appreciated by people who do not belong to one's field of expertise.

There was a danger, however, that he would suffer physical and psychological harm because he was trapped in a narrow space and could not perform physical exercises outdoors.
They make significant personal sacrifices and sometimes take great risks to their own physical safety and mental health.
The members of the Security Council expressed their appreciation to the ECOWAS countries for the enormous sacrifices they have made and for their contribution to the cause of peace and stability in Sierra Leone and urged ECOWAS members to continue supporting peacekeeping efforts in Sierra Leone.
Their sacrifice will not be in vain.
This time we discussed with director Alena (not a single man takes part in the course) how to attract a woman who does not have an ideally proportioned figure.
The course will be developed and offered by interested governments, international organizations and institutions with the necessary expertise and facilities.
As the example of the peacekeeping forces that have recently returned to Haiti teaches us, the United Nations must stay on course if the fragile peace that prevails at the start of a peacekeeping mission is to be consolidated and made irreversible.
This Action Plan builds on the progress made in the field of human rights over the past 60 years and sets a course to strengthen the OHCHR so that it can meet the imperative requirements of human rights in today's world.
Even where the course to be followed is clear, nothing will happen if there are significant shortages of capacity - in other words, if there is a shortage of human, financial or other resources.
It encourages the new government to pursue the course of stability and national reconciliation and to promote social harmony.
Bearing in mind the experiences in Haiti, the Central African Republic, Guinea-Bissau and Timor-Leste, I urge Member States not to stop prematurely on the path to peace and UN peacekeeping.
The Security Council therefore praises the course followed by the democratically elected Government of Lebanon and the Lebanese armed forces in exercising their respective responsibilities in the period leading up to the presidential elections.
Trump's great achievement?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have also divided small-scale families.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the US offering advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-choosing relatives.
We are all supposedly trying to make our filter bubbles burst.
Less noticed has been the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long worked with the Republicans in our family, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship she had fought with for decades because of politics, is suddenly and oddly on the same page.
With regard to the dining table, this is certainly a good thing, but it strikes me in a wider context that this also entails considerable risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the strength to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that his kittens will one day no longer repel us.
There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness when compared to his standards.
I find myself today afflicted by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, in fact, come across as very mild offenses.
If Trump goes, the next Republican candidate only needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels in the New York parking department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are crisp and the animals twist to look over their own shoulders full of fear - extremely sinister and the climbing music conveys this in a strange way.
Disappoint so many clichés of a city: The views of tall buildings are getting old, the skylines are becoming too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city doesn't do justice to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big roundabout in north London.
The Central Park carousel, however, is still a strangely magical experience, as here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40's can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily nobody asked for it.
On the other hand, in a department store this week, I was forced to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pull through my credit card.
In the coffee house on the corner of my street it's the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.
This not only leads to a slowdown in what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the department store stood apologetically grinning while I tired of the experience of handing her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius with chest pain moved from prison to hospital
Pistorius has left prison for the second time for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to hospital for treatment of cuts to his wrists, which, according to prison authorities, he suffered after a fall in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors against an initial manslaughter sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cubicle at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nightly intruder hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against Pistorius' six-year prison sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Law Enforcement Agency said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk of his sentence being increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he subjugated women's contacts to the outside world.
The world price of crude oil rose by 52 percent this year - last month the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly $100.
In the Budapest trade triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has also increased by 16 percent this year, however, price increases of over 1,000 HUF have been registered in all hypermarkets.
After prices in food markets were "davongaloped" last December, inflation has not been drastic in percentage terms, compared to the already high, earlier baseline level.
Prices for Unicum and live fish remained close to the previous year's level, while prices for turkey bruise fillets, nut and poppies rose sharply.
Prices for flour and bread were in line with those of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but Auchan had 1kg of bread for 139 forints.
Also surprising here was the price of a two litre Coca-Cola deposit bottle of less than 200 forints, so the drink including deposit cost only 257 HUF.
Our calculations have shown that Cora's prices in the "Napi" shopping cart have increased by 15 compared to Christmas prices last year, while Tesco and Auchan have each increased by 18 per cent.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, there has been a catastrophic price increase, and the price of daily consumer goods in hypermarkets has risen by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at the prices at all.
The price of this car is not exactly popular.
It still seems uncertain to what extent we can actually act on the stock exchange, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at the customer level.
Insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that higher risks of accidents also result in higher premiums.
The cautious drivers can choose a full-length casco with a deductible, so that the benefits of a full-body insurance are covered, but offered at a low price.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
This subsequently led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, which drastically pushed up prices.
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
Prices rose overall by 3.0 percent year-on-year.

Articles 1.2 (j), (k) and (l) of the Staff Regulations lay down the basic rules governing the issue of accepting honorary signs, orders, perks, gifts or contributions from bodies outside the organisation (see 2001 Code of Conduct, paragraphs 46 and 47).
The old Article 1.6 regulated this issue in a provision in which the acceptance of any advantage by a government was prohibited and the acceptance of benefits by non-governmental bodies was severely restricted.
With its proposed wording of Article 1.2 (j), the Secretary-General wanted to express his view that the General Assembly should emphasize the importance of the impression of the strict independence and impartiality of the staff and thus reaffirm the absolute prohibition of the acceptance of benefits by governments.
The Secretary-General will inform all Member States in writing of this principle of the Organisation in relation to the acceptance of badges, orders, benefits, gifts or benefits, in order to avoid such incidents as far as possible.
This consent is granted only in exceptional cases and only if the acceptance is not incompatible with the interests of the organisation and with the position of the employee as an international official.
In accepting such gifts, there should be little risk of undermining the integrity or independence of staff.
Under Article 101.2 (m) of the Staff Regulations, the Secretary-General may exceptionally authorise an employee to receive honorary marks, orders, benefits, gifts or benefits not covered by Article 101.2 (j) to (l), provided that their adoption is in the interests of the United Nations and is incompatible with the position of the employee.
Order of business, adoption of the agenda and allocation of agenda items: Reports of the Presidential Committee (Rule 21)
I welcomed the resumption of inspections by the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) in Iraq in November 2002, following the unanimous adoption of Security Council Resolution 1441 (2002).
As farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
The fourth-graders were the last of the Blumberg schools to be released on holiday and to secondary schools.
Three of the students will go to high school, four to secondary school.
School principal Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of dismissal, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle, which grows up in the chicken yard but is then released to freedom.
To this the cheerful band performed a musical titled "The eagle in the chicken farm."
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and had it incubated by his chickens.
Instead of a chicken pie, a little eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken out of him was dashed, and the eagle spread out its wings on a high mountain and disappeared.
After that, classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young gockles that cylinders wore to make the bet.
The eagle stood for integration, said school principal Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other young animals (chicks), but belongs to them.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His purpose was to be free.
She wished every fourth-grader that he felt accepted in his new school.
This was followed by a word of thanks to the colleagues, the former headmaster Michael Müller, who repeatedly jumps into teaching difficulties, and the parents' representatives.
The kissing season is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She is very reluctant to release her students after two years of teaching, because it was a really great time.
In the end, she was able to rely on the fourth-graders.
At the end, all students performed a song of summer time and holiday time.
Great joy broke out among the children.
Eight first graders have already been registered for the new school year.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television, reported.
On the morning of August 1, a group of people illegally camping in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians, was arrested by the police.
On the same day they were released while an investigation is currently ongoing.
The Foreign Ministry told bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and are imposing substantial fines on anyone found to stay in a place not intended for this purpose.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said that the court may impose a fine.
First, because some young people do not take advantage of these cheap cards anyway, as they would not listen to classical music at any price.
Yet the Bavarians, undefeated in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collapsed on Mecca's Grand Mosque.
The victim suffered a nasal fracture and was bleeding heavily from the nose.
When his two friends rushed and appeasingly spoke to the thug, he first let go of his victim.
A 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate, who has been missing since Saturday, has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The last victim of this stinginess was a just beginning affair that had been more promising for alleviating the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and might even have brought him some satisfaction.
We have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now a part of my past.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus, with more than 600 victims of the fever.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What those affected need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to take part in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars in the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.
Euro 4 diesel or worse are exempt.
Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europa gives his opinion:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have cheating software," says Anja Smetanin.
The Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) has ordered their retrofitting.
How and from when will customers be informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a swift implementation in the next few months, but have not yet given an exact date.
Daimler has indicated that it will write to each person concerned.
If an inspection is due anyway, it will be done within its framework.
How long will the overall changeover take?
"It's hard to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as the political pressure.
"Because we have seen that car manufacturers are not yet acting voluntarily on the subject of the environment."
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It might be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do motorists who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
Presumably foreign manufacturers would follow suit, according to Smetanin.
Is there now a risk of a massive drop in the price of Euro 4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
But precisely in those regions where driving bans are threatened.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesels so far.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale yet.
Despite advances in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of contracting it.
In particular, by resorting to a hurried vote, the Egyptian people are given an ultimatum: "Either you vote for my draft or I keep unlimited power," the latter should supposedly end after the adoption of the Constitution.
Petrizki also lived with him in the camp.
Every few hours they took a bath, so it was high afternoon when they returned to the camp.
Everything in the camp was drenched, the fire extinguished; for they were careless drivers, like all their peers, and had not taken precautions against the rain.
All means of getting hot and tired were applied scrupulously, and gradually all the emigrants flocked back to the camp, equipped with plentiful hunger, and then the destruction of the good things began.
Ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
The Kennedy Awards gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first awards ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the prize winners doesn't want to come - in protest.
Ll Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the prestigious Kennedy Center's coveted awards.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year's honorees include singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), as well as choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95).
The awards will be presented in early December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will hold a reception and attend the ceremony along with his wife Melania.
For this reason, the award-winner Lear, who has become famous with progressive TV series, has already announced that he will refrain from attending the gala.
To the New York Times, he said: "This presidency has chosen to completely neglect the arts and human rights - to deprive them of even the means - and that weighs on me."
The 59-year-old Estefan insisted she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her view.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the US capital.
Previous winners of the award include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
Our politicians don't understand enough about science, and they rarely seek the advice of scientists and engineers when it comes to solving important problems.
Larger US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have close ties with the Iraqi oil ministry and have been on hand with technical advice in recent years, have gone blank.
This year, she is a candidate for Chile's National Literature Prize, an award given by the government, the Ministry of Education and the National Council for Arts and Culture.
He is one of 16,000 Egyptians convicted by military courts since the Higher Council of the Armed Forces became the de facto ruler of Egypt.
For a year now, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), the Egyptian Military Council, has been abominably abusing Egyptian women in a way that is not irreparable, sexually, physically and mentally.
The government was forced to set up a council to write a new constitution: A group of citizens - without politicians, lawyers or university professors - who made the discussion process accessible to all and managed to draft a preliminary proposal by consensus.
In any case, we can already begin the analysis of the candidate list, draw some conclusions about it and also make forecasts as to who will get a seat in the Council.
At the moment there are 142 registered candidates for the 45 seats in the Council.
Although there has always been a gender imbalance in the protest movement, the list of candidates for the Council reaches a new level of imbalance.
While some opponents criticized the voting process and the results, many (if not most) members of the protest movement hailed the council as a triumph of cooperation and mobilization.
In the near and distant future, the Council will certainly still frequently take a position on similarly sensitive issues.
Both Ethiopia and the Council have good constitutions.
Based on the assumption that social stability and peace are conducive to economic activity, the Pact held a series of dialogues in 2001 on the role of companies in zones of armed conflict in order to find out how companies within their sphere of influence can enhance people's security.
Affirming that any acceptance of the unlimited possession of nuclear weapons by nuclear states is incompatible with the integrity and sustainability of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and with the broader objective of maintaining international peace and security,
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city builder, is retiring in the coming year.
The position has already been advertised, but suitable candidates are rare.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And the work is still great fun for him, as he conveys in the press conference.
He reports on varied but also demanding tasks awaiting his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application has met the requirements profile so far.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest opportunity.
Thus - while respecting the regular notice periods - there should still be enough time for an induction.
As Haslach acts as a sub-contracting authority for the administrative community, the applicant has to present the corresponding accounts.
Because the city wants to keep this function in any case.
If they were no longer able to fill them, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But proximity to the city and to the city itself is important, says Wacker, who reports a good working atmosphere as well as good mood between the authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, a number of important projects have accumulated, which Wacker looks back on with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure about the building office and its employees.
But a variety of projects will also be on the agenda in the future: The transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz, for example, have been initiated.
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renovated, and the refurbishment of the stadium is still an issue.
The latter alone will cost around 1.5 million euros, "if we get it right," estimates Wacker.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
Working here is fun. "
There is a lot of room for manoeuvre for a city builder.
With Haslach's own farm and nursery can be reacted to many things quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town is listed as an ensemble, it is important to "keep an eye on what fits in" when new buildings are approved, emphasizes the outgoing city builder.
In any case, the city builder bears a great deal of responsibility.
He is a builder, "in the end everything here runs over my table."
He can count on long-term employees for support and coordination: Markus Neumaier (building) has been involved for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) for 15 years.
Wacker also hopes that his successor will stay for a long time: "We are looking for someone who really identifies with the position and wants to stay."

Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in Britain, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.
The senior researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not enter the body.
Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease can result from it.
In experiments, it has been found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their bowels.
And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: 'We have established a link between a species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. '
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory intestines, when the same system also works in humans.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which had been housed separately, did not have this.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the mice's gut microbiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mice's intestines were DNA sequenced and six species of bacteria were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells but were missing in the mice without them.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment so they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells originated.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers let L. reuteri grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into the cells that promote tolerance.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as idol-3 lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophantic levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the gut.
Potentially, high tryptopical levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have committed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United have signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Chelsea's £40 million signing began with a 2-1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup begins against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the keeper role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched forward at will.
Matic, however, had been ruled out of the Blues' preparatory Asia tour and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he needed to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
'we'll help him be ready sooner than later. '
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also starred at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho shaped his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted the club had already done a "fantastic job" of fulfilling three of its four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, for that I thank the club," he added.
'i'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've gone to great lengths. '

New blow for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still head of the SPD, social-democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before the elections.
Just not a barrage from the party headquarters, just no headwind from the federal government - that was the main wish of the campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has fundamentally changed.
Since then, the employees of the Willy-Brandt-Haus have watched with growing horror the events in the SPD-governed state capitals.
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described with headwinds.
They were lows.
One after the other.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-green simply cannot govern reliably," CDU General Secretary Peter Tauber told the Editorial Network Germany (RND).
The surprise resignation of a Green MEP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and the FDP.
Greens chief executive Michael Kellner has called on breakaway Lower Saxony Greens MP Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The move to the CDU is a clear distortion of the will of the electorate.
Elke Twesten must immediately give back her mandate, "the Green Party's federal chief executive and campaign manager told the Editorial Network Germany (RND).
"All this must not be true," sighs one SPD campaigner as the new obscure message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, left the CDU without a majority of his own government after the green MEP Elke Twesten came to power.
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state federations.
And no one knows what's next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, nothing more, the comrades calmed down.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
That's what it got - and it got much worse.

The comrades painstakingly rose up again in the weeks afterwards.
Then, when they had just plucked up new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next low blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD national chief, lost his Nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned.
And because in the crisis communication after that he did pretty much everything wrong that you can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now also Stephan Weil.
Because of the Volkswagen exhaust gas affair and its role on the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been under criticism for a long time.
Miese survey values were added.
In spite of this, or perhaps because of it, Weil tried to focus more and more on the federal government in the past weeks.
The desire of the former mayor of Hanover to extend his power in Berlin was also not hidden from comrades in the vicinity of Martin Schulz.
They let him go, because they promised Weil a stabilization of the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
Weil is not really to blame for the intra-party quarrel of the Lower Saxony Greens.
And Schulz certainly not.
For the time being, the comrades therefore try to keep their own ranks closed.
Her anger is directed at the Greens, and here especially at the breakaway parliamentarian twesten.
"It is intolerable and anti-democratic how Ms Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party leftists in the SPD parliamentary group, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten was elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but through the Land list of the Lower Saxony Greens, the Lower Saxony Member continued.
The logical consequence would be for it to give back its mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary group, laments an "undemocratic manoeuvre."
"The will to vote four years ago was clear: The people made Stephan Weil prime minister," Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate in the federal election, tells the RND.
"Now the personal career giving of a future CDU MP is distorting the election result," Oppermann further said.
He called for the backgrounds to be clarified.
I want to know whether there has been more or whether there have been more far-reaching commitments from the CDU in Lower Saxony.

So either a single amendment replaces everything - and that has been the procedure up to now - or else there will be a single vote on each paragraph.
However, it will amend this paragraph to make it clear that the fares must cover the direct operating costs of the airline on the route in question and that any State aid granted under Article 93 of the Treaty can be deducted from the costs of the airline.
I would ask the Commissioner to confirm to us that the Commission intends to carry out the investigation mentioned in the second paragraph.
I would therefore ask everyone here to pay attention to the last paragraph of this motion for a resolution, in which we recommend a joint study to be carried out, particularly by the Committee on Agriculture and Development, of all the new aspects arising in the sugar sector from the introduction of new techniques and products.
The last paragraph of Article 3 merely refers to the right of initiative conferred on the Commission by the Treaties.
There is a paragraph in this agreement which says that the Council of Ministers should reach an agreement to plug the 1984 and 1985 budget gap.
As regards respect for human rights in the Community, the Council recalls that, when ratifying the Treaties establishing the European Communities, the Member States approved the following paragraph of the preamble:
It attaches far too much importance to a subcommittee of the Senate, which in fact has no power, and does not go into the subject sufficiently in the other paragraph.
The French version lacked the expression 'from the European Parliament', which means that the paragraph, which has been discussed at great length in the Committee on Development and Cooperation, loses all meaning.
A paragraph in the resolution tabled by Mr Herman and his party colleagues, on the other hand, calls for a remark on our part: We are surprised that the Commission's proposals are perceived as being geared only to the short term.
We voted on the first paragraph of Rule 102 (a) but, as far as I remember, we did not actually vote on the second paragraph.
It is clear that the House has adopted the first paragraph.
Then this paragraph was voted out by a committee majority.
An amendment which I tabled and which was adopted by the majority of the House is recorded in the Minutes as being rejected, and finally the recital of the original resolution has been miraculously transformed into a first paragraph of the main part.
In paragraph III, last paragraph, concerning the Committee on Budgets, the German text again contains the wrong translation.
This paragraph forgets that the Baltic countries are currently part of the Soviet Federation, that their authorities and their peoples know this well, just as they also know that the rhythm of reforms depends on that of democratisation in the USSR.
I refer here to Article 14, second paragraph.
However, when we analyse this article, we see that, according to its first paragraph, the Member States are endeavouring to promote the improvement of the working environment in particular.
Due to a misunderstanding, 16 members of my group voted against this paragraph and two abstained.
It is clear to me, however, that this would have had no effect on the final result, since the paragraph was rejected by a majority of 55 votes.
Can the Commission say whether, in accordance with the paragraph of Recommendation 85 / 308 / EEC (x) on the social protection of voluntary aid workers, it has submitted a report on the progress made in ensuring social protection?
You are no doubt aware that the first paragraph of Article 146 of the EEC Treaty, as it stands today, reads: 'The Council is made up of representatives of the Member States.
Firstly, will the Commission accept this amendment, which is to remove the second paragraph of Article 6?
Because, Mr President, in every paragraph she mentions the issues of the Kurdish question, the Cyprus problem, torture, freedom of the press and trade union freedoms in Turkey, and this means that there are problems.
Secondly, it is true that the first paragraph of Article J4 of the Maastricht Treaty reads: 'The common foreign and security policy covers all matters relating to the security of the European Union, including, in the longer term, the definition of a common defence policy which could lead to a common defence in due course'.
That is why I now hope that the Commissioner will consult with his colleagues over Christmas and ask them to pre-empt my paragraph in the resolution in the new year.
It started well this week in the European Parliament because we discussed, among other things, the Barzanti report, in which the following paragraph summarises the opinion of many Members of Parliament.
That was in the paragraph.
However, if we look at Part II of the Protocol, we see that point 1 is in fact a decision consisting of three recitals and a reasoned paragraph.
Funding for the town centre III
Those who want to rehabilitate their old house will soon be able to get support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Urban Development informed about this in Empfingen on Wednesday.
At the beginning of the briefing, Schindler gave a review of what had happened so far.
There have been refurbishment areas in Empfingen since 1991.
At that time, in the refurbishment area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding.
In the refurbishment area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still at 60 percent.
For Schindler, the refurbishments so far are a "success project" - after all, it is important to promote internal development as well, and not only to develop new building areas.
On 4 April the head of the Karlsruhe government was informed that there would be a refurbishment area III.
The funding amounts to EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 would come from the Land, the rest from the municipality of Empfingen.
How is a refurbishment area created?
According to Schindler, one will investigate where the "really old" houses are.
It also played a role, however, whether there was any interest at all in the planned area to be remedied.
If necessary, the territorial limits could then shift again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-state program "Social City," in the framework of which the refurbishments would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on an objective basis, that is, per plot of land.
The refurbishment area would then be set as a statute.
The grant period runs from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
Until September of this year, however, the inventory would be carried out, during which the participants in the remediation area would receive a questionnaire to fill in.
As far as possible, the statutes should be adopted in November or December, so that the renovations can begin next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the said preliminary examinations.
It was a matter of evaluating the problems of urban planning and deciding when to rehabilitate and to what extent.
A refurbishment note would then be entered in the land register for the respective plot of land.
She promised that Pietzschmann would come back to her senses and get an idea of the situation herself.
Gotzel emphasized that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants.
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land questionnaire," which deals, among other things, with the building condition and the renovation plans.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and housing form," information on the size, distribution and inhabitants of a living room can be provided.
The blue "operating arc" can only be filled in if business premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted, Gotzel pointed out, that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also emphasized that the distribution of funds works according to the "first come, first served" principle.
It is not possible to "reserve" any funds for later.
At the end, photos of the project "Location II" were shown, in order to make a restoration "tasty."
British inventor sets himself a microchip to get into the house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be fitted with a microchip so he can open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with a movement of his hand.
Steven Northam, 33, had the tiny chip implanted between his thumb and forefinger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives using technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure the implant procedure is performed to medical standard.
The technology resembles a cats and dogs implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for an extra £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now fitted both at home and in his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is at the wheel.

White House advertising costs cost the taxpayer thousands
The White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month cost taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military's figures, which were left to TIME magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of the event on July 17 at the White House with American building programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials took a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, made in Connecticut, was issued next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi.
The White House military office requested the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order, or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to records from the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," the commander of HMX-1 wrote on the eve of the event to his supervisor, the deputy naval commander for aviation.
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m. on July 17 at around 7 a.m., and remained until the lawn was cleared between 6: 00 p.m. and 9: 00 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House were to be delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the limitation of service hours.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security staff stayed with the aircraft during the time on the ground.
It was not clear from the records made available to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the provision.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked," the deputy commander replied.
The "Made in America" event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave a push for health care reform, which was underway in the Senate, and he touted efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for the trip.
But to request their use only for a photo operation is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane operated taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of notifications complaining about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessor.
"The White House is excited about the show" Made In America "- which features products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials," said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews frequently carry out training flights in the Washington area and the South Lawn to oust the US president at the White House with precise centimetre rates.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 carried out 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted in the flight crew's training needs for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said taxpayers did not take over the burden for any of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company had not been involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to US Department of Defense hourly rates for the 2017 fiscal year, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Unit records record the plane's flight time as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below this rate.
"Setting the cost to taxpayers on the basis of estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," Walters said.
'These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds. '
According to a 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include staff costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contracting.
At the time, the former White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, defended the helicopter's use for the event.
"The idea is to present things this week that are made in America," Spicer said.
'and I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to underline that. "
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a firefighter car.
At the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of them."

The Community is called upon to continue and step up its efforts and efforts to ensure the success of this initiative, which is obligatory but which is still laudable.

It is for this very reason, Mr President, that this Parliament has distinguished itself - and continues to do so - by its constant efforts in this area and urges the Commission and the Member States to ensure that the commitments made in Hamilton are confirmed at the next G7 meeting.
All this exceeds the corresponding efforts on the European side many times over.
Our commitment and commitment remains unchanged.
We owe our full commitment to our constituents and to the European idea.

How America can harm OMV
Donald Trump was not really happy when he signed the law to tighten sanctions against Russia Wednesday evening.
"In its haste to enact the law," Congress wrapped up a few "unconstitutional regulations," he etched.
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels bragged about the US push.
After all, the draft provides for punishing European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Since then, investors in the domestic OMV, which, together with other European companies, is co-financing the construction of the Russian Baltic pipeline, Nord Stream 2, have been worried.
The threat is enormous.
Nevertheless, it was too early to assess the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil company.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would still have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons are his choice.

Narcos season 3 trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be the focal point in Netflix's hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos, which revealed Pablo Escobars Killer, the Netflix series is far from over.
Season three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first of which received its first trailer and featured the show's latest villains.
With the third season, the DEA has turned its attention to the richest drug trafficking organisation in the world: The Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful sponsors, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican compound, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.

Roll back: The city hires 46 kitchen assistants
The city organizes the Kita lunch table itself again.
With fixed contact for the children and an assignment to the team.
In the municipal day care centers, the clock is turned back.
On September 1, the city of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the municipal children's day care facilities (Kitas) on its own.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of Youth Aid, this is good news: "We were all very pleased."
Cooking continues to be done away from home: A caterer takes on this task and delivers freshly cooked chilled biscuits.
The city operates 46 day care centres in the Krefeld area, and in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunchtime.
In the past year of kittens, 2800 children each sat at the tables, and demand is growing steadily.
"In the meantime, not only children who are cared for 45 hours per week are eating lunch at the Kita," explains Pomeranz.
"The offer is also valid in the 35-hour care if children stay until 2 p.m."
Forty-six part-time workers will have kitchen service from 1 September: They will warm up the delivered meals, complement them with salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, eat out, clean and rinse the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a kita," says Pomeranz.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - determines the amount of hours.
"The kitchen helpers are now firmly part of the Kita team," Pommeranz says with satisfaction.
"This means that they are much more involved and it is easier to implement pedagogical concepts for kittens."
Because that is also what it is all about: Healthy nutrition and cooking lessons.
"The children should help to prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
Also for the children.
'They have a known force in the kita, a person familiar to them, and not constantly changing people. '
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - up to now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical in the cost comparison between self-regulation and outsourcing for the city, says the press office.
This is despite the fact that 46 part-time workers are being recruited.
"But these hours don't matter so much for around 750 people in the education sector," says Sonja Pommeranz.
In addition, like many other project critics, he fears that traffic would increase sharply due to the planned size of the plant: "Entire bus loads have to come here to pay for this," says Schulz

Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, Acting Head of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will stand as candidates in provincial council elections. Three women stand for the role of Vice-President and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will take place on April 5.
The Taliban have released threats against an election process that coincide with the transition from international combat to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will hand over power peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will further reinforce Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women out of a total registered 3.6 million voters were registered.
When two months ago the Prime Minister evaded the call for an election, shamefully insulting the intelligence of the British by claiming that opinion polls had not influenced that decision, there was hope that he would provide a robust, efficient government.

GMB concerns over investment in McVitie factory in Glasgow
A union would like to reassure managers of biscuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company had remained silent about the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he had invested more than £5 million in recent years.
He added that employees and union representatives would be "the first to learn" if their activities were to change.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland urged McVitie's to "raise concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be advanced."
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the general site manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross profoundly affects our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is strongly focused on the local community and Greater Glasgow, an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social deprivation.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic fall in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie. "
A Pladis spokeswoman said: "The branch manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the ongoing engagement with staff and union representatives.
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some issues were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that we, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise Tollcross's heritage as a manufacturing facility. If our operations at the site change, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to learn about this. "
"My uncle Reed is in heaven and can see everything you do and say; and my father and my mother too; they know that you lock me up all day and that you only wish I was dead."
Only two or three days ago I buried a small child of five years - a good child whose soul is now in heaven.
"Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works and praise your Father who is in heaven." Ev.
And then my soul made the first serious effort to comprehend what had been put into it in relation to heaven and hell; for the first time I looked around me and saw in front of me, next to me, behind me nothing but an immeasurable abyss; for the first time my soul trembled, it felt a point,
"So you are sure, Helen, that there is something called heaven; and that our souls will go there when we die?"
› Put it on the fourth finger of my left hand and I belong to you and you belong to me; and we will leave this earth and seek our heaven over there. "
She was near, and since I had not sent any request to heaven to turn her away from me - since I had not folded my hands, bent my knee, or moved my lips - then she came: In great heavy waves the current was blowing over me.
I could defeat the housing, but the occupant would fly to the sky before I could call myself the owner of that shell of earthly clay.
Without a doubt, St. John would have given the world to follow her, to call her back, to hold her back if she left him like that; but he did not want to give up an atom of his expectation of heaven; he did not want to give her love a single hope of true, eternal paradise.
But then she picked up her old lament: "Oh, why did heaven want it this way?
He regretted him, but then he declared that in a certain respect the sick man had to rejoice, for it was the Lord's will that gave him the opportunity to reconcile with heaven.
Her hands folded, she lifted her head and looked up to the sky.
Thanks to Heaven, he had survived this journey happily and arrived in Rome without an accident.

Look, for a sign coming from heaven - for there is the sun - these thousand churches tremble at once.
This young, paternal and mutterless brother, this little child, who suddenly fell into his arms from heaven, made a new man out of him.
At the points where these currents cut themselves in the sky, they create the light; at their cutting point on earth, they bring out the gold...
The creature that stood before my eyes possessed that superhuman beauty, which can only come from heaven or hell.
She raised her roasted and dry eyes to the sky, to the sun, to the silver clouds, which were shattered here and there by deep blue triangles and trapezes; then she slammed them down, looked around her, to the ground, to the crowd, to the houses...
It is a death worthy of the wise man who has wavered throughout his life: A death that is not flesh and not fish, like the spirit of the true sceptic, a death that expresses wholly the doubt and indecision that keeps the middle between heaven and earth, which keeps one in limbo.
The beggars shouted, gasped, cursed and ascended; and Quasimodo, who felt powerless against so many enemies, trembled for the gypsy and saw the angry faces approaching more and more of his gallery, asked heaven for a miracle and full of despair.
You will find it in heaven. "
As for Quasimodo, who had not stopped fighting for a moment, when he saw this wild escape, he fell on both knees and raised his hands to the sky; then he stormed away, drowned with joy, and rose with the speed of a bird to that cell, so frightened of its entrances.
Sometimes he looked with bewildered eyes at a kind of narrow plate, which was formed about ten feet deeper by the bumps of the string arteries, and he asked heaven, in the bottom of his distressed heart, that it should be possible for him to decide his life on this space of two feet in the fourth year.
We pondered together about such works as "Ververt et Chartreuse" by Grasset, "Belphegor" by Macchiavelli, "Heaven and Hell" by Swedenborg, "The underground journey of Nicolaus Klimm" by Holberg, the Chiromantie by Robert Flud'Sonne and the City of France. "
In Him alone we find peace and comfort and salvation and love, "she said, and began to turn her eyes to heaven, praying as Alexei Alexandrovitch concluded from her silence.
He knew none of these except Enoch, who was taken up alive into heaven.
Shortly before, he had known all the names; but now he had completely forgotten them, especially because Enoch was his favorite figure from all over the Old Testament and in his head attached to the rapture of the living Enoch in the sky a whole long series of thoughts, which he relied on even half his father's eyes.
The agonizing state of waiting that she went through, as it were, floating between heaven and earth, in Moscow, Alexey Alexandrovitch's slowness and indecision, her isolation, she charged him with everything.
A heavy thunderclap came down rolling and upholstery from the sky and lost itself in the distance in a dull groove.
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar three years ago?
The La Liga side may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after making an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the world record robbery?
The sensational approach has fuelled the transfer window in the summer as the Ligue 1 club is poised to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for £89 million last season.
After the termination, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than £500,000 per week.
Barcelona are furious at the way Neymar forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalans board insists the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect by the PSG president three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club that wanted to have one of PSG's best players sign.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
'we respect all clubs.
But if they try to have one of our players sign with them, this will have consequences. "
Barcelona appear to have crossed that line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti at the start of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the international from Italy to depart under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of that interest by losing one of their price deals to Neymar.

This shows, Madam President, that the henchman regime, which is supported in the Grande by the military, is taking a hard line against dissenters, for which we, all 12 states of the European Union, share responsibility, because although Parliament has repeatedly sounded the alarm, not only human rights are violated, but also basic democratic principles.
I fully support the line taken by my colleague that codecision with Parliament under Article 129d is necessary for both proposals.
The cumbersome tanker Europe with 12 captains - one thicker, the other narrower - is not making progress, and it has no clear course.
As the work of the Council has not yet been completed, it is not in a position at this stage to comment on the course it intends to follow in this matter.
Now the President can follow the course he has taken and, as I understand it, lead his team in the search for a middle ground.
I would just like to say briefly that this morning, at my suggestion, the Commission adopted an interesting communication on this subject, which, on the one hand, of course maintains the budgetary stance, but at the same time identifies a number of new opportunities which Europe should draw upon.
Germany has spared no efforts or sacrifices in order to achieve this goal, and you will understand, Mr President, that I include in my recognition Chancellor Kohl, who has maintained this course with both courage and determination.
Therefore, although this report is addressed to all the European institutions, it is above all justified as an internal discussion paper of our Parliament, because it is intended to set the most democratic course for our parliamentary route during 1999.
We are setting the Union on a new course of transparency and democracy in a citizens' Europe.
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburger SV becomes the leader of the standings.
"We need the second goal," Hermann Rieger hissed in the cabin of the Hamburg Arena.
His command will have been similar: Here with gate two!
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive goal in the ninetieth minute of the game.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a goal, Plekanec delivered two assists and Kovalev transformed a pass in that victory game, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparation games.
Kovalev scored the victory by shooting the only goal of the whole shootout.
People, animals and goods were safely housed in the Herbergshöfen - the gates were tightly closed for the night, the guards also ensured internal security and peace among the hostel guests.
For in the seventh month of the moon, so many Chinese believe, the gates of the underworld and heaven are wide open and the countless souls of the deceased make their journey back to Earth.
The CO2-neutral energy generated there will first be used for the construction of the city, which is expected to open its doors as early as the end of 2009.
If these banks were to close their doors abruptly, the Swiss economy would be in trouble.
Despite these limitations, the fact that the continent now counts 19 stock exchanges suggests that Africa has opened its doors to foreign investors and companies and is gradually integrating into the global economy.
Contestants from 26 nations took part in the competition, in which the aim was to build the Brandenburg Gate and to dress it up with plates (tiles) - "to tiles," as Liebenauer says.
But this can also open the door to criticism.
Positions at General Motors Overseas Corporation with responsibility for European sales, marketing, planning and commercial relations.
Background: The concept of tariff preferences is based on the recognition that it is particularly difficult for countries whose industry is still under construction, i.e. developing countries, to gain a foothold in the markets of industrial states and to increase their sales there.
Such a market structure entails internationalisation, because national oligopolies, with a stable internal market, are looking elsewhere to increase their sales.
Price reductions in case of overshooting of agreed sales figures: In France, automatic price reductions apply for products whose sales significantly exceed the sales figures indicated in the original price calculation request.
Uniform EC standards also give the European automobile industry an important competitive edge over truck manufacturers outside the Community, since 57 countries are now incorporating EC standards into their national legislation, recognizing that they are useful and practicable for their countries too; this is what we urgently need for truck sales and for thousands of new jobs within the Community.
I think it is important to note that all the factories in the European car industry have been selling for record years until the beginning of 1980, and that the advance of Japanese competition was foreseeable for a long time, including by the automobile industry in Europe, which perhaps thought things would continue so favourably without any effort being made.
It will exacerbate intra-European competition, because even the Member States of the Community, which have so far tried to impose restrictions on Japanese competition, will very soon find that European suppliers will seek their way onto the market in these countries in order to secure sales of their cars despite increased Japanese imports.
In view of the increase in milk supplies in the Community during 1982 and the corresponding increase in butter production, the Commission considers that two types of measures are necessary in the short term, partly in order to ensure reasonable sales of butter stocks and partly in order to prevent a renewed overgrowth of the butter mountain.
As you know, the Community has fallen considerably behind in this area over the last ten years, as its paragraph, which was already moderate at the time, shows.
Both the Subcommittee on Technical Barriers to Trade and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs believe that the noise level of household appliances plays a role in sales and that this problem is solved by competition, by market forces themselves, so that there is no need for legislation.
The Community's consumer organisations, like the Socialist Group, have for years tirelessly pointed out that only a move away from sales and price guarantees and a move towards real structural policy can get the car back on track.
With such an action, that country could have artificially increased its sales on the world market in 1985, which would undoubtedly have aggravated the already difficult situation on that market.
I am prepared to consider such an abolition at a time when a level of production is reached that is acceptable for internal use and for sales.
Can the Commission say to what extent the sale of unleaded petrol has replaced the sale of leaded petrol in each of the Member States of the Community?
We should therefore support anything that serves to increase quality and improve marketing and sales.
The European Parliament recently decided to promote market-oriented sales of these products, rather than intervention measures, by improving the quality of supply.
Contrary to the hopes of everyone, but also to the expectations expressed by Norway, sales on the Japanese market did not increase in 1995, and there was even a slight decrease.
On the other hand, the Commission's prudent export policy promotes the sale of Community rice on the internal market.
However, given the different views of the Member States as regards the promotion of sales on the internal market and overall the positions of the Member States on sales or promotion of alcoholic beverages, I believe that we have a problem here which would make it very difficult to enter into a common organisation of the market in wine.
This initiative is all the more timely given that we already have assessments of the campaigns to promote the sale of olive oil and fibre flax - as Mr Fantuzzi also pointed out - whose sales in third countries have increased thanks to the promotion of ad hoc instruments.
In this context, I would like to stress that I consider the efforts made in the Fantuzzi report to increase sales to be positive.
It is necessary for the EU to pursue an active export policy which goes beyond the use of export refunds and which, in addition to the existing export refunds, can have a positive effect on the marketing of agricultural products.
In the Community, the sale of starch and its derivatives is supported by production aid when these products are used in sectors which are not subject to import protection, such as the chemical, pharmaceutical and paper industries.
The concept of tariff preferences is based on the recognition that it is particularly difficult for countries whose industry is still under construction, i.e. developing countries, to increase their sales on the markets of developed countries.
In the Community's view, this system was at least partly responsible for the very sharp decline in Community car exports to Greece in recent times, while suppliers of certain third countries were able to maintain or even increase their sales.
- to facilitate the sale on the world market of the quantities of agricultural products not covered by framework agreements.
(14) The impact on the Community industry concerned, in particular on those companies which produce a large proportion of non-branded standard goods, has been mainly a fall in production, sales and market losses, as well as a significant fall in prices, with significant reductions in net revenues or increasing losses.
- increased sales of raw materials from the ACP countries in the Eastern European countries;
Commissioner CHEYSSCN recalled that the alcohol market in the Community is undergoing a clear downward trend, which naturally affects the sale of rum as well as other spirits on this market.
Their production and sales increased by 2% from 1981 to 1984.
Compare Community data on production and sales of industrial products;
- compare Community data on the production and sale of industrial products; - assess domestic markets; - compare sectors; - know the current situation and plan the future of these industries; - want to be better informed and more competitive.
In recent years, sales of natural gas have broken down as follows:
The paragraph was distributed as follows (estimate 1984):
For its part, sales to households in 1984 were distributed according to the following zones: KWh / year
In 1984, sales on the public network were distributed as follows (preliminary results):
These associations, which are professional bodies governed by civil law, may not distribute any profits (including not in the form of refunds) to their members, joint purchases or joint use of agricultural machinery, as well as the collective supply of their members and the collective sale of their products.
Without neglecting the important aspect of the supply of raw materials, a greater focus on sales and market problems was therefore urgently required.
The increase in sales of motor vehicles in 1994 led to a slight recovery in production in the rubber industry, although production has still not reached its 1992 level in terms of value.
The fact that large companies are weakened or even shut down contributes to the buoyant development of small businesses and their share of sales in France by 10% between 1980 and 1988.
Sales of hard coal coke in the Community have fallen from 45 million tonnes to 40 million tonnes since 1990. The percentage declines during this period ranged between 3% (UK) and 17% (Luxembourg) in each country.
Sales of coal coke in the EU fell by 1.8 million tonnes (4.4%), from 39.7 million tonnes in 1992 to 37.9 million tonnes in 1993.
The beef shortage should have encouraged the sale of poultry meat, the prices of which are relatively low and attractive to the consumer.
A decision under Article 86 required the United Brands Company to impose the following abusive practices on sales of Chiquita bananas within the common market: Closing the market as a result of the prohibition to resell green bananas,
The main measures introduced in 1972 for the sale of the butter and skimmed milk powder surpluses have continued this year, in particular butter has been sold at a reduced price to certain food industries and consumer groups.
However, the continuing poor economic situation in the second half of 1975 resulted in significant losses in sales of coal and coke to thermal power plants and to the iron and steel industry.
The Joint Expert Group, set up after President Jenkins' visit to Tokyo in October 1977, will further examine the conditions of access for Community products to the Japanese market in sectors where sales could be increased.
On the other hand, the paragraph should also be secured.
(I) either the commissions normally paid or agreed for sales in the Community, or the usual surcharges for profit and overhead costs (including the direct and indirect costs of sales) for imported products of the same genre or species;
The Community supports the financing of work which will help to increase production, reduce production prices or facilitate the sale of the products concerned.
(I) either the commissions normally paid or agreed for sales in the Community, or the usual surcharges for profit and overhead costs (including the direct and indirect costs of sales) for imported products of the same genre or species;
Tunisia's industrial sales are heavily concentrated in clothing and, to a lesser extent, in spinning materials (more than 18% of total exports in 1979), partly due to the spectacular increase in "inward processing" followed by investment by companies from Community countries, particularly from the Federal Republic of Germany.
This could even lead, as is already the case with the products of the North, to the Community supplanting exporters through subsidized sales on the world market.
Morocco, in particular, succeeded in redistributing its sales from France and the Federal Republic to the Benelux countries and Scandinavia, and in particular the USSR and Saudi Arabia.
This solution should have the merit of entailing a less open obligation on the part of the Community than a guarantee of revenue or a guarantee / sale on the markets of the Community itself.
Since, in most of these cases, employment is at least as important as balance of payments effects, it would be a better way to guarantee the sale of reduced quantities, but at higher (possibly intra-Community) prices than in the past.
The prohibition of minimum prices does not apply to the sale of books, newspapers and magazines or to goods and services subject to specific legislation which sets minimum or fixed prices.
They represent a decisive framework of sales and development equilibrium for regional production and employment.
In the case of mineral raw materials such as copper, phosphate, iron ore, the ACP countries receive project support when production and sales are at risk and export earnings are reduced as a result.
In terms of sales, the overall concentration in the food production and processing sector is low.
Of course, this programme is not a panacea for European agriculture: On a case-by-case basis, however, it can help to open up new market and income opportunities.
As long as the crisis persists, there is frequent accusations of protectionism on both sides, levelled by lobbies which encounter obstacles in selling their products or who fear that their market will be flooded by products which no longer flow into the normal markets.
Dutch exports, which consist to a large extent (almost 30% in 1983) of raw materials and pre-products, whose sales are particularly responsive to economic developments, could be stimulated in particular by the current stock-building.
This would be a considerable increase in volume, bearing in mind that the forecasts for sales on foreign markets in mid-1983 amounted to 440 billion cubic metres.
Indeed, it is likely that there will be little increase in demand for steel products, which should be reflected in a rather slow increase in total exports, although sales of the new companies will develop dynamically.
While sales of natural gas abroad continued to decline compared to 1986, exports of manufactured goods remained relatively buoyant despite the strong appreciation of the gulf in 1986 and 1987.
As the ministries continued to control the supply of raw materials and prices, and were able to guarantee sales, most management seemed to be more interested in maintaining a good relationship with the apparatus than in demanding their newfound entrepreneurial freedom.
It must also be possible for Parliament to be represented on Europol's management board and to have a say in the election of the director of this body.
Police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because a car met him in his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to dodge and toured the crash barrier.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was travelling with his VW at about 7.55pm on the B 215 from Stolzenau in the direction of Leese.
In the area of the Stolzenau bypass, a car came to meet him on his lane, so that he had to dodge to the right.
In doing so, the Touran driver touted the roadmap.
The car suffered material damage.
The driver of the oncoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without worrying about the traffic accident.
According to the accident victim, it may well be that the Mercedes driver did not even notice the accident.
Police are now asking witnesses to the incident, as well as the driver of the polluter's vehicle, to contact the Commissariat in Stolzenau on tel. 05761 / 92060.
A lack of storage and transport capacity and organisational difficulties mean that the manure has to be "disposed of" in areas with a favourable geographical location.
These bookshops publish EUR-OP in a shop window or part of a shop window reserved for this purpose and must have the main publications of EUR-OP permanently in stock and must also be connected to an online ordering system in order to obtain non-stock titles.
The decline in domestic consumption caused by the economic crisis, a fall in the income of the workforce due to unemployment and high inflation, as well as the fall in exports of Greek wines after accession to the EEC, have led to significant stocks being created, for example, in Crete, Santorini and elsewhere.
In addition to the 1980s harvest, 115 000 tonnes of the 1980s harvest are still in stock today, which could not be sold.
Only one of the speakers mentioned the possibility that his own garden could become a storage area for radioactive waste.
We should be ashamed that we have vast quantities of milk and butter in stock, while in the Third World children are dying of hunger.
He can, of course, also reject them at this stage, but that would only mean postponement, because the day will surely come when the Council is forced to reduce quotas and dissolve the camps.
However, the honourable Member states that 50 000 tonnes of last year's harvest are in stock.
If we continue with our set-aside programme, we will soon have 18 million tonnes in stock.
The Commission pretends that the stocks are too large, which is not true, because less than nine million tonnes of stocks, not even 6% of annual production, is not excessive, but let us leave that aside.
After intervention purchases, we have 200 000 tonnes of butter in stock, not to mention the East German stocks, and by the end of this year these stocks will grow to around 270 000 tonnes.
The war will come to an end, and in the camp of the vanquished, as in the camp of the victors, one will take stock.
There are 40 000 tonnes of salmon in stock, which will soon be thrown onto the world market.
According to press reports, an old cargo ship is operating in the Saronic Gulf, which was converted eight years ago into a floating laboratory and a repository for the oil-containing waste of the passing ships.
The offers must be addressed to the intervention centres, which have good warehouses and resale facilities.
And now we are told that the camps are too expensive.
The majority of my group supports the rapporteur's amendment to the effect that military facilities or camps should be covered by the directive.
The entire camp is divided into different rooms.
It should in principle be possible for Germany, France or England to dump their radioactive waste in a warehouse in Sweden.
The concentration of production capacity allows for maximum economies of scale and leads to the abandonment of intermediate production, storage and handling locations, which leads to conurbation effects in production and distribution areas.
Up to the point of individualization, the number of bearings is kept as low as possible, thus reducing the storage risk, storage costs and transit times.
Concrete applications include: Business people who want to retrieve their fax and e-mail transmissions from outside and without special equipment, sellers who want to check without a terminal whether a given product is in stock, and individuals who want to check their bank account by telephone.
Development of intelligent storage and handling systems to improve product quality.
New developments in the field of biotechnology allow for novel approaches to reduce quality losses and to develop environmentally friendly storage and handling systems.
- on levels 03 and 04, in direct connection with the warehouse and the loading zone (tracts FG.GH.GM and MN): The workrooms for printing and distribution as well as the premises for maintenance services;
This service takes care of removals, storage (including the warehouses in Overijse) as well as insurance and inventory.
This could not be achieved, however, as the negotiating conference was unable to resolve the differences on certain fundamental issues (in particular, the question of the overall size of the camps, their distribution among member countries, the details of developing countries' participation in storage, and the price increases upon which the camp intervenes).
The Council decided to increase the monthly increments for the 1981 / 82 marketing year by around 20% in order to take into account the development of storage and financing costs for cereals storage and the need to reduce stocks of cereals in line with market needs.
This increase, which applies to cereals, flour of wheat and rye as well as to grain and grains of wheat, was granted in accordance with the objectives of the basic Regulation on cereals and bearing in mind the costs of cereal storage in the Community and the need not to cause market disturbances.
Data processing, office tics, procurement, general maintenance, maintenance of equipment, vehicle park, driver, warehouse and archives
The Council took this decision within the scope of the basic Regulation on cereals, in order to take account of the storage and financing costs of cereal storage in the Community and to allow for the sale of stocks of cereals which do not give rise to market disturbances.
Installation of 300 hectares of oil palm trees and 835 hectares of cocoa plantation on the east coast of the island of Neuirland; construction of a palm oil mill and storage and loading facilities; restoration of cocoa processing plants

While the personnel working at the business premises need a lower qualification, those responsible for warehouse management and data technology need a far higher level of education and training.
Changes in inventories can be determined either as a difference between the existing stock at the end and the beginning of the reporting year, or as a difference between the access to the stock during the reporting year and the departures from the stock.
It excludes harbour vessels, lighters and tugboats used in seaports, ferries, fishing vessels, dredging vessels, hydraulic vessels and vessels used exclusively as warehouses, floating workshops, houseboats and for recreational purposes.
Rapid growth in final demand in some Member States has led to a decline in stocks in France (-1.2% of GDP) in the Netherlands (-1.0% of GDP), Denmark (-0.7% of GDP) and Sweden (-0.2% of GDP), with the latter three countries following an upward trend.
There have been repeated sales of olive oil from the Italian intervention site; at the end of 1978 there were still around 95,000 tonnes in stock.
Workshops and warehouses are necessary for mechanical maintenance, boiler work, electrical repairs, etc.
X-Three performs numerous tasks; it manages the warehouse and the distribution centre; its business premises cover 5.4 hectares; it employs more than 640 people, of whom approximately 240 are responsible for managing X-Three.
"Belgian branches, even if there is no representative capable of meeting obligations for the foreign company, are deemed to be the seats of the actual management, branch offices, factories, works, workshops, agencies, shops, offices, laboratories, shopping and sales outlets, as well as all fixed establishments, which produce according to their type."
The Court of First Instance asks, in particular, whether such a transaction exists when the contract of sale between two companies established outside the customs territory of the Community has been concluded, but the purchaser, a subsidiary of the vendor, has a branch established in that area which is responsible for selling the goods to the seller,

As a result, a high degree of elasticity in relation to the share of capital inflows in assets may correspond to a small adjustment of the stock.
Apart from the losses caused by the ongoing storage, processing and transport difficulties, supply will decrease because farmers, who seem to be expecting a further price increase after the increase in state purchase prices in May 1990, are hoarding the grain.
Evidently, the warehouses of pre and intermediate products, which were partially dismantled in the spring, are being somewhat replenished.
The development prospects for production remain positive, even if they deteriorate by one point (+ 5 compared to + 6) and thus reach their July level again, which is undoubtedly linked to the slightly less favourable expectations regarding the size of stocks of unsold finished goods (+ 12 compared to + 11) (Table 2).

Mine demolition will be significant in 1985 (particularly in the UK), but will be almost entirely offset by an increase in storage at UK power stations.
At the end of August 1975, at 960 000 t, the Neunergemeinschaft held almost 1 mill, t (1974 322 000 t) in stock, although in 1974 production fell by 2.4% compared to 1973 and the increase in the first months of 1975 (January to April) did not seem so spectacular at 6.2%.
In recent years it has been possible to develop, distribute and reduce storage and transport equipment for dairy products to such an extent that supra-regional supplies of all dairy products are now practicable.
The requirement of destination is met if all goods stored in a given area are appropriated for security purposes (" space security contract ") or if items to be transferred from the warehouse are individually labelled (" marking contracts ").
However, the market can also be supported by more elastic measures, such as storage or distillation aid, withdrawal by producer groups, and so on.
Interview: "Domspatzen report exonerates Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the cases of abuse exonerates Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.
This is the opinion of author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen continues to provide a basis for discussion.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," after publication to the German Press Agency, said that he expected an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and now Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as from the domicile master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI.
It would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger were to express their deep regret at their own omissions or their mistaken assessment of what was going on at the time.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised the fact that "double standards" were applied in the reporting of violence in the Domspatzen.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that these are "shameful and shameful acts" that must be punished and prevented in the future, but what is striking is the "degree of media manipulation," according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the Italian national bioethics committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to think that this is normal," Scaraffia writes.
In an interview with the Bavarian Radio, Fürstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also commented: "One likes to go to the church and that is a found food."
She also pointed out that in her youth "beatings had been quite a normal pedagogical means" to cope with naughty children, as I was one. "
They would find it unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on the cases of abuse, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared as well.
Absolutely wrong, writes author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the memento "My Brother the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he assesses the results of the final report.
What exactly is written in the 440-page report presented by Ulrich Weber, the lawyer in charge of the Enlightenment in Regensburg?
A total of 547 Regensburg Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of assault, 67 Domspatzen.
The final report refers to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can be said that Domkapellmeister R. used forms of physical and psychological violence in many cases.
Especially with a high degree of emotionality, the punishment for the pupils could also be more severe.
In contrast to many other defendants, however, it is noticeable that many victims appreciated R. "s general humanity and therefore in numerous cases, in spite of violence, even associated positive memories with him."
In an interview, Hesemann explains why, in his opinion, the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger has been relieved.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence against persons in need of protection at the Regensburg Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
For one thing, many students highlight his "humanity."
On the other hand, he also appears as a cholerician and perfectionist, who often became handy when a domed musical did not yield a top performance.
As his biographer, how do you view this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble to read the whole 440-page report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in it at all.
Only eight pages have been devoted to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence at the preschool also occurred outside its sphere of influence.
At best, one can accuse him of being too late to learn of it or of not having taken the first insinuations seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium on which he worked was perceived by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."
Thus, even the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger gives an excellent testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted," "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets from children. "
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to outbreaks of rage.
The fact that he not only knelt with chairs and threw the key dog on the floor, but also distributed earbuds and pulled over-cheeky boys by the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for this.
To his credit, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widely used in the period in question, the 1960s and 1970s, both among parents and teachers.
Do you still know any of these methods?
Of course, I think any of us born before 1968.
I, too, have experienced this in a secular school, a state grammar school.
Compared with what this report is actually about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at preschool, these are, of course, trivial matters.
One wonders if it is not more to do with his notoriety and his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media just rushed at him.
Many of those who have never understood him are still busy working on the Bavarian Pope.
The truth, however, is that the report exonerates Georg Ratzinger in every respect.
In connection with the report, a great deal has been reported in the media on the subject of abuse at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
In the final report, is Georg Ratzinger also accused of any involvement or complicity with regard to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claim to have entrusted themselves to the domain master.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one of those affected on behalf of the others, "It was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem with finding out about sexual abuse was, and still is, that most victims remain silent out of shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not to a choir director, who would have been, in a way, a colleague of the perpetrators professionally.
How do Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger's role with regard to the cases of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: A student in question put it this way: "With regard to sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) of all people would have known in good time and could have stopped the perpetrator in question.
I think it is... also really absurd to assume that of all people... Jacks have opened up more forcefully or clearly or even more often than to their parents, dormitory managers, confidence teachers etc.
That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "
Thus, the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that pupils and / or their environment were entrusted to him beforehand could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation."
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger must therefore be absolved of any complicity.
In this way, he cannot be accused of not having prevented him or brought him to trial.
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these repugnant crimes, as has unfortunately happened in some cases.
There was much to read in the media about "violence" at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
Former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report of "turning a blind eye."
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That's the big problem, that in the reporting everything was mixed up and mixed up into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
That, however, is another abuse of the report.
There is a clear separation: Between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the domains, between sexual abuse and violence and, let us say, other reproaches.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, that is to say also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir director of the Domspatzen.
The whole terrible teaching of beatings, the cases in which boys were harassed and maltreated by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly, all occurred at the nursery school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only got to see the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
On this, as most of the witnesses emphasize, the subject of "preschool" was taboo.
One was only happy to have escaped her and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What was different on the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but there was no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims valued the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases, despite violence, even associate positive memories with him."
So at most there remains the reproach of having looked away.
However, despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which it was told of the conditions at preschool.
The first time in 1970 / 71, when he had just begun to establish himself and wanted to hear nothing of the events at a school where he was not active and responsible (according to the witness), and then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut his ears in front of the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because as early as 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduced.
In it, the Court points out that "caning continues to be carried out in preschool."
Even in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when there was legal clarity, when punishments for beatings had long been banned in Bavaria.
Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as we all know.
For him, too, it was difficult to estimate where those affected might have been exaggerated or dramatised and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he always looked away.
That is simply not true.
Only in 1980 was caning at schools officially abolished in Bavaria.
Fürstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "snare of anachronism," that is, the danger of judging the past according to today's moral standards.
Since the princess is already right.
But this does not, of course, apply to sexual abuse, which has always been abhorrent, nor to what has been committed in the preschool of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond what was then commonplace.
This is all quite horrible and I am glad that it is finally being worked up.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishing, that is to say punching his ear and pulling his hair and ears, were widely used in the 1970s.
When corporal punishment was then forbidden, he strictly adhered to it.
What image of his time in Regensburg did Georg Ratzinger give in his conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Has the issue of caning also been raised?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is to say Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective that the cathedral cats played only a minor role.
Nevertheless, I do not hide the fact that he led a strict regiment there.
But this also has to be said: Without this perfectionism, without demanding absolute discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world-class institution out of the previously rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in 1983 and in Japan (1988).
With biscuits and sweets alone, you don't turn recalcitrant boys into great singers and stand before every success, no matter what field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
As what kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the conversations about her book?
Michael Hesemann: By working on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced him again and again as a wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believing and kind-hearted person, of whom you can't imagine that he could do anything even for a fly.
I regularly get to know how many former Domspatzen still maintain regular contact with him today, 23 years after his retirement, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.
So those who do not forgive him to this day that he was once strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Most of the Domspatzen are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, of course, that may be - but also a lovely person of respect, to whom they still look up today and whom they adore.
And please, once again quite clearly: All you accuse him of are educational methods that were the order of the day at that time.
We can be glad that we have passed this time long ago.
But it is highly unjust to make a man a media scapegoat just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother.
The evil intent behind it is all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves it.
Now decency would dictate to finally leave a 93-year-old man, who has earned himself great merits and without whom no one outside Bavaria and perhaps still Germany would know the Regensburg Domspatzen in peace.
Despite all the difficulties and the lack of resources in carrying out these operations, I am pleased to report that last year we succeeded in significantly reducing the United Nations' commitment to Tajikistan and the Central African Republic.

Some of the jurors have said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, aged 48, and her daughters, Hayley, aged 17, and Michaela, aged 11, would have filled them with disgust.

Orwell's prophecy could have since turned out to be perfectly correct, where you can control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction you make, the visited hotel, the chosen highway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
