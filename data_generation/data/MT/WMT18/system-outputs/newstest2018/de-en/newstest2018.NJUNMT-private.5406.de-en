Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
An irren institution where young people are to meet today.
A mine chapel where the S-Bahn tunnel is now being dug.
Small gardeners manage the former land of farmers.
The oldest official card in Munich promotes exciting stories to day.
It is annoying if maps are not up-to-date.
Everyone who has had to get worked up because the Auto-Navi displayed a green meadow instead of a bypass.
The historical maps of the Bavaria-Atlases digital gallery, an offer of the Bavarian national government's chance of chance, are anything but current - but this is precisely why they are very revealing.
Especially if you compare them to current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the distribution area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.
The Bavarian digital atlas is a patchwork carpet that cannot be recognized as such.
More detailed maps for cities and municipalities, so-called UrUNK UNK, have been integrated into the large overview map.
According to the Bavarian surveying administration, the survey was created between 1810 and 1864 and the first survey of Bavaria was carried out.
Your client: Napoleon.
Since the spring of 1800, the French army commander occupied Bavaria during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - for military purposes, of course.
Although French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801: It was today's neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide map of Bavaria.
UNK st Max IV. Joseph drove the project further, founded the "UNK UNK Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian surveying administration.
The original exposure sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian National Library, like all the others.
The comparison UNK her / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated as a district in Munich 21 years after drawing up the map, that is, 1877.
Today, Untersendling lies in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendling concentrate around 1856 along the present Plinganserstrasse, which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, you see nothing but fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers appears: Hand-numbered flourpieces were derived from the so-called "UrUNK."
Small parcels no longer occupy farmers there - but small gardeners of the "Land in Sun" plant.
A large green area is located north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, which has been the site of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact still a meadow - not a concrete desert - in the 19th century.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In today's Au-Haidhausen district, in the UrUNK blatt, not only is the street name "at Gasteig" or from the hill "UNK der LüUNK" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."
Yes, here at the AuerUNK straße, people were once locked in with delusions.
In 1858 / 59, the Munich County Irrenanstalt "UNK der Auer LüUNK" was founded.
In 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwigs II.
"He was progressive for his time and finished, for example, the anchor of the so-called irors.
He also banned the use of force against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Haidhausen Museum, who has worked with the Anstalt for an exhibition.
There was room for 280 patients at first, and it was then extended to 500 places.
At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the UNK sirrenanstalt in UNK 1905.
The Isar-Amper hospital in Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been located there since 2006.
In the area of the former Auer Anstalt young people are now meeting in Salesianum in Munich.
The order bought the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities.
To the west is the football pitch of TSV München Ost, east of homes from the 1980 "s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in architectural terms along the lines of the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks.
The Marienplatz was listed as the "main square" around 1856, while the Kaufinger street was called "Kaufinger UNK."
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
In December 1944, the Allied bombs took many holes into the city centre.
A big one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval mine chapel were once at the Marianshof, where the preparatory work was carried out these days and on 5 April 2017 the second S-Bahn railway stop was held.
The slider can be used to compare the old Munich map with the aerial photo of today - and to fill the hole at the Marienhof.
He reports that those waiting in queues for the security check repeatedly ask what the problem is and receive the answer from the security officials "There is no problem."
By and large, it ran smoothly in most places, even if it was quite inefficient in the hospital - people were stuck in a long queue. "
I left the polling station at around 17: 00 and the queue was about one kilometre long.
A snake in front of a Takoyaki shop.
Ahmad Shuja has uploaded a photo on Twitter, where people are queuing up in a long queue to get their voting card.
In some polling stations in Malawi, the queues were so long that people could not see the polling site at the end of the queue.
"Today the serpent is long," she observes while she goes.
Normally there is an extra snake for the students.
"And they have closed the serpent for the students, but it is important," continues Vicki and ignores Arlet.
Civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Farming has issued a warning to colored people who travel to Missouri for discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the state.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to take special care when travelling through the state.
A recent Missouri law that makes it harder for people to seek discrimination, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state that disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, said NAACP.
"You have violations of citizens' rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten up or killed, "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet."
It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the US.
The group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more petrol during the state's journey and was detained by the police in Missouri without being accused of a crime.
The Council also draws attention to a recent report by the office of the Attorney General of Missouri, which shows that 75% black motorists in the state are more likely to be stopped than whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends, and employees about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People must be prepared to bring in deposits or let relatives know that they are travelling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate speech reporting program, which ranked the state at 16 in terms of the number of such injuries.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had passed immigration laws, which require local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for abuse of migration, which is what the LU considers.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the foreign ministry to other countries, but lately, interest groups have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the US.
There are about 13 centres of establishment in the north-western border province, and in Baluchistan there are 30 more, but smaller ones.
We must no longer look at the problem from the point of view of participation or non-participation, and therefore go to one of the two opposing camps.
At present, in southern Afghanistan, logistics centres, rolling transport and the development of international airports are creating the military conditions for controlling Baluchistan and for reaching the Indian Ocean.
Hospitals and hospitals, as well as camps near the border, have been plundered.
There are guarded United Nations camps every day and night.
The Israeli Government assured the presidency that security measures would be strengthened around Palestinian camps.
With the re-opening of the camps, with the suppression of the residential areas of ordinary people by the police and mass arrests in the early hours of the morning, the regime wanted to react brutally, in our view, in a scandalous manner.
This organisation has limited responsibility for providing assistance to refugees living outside the camps.
There are indeed countries in which there is a kind of revolt around the camps, because the local population feels that the refugees in the camps are better placed than they are themselves.
Their camps are being bombed.
They preserve the camps of torture and the workshops of death as memorials and symbols.

Mr President, I would like to conclude by saying that we are satisfied with the electoral process, but not so much with the demobilisation, since the Honduran Government has stopped the international organisations mentioned in the Tela Convention from doing so.
It is thus placing itself in the camp of those who are putting the brakes on European development, those who see strengthening the EC as a provocation towards Moscow and Eastern Europe, which is a very regrettable development.
We welcome everything that the Commission has done and I am sure that the Commissioner will insist on a thorough investigation of the camps when he visits the camps.
Many people died in opposition, others fled to camps in the adjacent Papua New Guinea (PNG), but there too they cannot feel safe.
I agree with the honourable Member about the importance of maintaining concentration camps for future generations as a testament to Nazi crimes against humanity, but I believe that the sites of several camps have already been permanently protected for the reasons mentioned by the honourable Member.
I visited a different camp from Mrs Ewing: A camp with 97 000 refugees on the border with Somalia, which was maintained by non-governmental organisations, the European Community and other donors.
Without name, I would like to say that there are two camps in the 'no-sayers'.
It seems, however, that various of these camps are under the constant protection of the competent national and / or local authorities.
I thought that the old left-wing and Rousseau Nazi utopia had long since been buried, responsible for the millions of deaths of the gulags and the camps of Communist China.
Parts of the population are deported to camps in the Arab north, with the sole aim of depriving the Nuba people of their Christian faith and culture.
The Community and its Member States have also condemned the existence of detention centres, particularly in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and have called for the camps to be opened up immediately for an international inspection and to be dissolved as soon as possible.
This can also be blamed on the Lebanese Government, which has no other political objective than to allow aid organisations to access the provisional camp by refusing to allow deportees to enter the country, nor by refusing to allow them to take advantage of it.
For a few weeks, after the discovery of the camps, we have discovered the rapes.
This attention and financial support must not be limited to the camps located in the territory of the Community, but must also apply, if not primarily, to the camps located in the rest of Europe.

Weidezaunprojekt is Elemental
The UNK bacher WeideUNK n project is a success project and will be continued next year.
The CDU-Bundestag-appointed Peter UNK and Kordula Kovac have presented themselves with a picture on the spot.
The UNK demann family's legal court brought together representatives of the CDU local association of fishermen, together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members of parliament.
Markus UNK demann initially provided insights into his farm, in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplies 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and houses them in five holiday homes.
For him the "Black Forest Milk" is the alternative-free marketing route for the milk of his cows, UNK demann said.
On the table of the holiday guests are exclusively regional.
Since he is also chairman of BLHV UNK bach, he called the Weidezaunprojekt "UNK ar UNK."
I cannot be profitable on such steep areas.
The green area care for a lot of work, much has to be done with the Motorsense.
"Here we have to contend with the conditions and with the topography," UNK demann stressed.
In 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not run a bio-farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality recognized the importance of the Weidezaunproject and is pleased with the support of the Leader."
Farmers would have to be supported at a cost of between EUR 3000 and EUR 4000 per hectare.
It is hoped that this will allow the afforestation of the land to continue for a long time.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how to continue their operations," stressed the Mayor.
Farmers are often criticised for their support.
In 2013, a total of 25 plots of 11 participants were fenced in via the WeidezaunUNK.
The area of disclosure is 40 hectares, which cannot be replanted until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500, half was supported by Leader, a quarter was financed by the municipality of UNK bach.
Thus, farmers remained EUR 12 610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of ditch.
"The great advantage is the longevity of fences," UNK demann explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You are doing a really good job, without farmers and rural women it is not possible."
Peter UNK also said: "Best food is produced here."
The Baden-Württemberg Landscape Plant Directive (LPR) enables the state to promote soft fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
A prerequisite is the existence of a support framework known by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced in must not be subject to heavy-duty management (35% slope) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
The UNK bacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 parcels, who want to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence.
The area of disclosure corresponds to 35 hectares and the calculated cost is more than €112 000.

Now, Trump's White House is taking over the statue of Liberty.
The surest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.
Americans value them, as do any others - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have laughed him if he had done so.
But he attacked their meaning, and in particular the meaning that was attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to his base in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument.
When Miller Acosta shouted: "I don't want to go into a whole thing about history, but the statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem to which you refer, which was added later and is not part of the original statue of Liberty. "
Miller is factually correct, but, as he put it himself, it is not really about history.
It is about the contemporary response to Lazarus's stirring words, the only one in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your waste, your poor, your weeds, your masses."
There has never been a time when the "miserable waste" on our screens was better to see.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's US.
This conflict, because of the importance of a statue, is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: It is indeed a conflict over America's importance.
Lazarus - and her friends, who fought to place their words on the ground after their death - knew very well that they took a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by portraying the feminine embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classic image.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of the exiles.
The combination of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, the right-wing people wanted to change it for a long time.
The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John of the Baptist for Trump's coming, argued in 2010 that the statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone, but rather a neo-conservative early world that brought the American flame.
It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not intended to illuminate the way to the United States. "
Limbaugh has come up with something quite unusual
The significance of the statue is very much a question of the position of perception.
The great fanciful act of Lazarus was to see it as seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the decks of ships.
It is a matter of literally seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives.
Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.
And that, of course, is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.
Their torchlight is not intended to illuminate the path, but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team.
Neil Black, UK track and field performance director, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent will "make a massive contribution to the team in the World Cup."
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017, which will start on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and that the United Kingdom's athletics must learn something from it.
"We welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find it," said Black.
"I am talking to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that it has something to do with what they have done.
Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the type on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. "
Several of the Scottish athletes are medals-winners, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain by the team.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether Scottish or whatever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought in naturally were great. "
The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in the 400 m hurdles at their fifth World Cup, says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's best total of athletes at the World Cup so far was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Muir, a medium-distance runner, leads along this path, and last year set five British and two European records.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.
Chris O Azores Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scot to watch after a great season that included the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Cup, when the only other Scot in team Lee McConnell was.
The team captain says that she is "immensely proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases they will also mix at the medals and the Finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but she added to know that my team mates voted for me."
"Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team.
It only shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb up to podiums.
What is my speech as a captain?
Yes, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, because we have a World Home Championship.
So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go and compete there and it will simply be a great atmosphere out there. "
We wanted to create an audio platform that offers a space for emerging talent from a wide variety of regions in the region.
Overall, the EP supported the harmonisation proposals by a large majority, even though certain victims of parties and certain deviations from the usual policy in some Member States were called for, because it was clear that no major progress could be made without harmonization of cost factors and legislation.
The need, the advantages and the gradual realisation of such a project must be recognised and felt by all, so that the sacrifices and necessary sacrifices are made on a voluntary basis.
But how can we demand these victims from our peoples, our voters, when the same constituents read about such violations of human rights every day in the newspaper?
Nevertheless, I believe that farmers are prepared to make these short-term sacrifices so that the long-term health of the people can be improved.
Mr Berkhouwer pointed out how bitter this is for athletes who have been victims for years to have taken care of themselves to attend this event.
This is not a question of refusing to make a sacrifice, but of the impossibility of going back to the constituency in time and returning on Monday morning.
The captives of Tunis have not died otherwise, if their victim triggers a legitimate indictment against the regime of Bourguiba, this sprat of the so-called free world, and if they may resist any confirmation of the need for human rights violations.
It is true that they have spoken with the feeling of a woman, a democrat, an anti-fascist fighter who has known the victim.
This is borne out by the commitment and sacrifices - including to people - to which some of the newcomers were and continue to be ready for this country and its people by deploying troops to the UN peace forces.
But it also means convincing others that, if necessary, they are prepared to make sacrifices for these values.
In view of this situation, it seems logical that a co-responsibility levy should also be levied on the fats of vegetable and maritime origin imported into the Community on preferential terms in return for the victims demanded of milk producers.
This also explains the heroic victims of Bobby Sands, O'Brien Hara, Hughes, MacCreesh and, unfortunately, yesterday, after sixty-day hunger strike, late Joe MacDonnell, who enjoy the public support and support of Irish Catholics.
This is what is meant by the word 'victims'.
Our idea demands some sacrifices on the part of the rich.
The Olympic fighters from many countries who bravely made enormous personal sacrifices also believed that the Community would keep its promise.
It is no use imposing heavy sacrifices on ourselves if our competitors exploit them for their own growth.
And the success of the Camp David agreement shows just how, for the first time in history, the military victors have made material sacrifices so that peace returns.
This action - and I would say this - will be a great sacrifice on the part of the population and of the workers, victims which they will have to suffer if they do not quite clearly find their justification for the efficiency of the installations and the balance between surplus and deficit.
Thirdly, account must be taken of the great efforts and sacrifices Luxembourg has made to restructure its steel industry since the beginning of the steel crisis, in other words since 1975.
Enlargement would pose a dramatic threat to the Spanish fishing industry, and even that sacrifice could not prevent our production capacity from being substantially reduced.
There has been considerable concern about the fact that victims - because victims were eventually required - would have to be brought equally by farmers in all countries.
We say quite clearly that we are not standing with our backs to the wall and do not need to impose new sacrifices on small and medium-sized farmers; it is different.
The agriculture ministers have been realistic and I know that all our farmers will be prepared to make some sacrifices in order to promote the long-term viability and stability of the common agricultural policy.
However, the victims must be distributed equally among the Member States, and I strongly reject the fact that British farmers are worse off than their European counterparts.
Bearing in mind that we must all participate equally in the happy and unpleasant events of the Community and that it now requires sacrifices if the economy is to get back on track, we accept the proposals for price increases in the Woltjer report.
The members of the PPE-DE even go so far as to demand a fair distribution of victims in the resolution they have signed with others.
We must also remember that if the democratic parties of Europe had been vigilant and determined, this sacrifice might not have been necessary for so many.
However, these efforts will have to continue for a while, otherwise all the sacrifices that have been made so far, particularly in terms of jobs, would have been pointless.
A civilised state must avoid the sacrifice of those who are not involved.
The economic losses, the number of human victims in the fight against fires, the costs are so high that they can no longer be borne by individuals, by the Autonomous Communities, by urban and local authorities, thereby causing serious economic shocks.
It goes without saying that several important parts of the programme have been affected by this reduction, particularly research in the field of aviation.
That is why it would be unfair to remember only one part of the victims and not to mention the other part.
Everyone who has a bit of common sense knows that we must be able to compromise and make sacrifices if we live together twelve times.
Through this sacrifice, they have been able effectively to shake up international conscience and create a wave of solidarity with the Afghan people, which is now culminating in this victory.
But in the name of what objective are we being asked to make all these great efforts, all these upheavals and all these victims?
In line with these efforts, producers outside the Community should make similar sacrifices if they are to achieve a more stable balance on world markets.
The Polish people, who have been suffering for years from the shortage and scarcity of basic products, have just embarked on an ambitious process of rehabilitation and economic reform, which will demand further efforts and sacrifices from this courageous and patient people.
The families of the Sellafield employees are now being asked to make a final sacrifice.
Only then will all the soldiers of Europe, whose blood, as a fiery ornament for the victims of the past, protect the door threshold of every house in this area and have each plot soaked in fields, meadows and gardens, peace.
On the contrary, they would lead to increased social and national sacrifices, especially for the weakest nations.
They have worked generation by generation and have made serious sacrifices.
I am told that every country must make sacrifices in order to build a well-organised, integrated and efficient community, both small and large.
Pakistan is a country that has already made great sacrifices in the war in Afghanistan with the reception of millions of refugees.
Beyond these very general plans, we should not forget that there are special cases, such as the case of Poland, which as a whole will be the first objects to initiate the democratic process and which have been prepared to become victims of it.
Parliament should approve measures which the United States agrees with, but which demand a great sacrifice on the part of European farmers.
The sinking of fishing boats by submarines can be avoided and I urge the Commission and the governments of the Member States to agree immediately on the appropriate procedures to ensure that the Cold Sea fishermen 's last war was brought to the fore.
We knew that war was the victim of politics.
I believe that the Council must take care to ensure that something is done for the minorities that remain, even in a smaller Yugoslavia; in particular, the victims of Bosnia-Herzegovina also need attention.
The one-net rule proposed will impose different hardships and sacrifices on fishermen in different regions and waters, which will not be fair by the bank.
While this is a unique achievement in the history of international maritime transport (due to the self-sacrifice of the crew and the proper coordination of rescue operations by the captain in extremely difficult weather conditions, not a single victim was born).
We will all have to make sacrifices in our way of life, in production and in consumption.
Secondly, the principle of safety and environmental protection must be strengthened, standards and European and international controls must be improved throughout the cycle, from shipbuilding to ports and shipping, and this has led to more and more serious accidents being brought to a halt.
That is why both the Moroccan authorities and the public have used their links with the Community as an essential element in their internal political discussion, because it has enabled them to 'sell' their own people, so to speak, to a more stable and stable future.
I would like governments to take an example of those people who are more committed and more victims in the face of such a human tragedy.
But the question is whether we have the means to achieve our objectives and whether we have the courage to explain to our respective populations what sacrifices they have to make, so that we can use sufficient resources to achieve our objectives.
We cannot, of course, be guided by selfishness when it comes to the necessary restructuring, but by a clear attitude on the part of the Commission, so that the victims of the social partners and the investment efforts of recent decades will not be wasted.
In my country, beef is the most important agricultural export item - no other product has that meaning - and because we export 80% of our total beef production, the whole GATT issue has been brought to our attention and it is quite certain that we will pay.
The restructuring of the market and the balance between supply and demand are to be found in the restriction of production, even if this solution is difficult in view of the victims involved.

Block critics on Facebook: Don't worry about a public office if you cannot sustain voters "heating up
The father of our country knew something of bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long for newspapers to beat him for everything, from domestic politics to its political principles.
He shunned the criticism, certainly.
But he has not silenced his critics.
After all, in 1783, Washington said: "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, like the sheep, we are fought for battles."
That brings me to Maryland as Governor Larry Hogan, who must work to be more like Washington.
Hogans employees have blocked and deleted contributions from at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union suspended him at the beginning of this week.
The staff of the governor dismissed the action as frivol, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Na, and?."
"It's just Facebook," said many people.
But it is important.
And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is remarkably popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary hogan head.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.
He was also very adept in using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his constituents and playing his hair-free head after chemotherapy on his side.
Thus, blocking people who come to the side of the Governor - a public forum that is called official and paid by public-tax dollars - is unnecessary and, ultimately, dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it is too easy to use the image of troll or spammers or hateful-filled people who swing the whip online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders: A teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, not trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profan.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Law lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crime and other current news," wrote it in the commentary section of the message "The Post."
"I do not appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject, some people regard it as a so-called collective action rather than as a large group of citizens affected."
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack," others would probably call "intercession."
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if you had done the same thing, if staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
But that is exactly what is happening digital.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for impacting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this issue came last week in Virginia.
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated First Amendment, according to US district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
This should not be so difficult.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable car had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous writers suggested his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticising his position on the Amity Treaty, trade and shipping with the United Kingdom overpower his office, according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project's online papers.
But he has not silenced them.
Freedom of speech, difference of opinion and discourses are at the heart of our nation.
True leadership means accepting that.
One week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks declared that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley ordinary shares at the same price of $25.25, creating a total amount of $3 billion.

Poverty and death in Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cook the dinner, it does not use a stove.
It even rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the UNK ai rain in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charted bulb is taken from and swallowed with eager, unwashed hands.

It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was taken in Indonesia in 1969 after a disputed referendum, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public landing in front of the occupying forces.
An existing movement that fought for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which controls the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is, and includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire, followed by a romantic 5-hour drive by car.

In 2015 alone, Freeport has mined gold and copper worth $3.1 billion.
Moreover, Papua has an estimated $78 billion worth of wood resources.
But these riches are a source of misery for Papua, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military maintain a suffocating presence.
A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goose and are mercilessly treated.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and detained by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papuan's tribal highland in the 1970 "s became genocide in accordance with the Asia Commission on Human Rights.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We Are All VerUNK" is said in a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which includes reports of last year's atrocities, such as unlawful executions and torture - rape and violent attacks are particularly popular after another report.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have increased as Papuas's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic changes are occurring as Muslim economic migrants come from the densely populated islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Warung Cantins sell fried chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetables served with peanuts.
Local people are fighting to stay here.
"The migrants have begun selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old panic indigenous who moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura.
"It has cost the indigenous Papua - the mum [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi by the people, promised to address the inequalities and violations of rights in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including UNK ai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua, little has changed, and today the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
Indeed, only two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October, UNK ai suffered a low.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was out and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through darkness on a motorcycle.
The fervent children told them that they should turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offense on their tone and later came back with four soldiers, according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk jaded and beat the group with their rifles, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, the 16-year-old Yulianus YUNK o, was beaten so badly that he fell into the coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women, and children gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting arches and performed the Waita dance - continuously and imitating a bird song - by Papuas Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators began to throw stones on police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot it dead," it is said in an official document released by TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto quarter of Enarotali, saw the threat and called for calm and urged the crowd to return home.
Nobody was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot into my left wrist," he said TIME on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who fired, but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overflowing, many shots were fired," he adds.
The native man Alfius Youw was hit three times, so his cousin, who was a witness to the shooting.
"I ran to him and studied his body to make sure that he was," said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, bears only one name, the TIME in dark mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Yotje Mende, the chief spector of Papua Police, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because they were attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the Speaker of Papua Police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It is about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many others injured.
The news of the killings was only 'filtered' to Jakarta the following day.
Three weeks in Jayapura, Jokowi delivered a passionate speech expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the historical grievances in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an out-of-court mechanism for resolving historical violations of human rights.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90's and early 2000's.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to be passed, "he said.
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on 5 June, saying that he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, accused by the UN of "crimes against humanity," which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody vote of 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved.
Families of the victims of the panic responded with fierce infidence.
"I have been interviewed four times over the last three years, but no progress has been made," says Yohanes.
"I am tired."
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I am afraid," he says.
"I am afraid to be arrested by the military is afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people of UNK ai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says that he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After I had buried the corpses, the military looked for me," he says.
The foundries have not stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot at villagers in UNK ais neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring an unconscious man to hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man who was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned when he was fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company's location office.
The police said that villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say that the mobile Brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panicked, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and was witness to how the injured were quickly admitted here.
"I have been hiding for two days in my house."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for the police's mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
UNK ai has always been a trouble for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the discontent of the tribesmen Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend Papua's rights by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings by Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from UNK ai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, thousands of people in UNK ai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in recent years, on the pretext of "safeguarding national sovereignty."
Some never appear again.
Among the people of Papua, UNK ai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty strengthens discontent.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
The people here are building everything they eat: Nota and fruit and vegetables.
Agriculture is the job of women, who can deal with four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between native Papua and the new migrants have grown, and have increased since the opening of new routes to Nabire airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the more educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely has the capital or the skills needed to run their own businesses in a competitive manner.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the UNK ai tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
Moreover, restrictions on reporting remain tense for international media.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck ESCUDIE and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with associated institutions from Papua, although they were granted rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the Asia Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Jowi's campaign promises to lift reporting restrictions in order to promote transparency and development were not realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report Indonesia's most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: Visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on Indonesia's government remains largely confined to Papuas's immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - called for the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread violations" in Papua.
The OPM has historically supported the same countries.
The spokesperson of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrmanatha Nasir, rejected the group's accusations and said journalists in Jakarta: "Indonesia still has a democratic system to cover up and there is free media, so it is difficult.
People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura visited on May 4, locals broke their silence and urged him to attend "We want freedom," according to a meeting.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papua say that they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the UNK ai shots," says Gobai, leader of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that, apart from being under the constant threat of a predatory military, the people of UNK ai are in poor educational and health services.
Gobai says that the Phalai people, like other Papua, regard their voice for Jokowi as a "guilt" that he must repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, families of the victims of panic carried out a final symbolic act of Trotsk: The suffering of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they may never have justice, but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with sintered head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire capture the "Torch" skyscraper of Dubai for the second time
A fire found its passage on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-metre-high 79-storey building.
It is the second fire which, in just two years' time, sweeps through the high-rise building, which one happens to call the Torch Tower (torch-tower).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we stood up at fire alarm and shouting people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50 floor, "told a resident who gave his name as George, Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said that fire-fighting units shot fire at around 4: 00 p.m. local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said that it is working to provide shelter for those affected.
The incident can revive issues related to the safety of materials used in the outer areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 showed that most of the damage was caused by the fairing, the exterior covering for decoration or insulation.
In the United Kingdom, the police said that they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cladding at the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which around 80 people died.

No Davis Cup Reform: Continued Best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) was defeated at the General Assembly with his large Davis Cup Coup.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup single only on two win rates was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-sentence classic, which is often very long, but which is also very much appreciated, remains the traditional competitor.
63.54% of member countries voted in favour of the reform, so ITF President David Haggerty's goal has been narrowly missed.
"We respect this decision, but we are disappointed that our Member States have not adopted the entire package of reforms for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions, "said Haggerty.

As is well known, the two players lost a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several Fouls, so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead his group, the two players will comply with the required penalty against the Auxerre for the next game, and thus enter the next phase without cards.
The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more common in the world of football.
Obviously, the advantage is that players start the next stage of the Champions League without cards threatening their participation in a future game.

More than 1 out of 5 U.S. travelers brings prohibited items to the aircraft, finds a survey
A survey of air passengers found that more than 20% deliberately or unknowingly prohibited items were smuggled past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6% of which were flying while accidentally carrying KUNK or others.
Less than 1% claimed that they had discovered late that they had mistakenly traveled with firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
The survey among more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers tend to flout the rules.
Of those questioned who confessed that they knowingly tried to fly with something forbidden by TSA, 19.7% were Millennium als, compared to less than 15% who were members of Generation X.
The most common items deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3% admitted that they had knowingly carried objects with blades through security checks, while 2.2% of female respondents and 3.7% of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately introduced banned drugs into the aircraft.
The company said it had questioned travellers across the country to see how many accidentally smuggled goods would have been through airport security and how many would have deliberately done so.
It is no surprise that the people most likely to carry smuggled goods - knowingly or unknowingly - through security were those who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure about what liquids they can take with them or how much of them.
So it is no surprise that the bulk of the liquids seized by TSA are liquids.
For a while, people thought that TSA could view books as smuggled goods.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel orders
UNK-UNK endsassa Elon Musk likes to give with the huge number of preorders for his new Tesla "Model 3."
He has so far failed to understand that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla's chief executive Elon Musk has for the first time revealed a different, less glossy figure in the announcement of the latest quarterly balance sheet.
In the last few months Musk has frequently promoted the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, which is just beginning to be delivered.
Now Musk admits: Of the 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will pay the €1000 (US $1000 and UK £1000) "Reservation Payment."
Currently, 455,000 of these non-binding reservations were made, Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12% of all orders could be a problem.
His argument is that the challenge to ambitious growth targets lies not in demand, but in production.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018 - all the models put together - it should be 500,000, and in 2020 it should be one million.
The demand for this is obvious.
According to Musk, 1,800 reservations are currently made per day.
If you order a "Model 3" today, you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines, which have never been tested in practice, without major interruptions at maximum capacity.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are major delays, the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.

One day after being taken to court by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era's rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive than previous administrations to the needs of public environmental authorities.
He did not mention the action brought against his previous office in a federal court of appeal.
It is a deadline which expired on 1 October for states to meet the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time, study the plan and avoid "interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth."
Pruitt, who was before his appointment by President Donald Trump's Public Prosecutor in Oklahoma, was for a long time a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry are resisting.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitts's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPO administrator exceeded his authority when he sought to commit the implementation of an Obama administration rule delaying oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane emissions.
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his U-turn on ozone standards simply reinforces CEPOL's willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Among previous administrations, CEPOL has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others, and to agree on the date for implementation," said Prulauitt, the job of the EPO.
"We do not believe in legal regulation and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority we have seriously. "
Nevertheless, the EPO's opinion stated that Pruitt will eventually use its "power to delay and all other legal powers" to ensure that the rules are "based on sound policy and the best available information."
Congressional Republicans are pressing for a more comprehensive overhaul of ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is intended to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
The New York Attorney General, Eric UNK derman, who led the coalition of states that had been sued by CEPOL this week, said that the group intended to maintain legal pressure.
"The reversal of CEPOL - after our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their tailoring communities."
New York joined in this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Ground-ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power stations, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems for sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths every year.
Representatives of public health and environmentalists applauded Pruitts "surprising change of course.
"It is disturbing how much pressure it needs to get this reasonable step from the person responsible for the protection of the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the Trump administration's ideological crusade to bend to polluters and their special interests."

Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 Years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen is invited to a Serenade on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 p.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made Tumlingens their concern.
Walter Martini emphasises: "It is a unique village jewel."
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the Württemberg Book of UrUNK: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and the VogUNK to Horgb."
According to the wording of the document, on Tumlinger Berg, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a stately court, one of which belonged to the church or the right of patronage, and not the other way round.
So there were also people living there.
As can be seen from the description of the Upper Office of Freudenstadt in 1858, next to the Unterdorf and Oberdorf, which can still be seen today in the village of Tumlingen, the "mountain" of the third village.
Old maps dating back to the year 1600 underpin these historical realities.
The law of patronage was established from the early medieval law of the church.
A gentleman who built a church, abandoned it and occupied it with a priest, remained the owners of that church and was able to inherit this own church.
This involved the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The biggest of the two crumbled at Christmas 1673.
The newly created bell then sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the windows were taken and the bell parts were stolen.
The room was very small.
In 1796, French troops moved near the church.
They broke the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from hearing-welding.
In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilary Church was abandoned.
Only the church tower was left standing.
In 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
In order to prevent an accident, the tower was broken down.
Only the tower tower tower still exists today was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the "UNK UNK" as successor to Dieter Dockhorn take care of the Hilarius facility.
As the organiser, the friends and supporters invite Tumlingens on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth Serenade in the old cemetery to the St. HilariusUNK.
This is designed by the Combo des Kepler-GyUNK ums Freudenstadt and with speeches by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
UNK vorUNK er Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The programme will start at 4.30 p.m.
Admission is from 3.30 pm.
At the end of the Serenade, there is a trunk in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest," the organizers will reveal the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is important for tumours and hearing welders.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingens are particularly committed to home care, as Serenade-Organisator Walter Martini reaffirms.
Association wants to have wind wheels approved
"Boisheim resists" does not see any legal condition for the construction and has therefore turned to the land council.
The Association "Boisheim has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette, as at that time only the city limit to Schwalmtal had wind power.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are possible in principle, but at the same time the concentration zone results in the exclusion of the use of wind energy for the rest of the city.
The aim of these areas is to prevent the landscape from being "saved."
The city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by amending the land-use plan - but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a formal error.
"As a result of the lack of planning law, the granting of a permit is still illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of Boisheim.
Current state of affairs: The town council decided again before the summer break the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; the district government has yet to approve it.
Statement: "This excludes from planning the granting of an authorisation for the construction of wind turbines."
The circle confirms the receipt of the request.
"The relevant letters have been received by Viersen County since last week," said a speaker.
The circle is giving them the opportunity to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not expected to result in the procedure being stopped.
With a view to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, on Thursday the circle did not want to comment on the content of the arguments put forward by the association "Boisheim wUNK sich."
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning to build four 200 meter wind wheels on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
Last year, the company in which the town of Viersen is indirectly involved had already entered into lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.
The construction of the four wind turbines is intended to meet the electricity needs of around 11 400 households - equivalent to about one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four households.
The NEW Re wants to invest about 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen's town council gave the go-ahead for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a stake in a wind energy plant in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
Benedict It belongs to us, it is our future, "he added, after having entered a theatrical pause to look at the huge map behind him.
So the emphasis on the civil character and form of association does not merely serve to circumvent the legal hurdles that may arise when registration in court - it is also a political strategy.

City and shopkeepers plan "home shopping" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are expected to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The business association and the city administration want to take advantage of the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the residents to shop in the city centre.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "Home Shopping" weekend is intended to make customers aware of what offers their own city has to offer away from the usual supermarket goods.
It is therefore planned to create a market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies will present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city centre are to be invited to the "midnight shopping."
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearby region.
In preparation are advertising spots on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags that indicate the event weekend, Christian König said.
The city administration and the business association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
This is another stage of the project "UNK UNK UNK UNK."
These include new offers such as the first "active day" to the Brunnenfest including Sunday's sales announcement, talks with all traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively.
Also attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential is to be re-developed or re-developed.
This includes spa guests and tourists.
But many locals would also have lost sight of the city centre when shopping.
At the end of the day, everyone would have to help revive the city centre, including landlords, businesses throughout the city and clubs.
It was necessary to overcome lethargy with a network, some of which had spread, King said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, director of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringia cities are participating for the first time in the third "home shopping" day in Germany.
In addition to Bad Langensalza these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and UNK cherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities," he stressed.
The action under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his / her purchasing behaviour can influence his / her own direct environment.

The report concludes: "To meet global demand, private-sector investment must increase by 20-30 to 200-300 billion dollars a year, assuming that government and philanthropic funds double."
The essence of the "This Time is Different" syndrome lies in the assumption that crises only concern others.
Behind this is the assumption that behind the longest chain there is a majority of users.
Our estimates are based on the assumption that profit growth is in line with expectations.
Assuming that government spending and philanthropy double in the medium term, private-sector investment will have to increase by 20-30 to meet the required financial needs.
Assuming that the value added of the suppliers falls in Switzerland, the purchases of the major banks generate an added value of around CHF 2.4 billion and 19 275 jobs.
The fact that the relatively low-cost cushion has a future is a real assumption:
And this assumption already takes into account the stricter capital requirements that will apply to Swiss banks from 2018.
Assuming that the CHF will still slightly depreciate from the current level, we are lowering our forecast for GDP growth in Switzerland in 2015 from 1.6% to 0.8%.

Trump put pressure on Mexico for paying the border wall after leaked transcripts of telephone calls
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called on Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to to stop publicly saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US President shouted at him because he publicly denounced the wall, saying to him: "You cannot tell the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the US's southern border, and swore to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed tense exchanges.
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the US had proposed to take over refugees who emigrated to Australia "ridiculously," mies "and" stupid, "and that the insisting on trade was introduced by the Obama administration.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he said to Mr Turnbull, "this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
I was led down to a tavern where the conductor asked me to eat, but since I had no appetite, he left me alone in a large room, at the end of which there was a fireplace.
And all this you see with the appearance of an oil lamp that depends on the ceiling, and that of a bright camel fire, next to which I had to relax in coat and hat, my muff and umbrella just lie on the table.
After I went along the long gallery covered with carpets, I blew the shiny oak staircase down; then I came to the hall; here I stood a minute still; I looked at some copper engravings on the walls.
She climbed down from her chair and came to me to sit on my lap; then she seriously folded her little hands, threw her locks back, hedged her eyes to the ceiling of the current and began to sing a melody.
It was a large, stately mixture, with purpuristic furniture and curtains, a Turkish carpet, wood-clad walls, a large colored window and a richly carved ceiling.
I still see them in their raging passion when we had pushed them to the last - they poured our tea, crumbled our butter bread, threw our books up to the ceiling, and made a colorful muddle with the blanket.

But not her circle, but the man, he had pulled his mouth wide and looked to the ceiling.
Although there was no direct access to light, it was not completely dark, because some departments had to go against the aisle instead of single boards of simple wooden lattices, but to the ceiling they could see through some light and through them.
He liked to hang especially on the ceiling; it was quite different from the deck-chairs on the floor; one could breathe more freely; a slight swinging went through the body; and in the almost happy slippage he was there.

Moores Ford Massacre: Activists re-launch racist Lynchakt as a call for justice
A 1948-he Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in the rural Monroe, Georgia, and went to the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with rifles appeared to block his way.
The leader of the MUNK - a middle-aged man in a needle striker's suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates were in fear.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" Snug the man
"Get him out of the car!"
Shrines torn the silence when a young black man was torn apart from the front-passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on 22 July, is only a reflection.
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger," almost all of them met very real sighs in the audience.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night when two black couples - Roger Dorothy and Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorynsey - were trained by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with murders.
"It is truly incredible that in all these years, not one person has been arrested - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyron Brooks, who helps to organise the post.
"It is a stain on a story, but it is a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old Congressman of the State of Georgia and a civil rights activist for a lifetime.
For him, reproduction serves as a dramatic appeal to action, and is an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want an end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need justice," he said.
"We cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A forensic practitioner puts a blanket on the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford Lynch on 27 July 1946.
According to FBI records received from NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynchtrial.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained free for decades, civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: Politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the pre-election campaign in the summer.
Roughly at the same time as the election, according to the FBI, the black farmer Roger Malcom has set down a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly for a woman.
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester slept with Malcoms Dorothy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when they moved away from prison and approached Moore Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," this concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there has been a plot between state and local prosecution, which has not only been involved in the murders, removed evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses."
Brooks makes it even more concise.
"It was an electoral massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community:" If you register and if you vote, you will be able to do so here. "
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene conducted the annual reproduction of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their portrayal is vivid, profound, and is rooted in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe is no longer in America.
It is hard to look, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that this is the point.
"We do not want to talk about lynching, because then we will be confronted with its hype in all of us," she said.
"But I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have gone through."
Rehearsals for this year's production started in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of blacks - pushed into a room and lauded when Greene started a well-played overview.
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes Co-director.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said that the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not so," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The play begins with Malcom, who is hitting him and wobbling him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- he, vanishes from my property!"
Rascona reciprocates the fire.
There is a pause.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!," Rascona asked.
It is alarmed and confused.
Was I too tough?
"No," Greene said, still laughing.
"I simply do not think that white people said 'n --- he' at the time."
"But," one of the other black actors quipped.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R.'.
And that is exactly where the energy in the room is shifting, a feeling of camera replaces the unease.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it sharply and forcefully.
No one laughs at all.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are cries, shots and then silence.
A woman dressed with a dream dress is standing above the bodies of the actors and delivering the laughing words "Strange Fruit" to Billie Holidays.
Your voice breaks with every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen viewers blur sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many only come down the road.
They have experienced Georgia's depressing moisture every almost eight hours when Brooks takes her on a pilgrimage to the Tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you are on the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels spooky.
When the last notes of the song end, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpse name.
Children hoard at their heads, register the fake blood and the quiet body and whisper each other.
"They are not really dead," a little boy is murdering as if he wanted to remember it.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over.
The actors throw the LynchUNK away and wipe out their tears.
Bradshaw surrounded Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona is surrounded by two of his fellow players and then breaks into their arms, and the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know that this is not in your heart.
You did so for one reason. "
Later, the audience meets the actors for dinner.
A white pair from Atlanta chat at a table, excited about the post with a black pair they have just met.
Denise Duplinski fought to find words that have left behind the performance.
"It is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds... coming from people who look like you and who do so because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does with me leads me to believe that lynching is still going on," she added, "today it is called only police shooting."
In the same room, Tyron Brooks Court keeps his table, he eats and reminds of civil rights.
He said he had already started to plan the performance next year.
"The adjustment is somewhat inspiring, because it describes the horrors of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"If we learn nothing from it, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, those who do not know their own history, are condemned to repeat it. "
"GötterUNK UNK" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf also sets himself on a colorful-frivole staging in a gigantic six-storey setting.
The turnstage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows either a shabby street corner with the wall rest and dönerbude in Berlin, a "plaste and elastste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Prior to this, an open Mercedes classic car, in which the RheinUNK cker poses as rockergirls, or UNK a Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels recall Castorfs's leitmotif - money, power, and greed - which runs through its "ring" staging.
The three butchers of the Rhine - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke LUNK kuhl and Alexandra Steiner - are harmonious as they were in the "Rheingold."
Kess seduce Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), in Hollywood style unravel a body in the boot and give the ties-clique.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully fiesen Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavy weight boxer.
Brutally the scene when he beats Siegfried.
Later Gunther (Markus UNK) must also believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Stormy celebrations include Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who is modest and forgets his hands to the Merkel-Raute.
There is great applause for the Festival Orchestra, which is showing itself for the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in empty leisure clothes.
The show was eagerly awaited by Frank Castorf and his team
If he had to go through an arrow concert in 2013, there was great jubilation five years later, with the sporadic "Buh" calls.
The festival's director, Katharina Wagner, should have been pleased to hear about this.
"You notice that the audience has grown together with the" Ring "in a way," she said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but also grew an understanding of its view.
I draw a positive conclusion.
Almost everyone -- except companies like ExxonMobil or US Vice-President Dick Cheney and their purchased scissors and misdirected followers -- understands that carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere when humans burn hydrocarbon, and that CO2 acts as a bottom.
Sufficient brightness, good contrast, flimmer freedom and reflection of the surface of the screen as well as high resolution and correct dimensioning of the signs are important for the legibility of the representation.
The finer the resolution of the screen, that is, the more "dots" per character are available, the better the readability of the information.
Graphic screens usually have a higher resolution than screens, which are only intended to display letters and numbers.
In practice, you can determine the effect of resolution and quality of representation by checking whether certain critical characters can be easily confused or not; pairs are easily distinguishable signs:
In its motion for a resolution, our group calls for the release of Souha Bechara and other political prisoners and for the dissolution of the Khiam camp.
Studies on the influence of topographical databases on the performance of external / internal propagation models in terms of data type, format (grid, vector) and resolution (in the area element and in height);
Guidelines for quality control / quality assurance, such as camera quality, spatial and temporal resolution, etc., can be proposed if they prove useful for this action.
Required configuration: PC with Pentium 100 Mhz (minimum) - 16 MB RAM (minimum) - CDROMReader at four speeds (minimum) - 15 MB free disk space - Superscreen 256 VGA color (640 resolution).
Other higher resolution databases can be used in case studies.
Among the international projects at regional and continental level are the CORINE and CORINE Phare projects at the EUA, which use TM recordings to highlight high resolution and accuracy, creating floor covering information for Europe.
They do not contain full resolution remote sensing images at this stage, although some samples of lower quality are available.
The five basic characteristics that describe the soil cover (wood-like, grass-like, clad soil, artificial (buildings), water) can be easily determined with Earth observation data (both low and high resolution) over large areas.
This option has allowed the creation of a high-quality map base, with an expected geometrical accuracy of 2.5 m (RMS) and a resolution of 1m.
In this case, with a geometrical resolution of 1m, each point can be clearly located, except for items whose resolution would be less than 1 meter.
The rule of thumb mentioned above must be revised if the geometric resolution of the image is low, that is, if a significant proportion of the objects to which one would like to estimate are covered by the presence of mixed pixels.
On the other hand, in the field of agro-meteorological models and methods for monitoring vegetation with medium-resolution satellites, there is still a lot to be done in terms of development and research.
The GEOSTAT geographical information system currently contains not only grid and point data with a resolution of 1 ha but also various vector data.
Integration, management and maintenance of various geocoded, spatial data available in the Swiss federal administration; these data should cover the entire country and have a spatial resolution of 100 m, which corresponds to a scale of 1: 25 000;
Data on the area development of a lower number of land use categories (possibly 20 or less) with a lower spatial resolution and accuracy could be published 1 or 2 times a year to close the data gap that arises from the aerial survey.
Remote sensing provides the data according to geometrical meshes of different sizes, depending on the resolution of the sensor (pixels).
In addition to the Merkmalsprogramm, the scale and geometric resolution (smallest different spatial unit), the nomenclature and the periodicity of the survey play a decisive role.
In the first year of the investigation in 1990, however, the selection of sample fields showed that very small fields can hardly be seen in the satellite picture at the relatively low geometric resolution of the currently available photographic material (LANDSAT TM: 30 m).
For the calculations, six of the seven spectral channels of the LANDSATpictures of July 1990 and April and July 1991 were used; the thermal channel was excluded because of its low resolution (120 k120 m2) it causes too many mixed pixels.
However, the intended improvement of the spectral resolution in the LANDSAT 6 will in any case have a positive effect on the usability of smaller training fields.
Therefore, satellite images with higher resolution (SPOT, LANDSATTM 6 with 15 plot 15 m2) should be available as soon as possible; at the same time, it should be possible to check whether additional statistical and / or meteorological parameters are sufficiently favourable.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry started in 1987 with the assistance of the ITA consortium, using high geometric and spectral resolution satellite data to estimate crops and crop yields, complemented by sample data from land use surveys to 4 500 hectares.
A first attempt to combine this survey with satellite data took place in 1981 with an image of Landsat MSS, but did not yield convincing results, due to the insufficient resolution of the sensor MSS.
It has also become apparent that land data collected by points and segments can be used for the regression assessment, provided that a satellite with a sufficient resolution is available, with SPOT being more suitable for this scope than Landsat TM.
A finer spatial resolution is necessary in order to be able to examine environmental impacts.
Different applications in different geographical areas require different resolution and accuracy in the estimation of geophysical parameters.
For example, geostationary satellites can capture an area of one-fifth of the earth's surface in 30 minutes and provide images with a resolution of 5 or 2.5 km.
Some of the problems encountered in the project are mentioned, including the difficulty of obtaining consistent multi-temporal data, the problem of developing a consistent and generally accepted classification, as well as the limits of mass storage and the resolution of other data.
PC with Pentium 100 MHz (minimum) - 16 MB RAM (minimum) - CD-ROM drive with four times the speed (minimum) - 15 MB free disk space - screen: Super VGA, 256 colors (resolution 640 480).
The quality of post-radiation studies has been improved by the development of a method for producing high-resolution microradiographs from irradiated granules.
The resolution of REM is about 20 nm, the upper limit is at least 1000 micrometers.
The main obstacle to classical image remote speech is bandwidth: With conventional telephone lines it is still difficult to transmit a good resolution with a sufficiently high repetition frequency to give the impression of movement.
The image transducer developed by IMEC provides a better resolution in the middle of the image (according to the Fovea) than at its edge (retina), using a very limited number (8013) at pixels.
The EISS browser enables images to be found and viewed at low resolution.

The core of the project is "MGW," a "smart media streaming server," which allows content to be distributed on separate networks where the audio / video bit rate, resolution and format are changed.
The Space Apphcations Institute, which is part of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), has published a report that sets out a new methodology for mapping Europe's forests using an advanced high-resolution radiometer.
The unit is based on the application of a supra-spectral sensor with a suitable spatial resolution, which is potentially supplemented by an infrared sensor with a lower resolution;
This will be the first time that such a "snapshot" of the planet Earth has been compiled in terms of resolution and coverage.
The topics covered by the projects presented were: Ways of supporting Altimetri on climate forecasting, monitoring of marine pollution, use of Earth observation to evaluate the health of European forests, the ozone map map, whose objective is to update a "
The data should be obtained on the basis of the output of meteorological models and low-resolution satellite data.
The third batch involves the management of a small-resolution processing chain for satellite data.
Operation of MARS de data includes data derived from a global circulatory model, low-resolution satellite data and derived products; mapping and delivery of the results; updating of the corresponding MARS database.
Siemens dealt with data quality, because solid models require a much higher resolution and accuracy than normal scans.
Finally, the École Nationale Supérieure de Physique de Strasbourg (ENSPS) has commissioned the development of a high-speed memory card, which can store 2000 images with full resolution of 512 games 512 pixels.
The resolution of this vectorial equation by the coordinate directions leads to the acceleration that occurs in x, y and z directions.
An excerpt from a measurement is reproduced in picture 43, where two times the signal frequency is recorded, once with high resolution.
One advantage of the empirical over the teoretic identification of categories is that it is possible to establish their general applicability and reliability in the resolution of ambiguity in real texts.
The resolution takes place in the original language; if it is translated into several languages at the same time, individual meanings can only be entered into these programs at certain points.
This could lead to an increase in the resolution of the ultrasound test.
For reasons of higher accuracy (greater resolution) at the simulation at the hybrid computer and the uniform standardization of the entire road for arbitrary run-off plans, the coefficients of the linear rolling road model were calculated for setpoint deviation.
Full volume sampling with a high-resolution radar (like the one in Chilbolton) would take too long.
Of these data, the low resolution (10 s) were used only to investigate long walls (larger than 32 s), while those were used with the high resolution to describe the process as a whole.
The shortcomings there, such as insufficient resolution and too long response times, are currently a major obstacle to the inclusion of certain information relevant to innovation in databases.
The IRSID (47) research project uses a new generation of X-ray radiation detectors with a photodiode line, which allows the simultaneous acquisition of a large number of measurement points with the same accuracy, but with a more fine resolution.
However, the use of the new resolution has the advantage that the differences in surface temperature over the length of the absorbed absorber can now be recognized.
The resolution of this model of price flexibility is achieved by balancing supply and demand.
The break-up of the model leads us to set three marginal quotas.
The improvement of non-destructive methods with high spatial and temporal resolution, which characterize e.g. bioactive interfaces (structure, function, stability) and the design of miniaturized converters for devices based on biological function.

Using low resolution (1 km) footage from the NOAA (National Océanography and UNK eric Administration) American weather observation satellites, the JRC has developed a map of all Earth's tropical forests.
This inventory was only possible due to several technological developments in the field of radar wave probes (microwave probes) with a low spatial resolution.
The aim is to follow the development of tropical forests almost simultaneously by using images at both low and high resolution.
The high resolution images allow the region to be analysed in detail and to determine the size of the forest areas.
A new type Sonar • A new generation of sonars has been developed in the field of marine technology and within the framework of the ACID (Acoustic Imaging Development) project.

By scanning documents, the contents of paper pages can be saved as a computer file containing an image of the original document with a certain resolution.
The resolution of a scanner is expressed in dots per inch (dpi).
Color scanners can easily reach a resolution of 300 or 600 dpi.
The resolution of a fax scanner is much lower (100 to 200 dpi).
Because of the low resolution and poor print quality, optical character recognition for faxes is often difficult to use.

It called on governments in the region to commit to sustainable land use and sustainable investments that will not be at the expense of South East Asia's natural resources, mainly forests.
Some investors seem to be relying on safe assets, such as gold.
On average, investors in Europe hold more than 34% of short-term investments, compared to 14% in the US.
For this, short-term investments in Europe are more than twice as heavily weighted.
It is particularly important for small countries such as Switzerland, where the possibilities of distributing assets and selecting securities are limited due to the size of the domestic capital market, that securities are issued abroad.
In recent years, the economy has benefited greatly from global demand for US assets, especially debt in the form of securities that financed a large current-account deficit.
The whole financial universe - assets and trade - has been more and more covered for 100 years than hardly any other financial market:
In the past, sustainable investment was primarily about filtering out assets in "badly-respected" industries, such as alcohol, weapons, and tobacco.
Such investments as holdings or cash reserves form the asset side.
What is the currency risk - should investments be secured?
We therefore assume that the risk-return ratio of investments in the emerging markets will improve in the future.
The plant guru Jim Rogers once said that, with an investment in the emerging markets, it would be best to buy what the emerging economies themselves buy, namely raw materials.
A New Age of Sustainable Investment
Initial approaches only excluded installations in "scapegoats" sectors, such as alcohol, weapons, or tobacco.
At Credit Suisse, we define sustainable investment as the explicit recognition that environmental, social, and governance factors can influence the ability of companies to generate long-term returns.
Our research methodology for sustainable investments begins with an analysis of sustainability opportunities and risks that can fundamentally influence a company's ability to ensure its profitability.
Why do sustainable plants and sustainably managed companies now receive so much more public attention than they did ten years ago?
As a result of disasters such as Fukushima or Deepwater Horizon, investors are asking how their investments affect the environment and society.
The market turbulence of recent times has also increased awareness of sustainable investments.
Do you assume that the trend towards sustainable investments will remain confined to purely niche areas such as environmental technology, or will investors "consideration of ESG criteria become a sustainable trend worldwide?
We want to offer investors our know-how in the field of sustainable investments, play a visible and important role in this and at the same time participate in the continuous growth in this area.
In the case of investment and banking products, the consulting process, the instruments we offer and, most importantly, our employees, "Pauli adds.
"Yields are important, no question," Pauli explains, "but good advice, including a clear justification that speaks for or against an investment, is just as important."
"Investing has become a very complex issue," says Nicole Pauli, "and from a certain point, product specialists need to have specific, detailed knowledge about a facility."
For example, the specialists in asset management for assets in funds and alternative investments, or the investment bankers for strategic choices such as a stock exchange or a merger, and finally the private banking consultants for the management of private assets.
For example, Value Investing goes to Benjamin Graham and David Dodd and their UNK werk "Security Analysis," published in 1934.
Speaking to John Maynard Keynes, supporters of the Contrarian Strategy argue that "a basic principle of investment is to oppose prevailing opinion, because if everyone agrees on the merits of an investment, it is necessarily too expensive."
On the one hand, the increase in risk aversion, given the debt problems in Greece and Spain, would argue for a flight to safe assets.
On the other hand, from a foreign investor's point of view, an investment in CHF would represent a diversification in the portfolio.
Moreover, the market for indexed products is relatively illiquid, forcing investors from passively managed mandates in investments to a level of profitability that we believe is unsustainable.
The true dimension was evident when the Bank's earnings were published for the third quarter of 2011: The new Basel III rules would have driven risk-weighted equity (Risk Weighed Assets or RWA) in investment banking to more than double.
The lack of investment alternatives and the worldwide high level of liquidity in investors "deposits also speak for an investment in stocks.
You make a decision (buy an investment) and hope for a positive effect (if you want to get a return).
It is a measure for the reliability of a plant around its mean value.
Instruments with a very low risk, such as most money-market assets, will receive a five-fold set of very risky assets, such as options.
This is particularly important in view of the currently very unusual market environment for fixed income assets, which is characterised by exceptionally low returns and a lack of safe assets.
For investors who want to share the potential of stock markets but are not willing to bear all the risks involved, a convertible bond investment is available.
Many company founders are also looking for opportunities to convert part of their assets tied to the company into liquid assets and to diversify them into uninsured and uncorrelated assets.
Long-term investments in the oil, mining, manufacturing, and transport sectors are more stable than those in stocks and bonds that are currently being withdrawn from other emerging economies.
Responsible installations offer new opportunities
For example, the first comprehensive 2013 investment report from seven regions around the world of the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance (GSIA) states that at least $13.6 trillion of professionally managed assets are now applied to the selection and management of their investments.
This corresponds to about 22% of the assets under management from these regions and shows that, overall, sustainable investments have reached a critical mass in the regions examined.
The final panel discussion focused on the central theme "Impact Investing," i.e. investments that, in addition to their financial return, also bring about social and / or environmental improvements thanks to sustained company growth.
Referring to the collapse of the Rana factory building in Bangladesh in April 2013, which claimed more than 1100 deaths among the seedlings and naps employed there and about 1000 serious injuries, Oliver Niedermaier explained that individuNet's long-term investors were particularly attracted by sovereign wealth funds.
Responsible Investment (RI) or responsible investment is an investment approach that takes account of environmental, social and governance aspects ("Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations") in the choice and management of investments.
We have been able to raise funds quickly, especially for alternative investments, and we now need to industrialise all processes - from marketing to distribution.
Apropos Growth in Alternative Equipment: What is the reason for this demand?
In my opinion, AM, with its first-class products in the field of alternative and traditional equipment and its strong multi-asset class solutions business, fulfils these requirements.
How do you ensure a sound investment and risk management process?
What does this mean in relation to installations?
The new, handpicked investment topics and ideas from Credit Suisse's Investment Strategy & Research team have been developed to help you get the most out of your investment in the second half of 2014.
Giles Keating, Head of Research, explains the thoughts behind the ideas and the effects of the plant.
"For example, European customers like to delegate their assets and often opt for asset management mandates.
The third factor could play a role, even though we do not have explicit government targets for installations.
Life insurance, such as pension funds, which have traditionally built heavily on fixed-income assets, are facing problems.
Given their risk profile and also because of the investment policies (BVG), these investors will find it difficult to increase their share of riskier assets, such as shares or high-interest bonds.
As a result, market participants liquidate their emerging markets assets.
Stock exchanges are now owned by shareholders who expect a reasonable return on investment.
The boom in 2001 was triggered by too little real-estate supply, significant employment growth, expansionary monetary policy, and households "tendency to shift their assets from equity to residential real estate.
In addition to traditional direct investment, there are a whole range of alternatives to avoid the possible disadvantages of such an investment, such as low liquidity and a lack of transparency.
To put it simply, I decide whether we invest more in bonds, equities, cash or alternative assets, as well as in the allocation of various sub-asset categories such as loans, straw funds or private equity, such as regions, countries and styles.
Today, it offers a number of possibilities to cover the megatrends of "demographics," "multipolar world" and "sustainability" with a single plant.
That would then be the right environment to deal intensively with installations that take account of these megatrends.
Indeed, the facility has achieved high returns in countries with weaker economic growth in the past.
The main investment theme for an investment in India is consumption, i.e. investment in non-cyclical consumer goods, personal care products, electronic products, upscale goods such as cars and mobile phones or luxury goods.
For each profile, the bands in which bonds, shares, alternatives and currencies are allowed to move are fixed.
American data provide an approximate idea of the potential returns on agricultural land.
Agricultural land installations would have been a good admixture for most deposits over the last two decades.
Only the right harvest year makes a noble wine a good plant.
The report also provides valuable data for the important top-down analysis of assets and puts current market concerns about government debt in the right context: It shows that the estimated $42 trillion of global government debt in 2009 is just one-fifth.
At the same time, they open up interesting opportunities for installations in companies that benefit from this development.
Danish entrepreneur and venture capital Morten Lund learned this at first hand when a position of his portfolio with over 80 assets - the best known of which was the Internet telephony and video software Skype - became worthless in 2009 and brought him all the wealth.
The development of exclusive offers has led to new structured products, tailor-made investments and new investment funds, such as a $750 million credit fund.
We can support customers in all areas, from pure wealth creation to the stage in which they need complex solutions for investment and investment issues. "
"Our biggest competitors have been passive installations in recent years," explains Küffer.
He was involved in two companies and had made some of his investments money through a listing of both companies.
"It has already happened that we have advised an internationally listed company on mergers and capital markets and, at the same time, offered personal investment or financial advice to the family holding company," says Fleuriot.
In general, therefore, it is right to say that, with the right advice and care, it is not necessarily more risky for use in spot-finding facilities than for traditional installations.
Alternative investments therefore remain an important part of any allocation of capital.
Unlike in the 1990 "s, the minimum interest rate can no longer be achieved with an almost risk-free investment such as Swiss federal bonds.
However, the investment of coupons and the repayment amounts of bonds at higher interest rates compensates for the loss of market value in the long term.
However, in times of negative real interest rates, it cannot be regarded as an adequate medium-term and long-term investment, as the investor has to accept a real loss of wealth.
Swiss banks could therefore enter into interesting new business areas by expanding their product and service offerings in the areas of philanthropy, microfinance, sustainable investments and impact investment.
Against the background of latent and difficult to predict structural inflationary pressures, however, we are already increasingly relying on real investments.
Real investments are a cornerstone of our investment strategy.
The economic progress, the generous liquidity supply of central banks, the continued favourable or adequate valuation of risk-rich assets, and the ongoing pressure on investment, should further shift the financial-market pendulum towards opportunities.
In the case of alternative plants, too, it is important once again to put together the right mix of these heterogeneous plants.
In contrast to the euro or the dollar, even with risk-free investments in Swiss francs, there is still a positive return on investment.
Should the Member States be offered a menu with only one meal or an à la carte meal?
Personally, I believe that the invention of à la carte food, in comparison with the menu, represented a great step forward for civilisation, with only one court that corresponded to the customs of barracks.
"We merely point out how meals that make fat can be replaced by calorie-poor, yet tasty dishes."
In addition, some dishes are complete meals, while others consist exclusively of vegetables.
The protein / energy ratio (7 g per 100 kcal) recommended for dishes prepared only with meat is higher than the value of an additional half of beef (5 g per 100 kcal), but is much lower than that for poultry.
Fruit juices (with or without added sugar), nectar (diluted fruit juice, usually with sugar additive) and dishes consisting exclusively of fruit have long been part of the diet of sweetening throughout Europe.
The committee's recommendations suggest a slight increase in the natural carbohydrate content (up to a total value of 15 g per 100 ml in fruit and nectar and up to 20 g per 100 g in a dish consisting of only fruit).
Changes in eating habits were also due to the explosion in travel, mobility, the emergence of restaurants, among others, offering foreign dishes, and the increasing popularity of foreign food.
Paella The dish comes from the Spanish rice-growing area on the Mediterranean coast, the region of Valencia.
A few days later, when the same court was brought before him, he used his detector to detect ionising radiation at that time something completely new and immensely impressive and found that the food was radioactive.
He gave a little of a radioactive substance to the leftovers of food on his plate, and when the same dish was returned to him, he used his radiation detector and found that food was radioactive.
We also have gluten-free alternatives and dishes for allergy sufferers. "
Consequently, there is a great need for ready meals, which has led to the development of new food products and packaging, such as TV-Dinner and pre-cooked dishes, which are ready to eat or only have to be heated in microwave.
Examples of products for which these materials are already used are storage dishes, snacks such as potato chips and peanuts and also the ultra-light brick-shaped vacuum packaging for coffee.
Within a generation our varied food has become richer and more varied - we eat food and food from all over Europe and the world.
In each school, the best dishes were awarded and these recipes were published in the magazine "Ha Kuriren."
She learned how to prepare Italian dishes and, in particular, desserts with fresh local ingredients.
If you want to travel in this way, you have to find these wonderful places, be sure to have a good reception and try authentic regional dishes.
Guests were able to enjoy traditional Finnish dishes based on reindeer, salmon and caviar, as well as Finnish beers.
Organised under the auspices of the President and the Secretary-General of the EESC and in cooperation with Hervé COUPEAU (Group III - Various Interests), representatives of the young farmers of France and of the French overseas departments, Corsica.
If you add a bit of flexibility and freedom so that a group of courts can exchange one another, you may even achieve an even higher level of satisfaction.
Max UNK works as a volunteer
They work in several places in their voluntary year.
Where else?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I have also worked at the school in the open whole day.
What are your experiences with this?
Lot: It is a beautiful, broad spectrum that I see here.
I have to deal with different people, young people, refugees and young adults.
They are now 26 years old, a late-working volunteer.
How does this come about?
Lot: I have made my UNK.
And then a civil engineering study, let's say, successfully aborted.
I realized for me that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else, work with people.
And then I asked myself what you are doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it is really on the spot, in the focus point, too.
And was it?
Lot: I have collected some great impressions.
I will start my studies in social affairs in the winter semester.
I am going to study dual, probably doing a social worker training at the Youth Welfare Office Herne and studying in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Is it not a bit unusual to have several different locations during the voluntary service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It's always important where to do your FSJ.
It can be done from retirement to youth work - in all kinds of facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also partly in the OGS, in other words in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly what irritated me.
I was able to see my own strengths and see how it really works.
Unlike in civil engineering studies?
Lot: Well, this is not a matter of counting static.
There are always other people in front of their heads who have a different history.
Whether a refugee, a young person who has been taken out of the family, is something that must always be dealt with individually.
Very interesting.
And you did not have any fears of contact?
Quantity: For this I am not the type.
It is an area that has a lot to offer.
A lot of love, a lot of friendliness.
There are sometimes negative moments, but that is how life is.
But planning the invasion of Iraq, in which Rumsfeld advocated the use of fewer troops than he proposed, suggests an inadequate understanding of distributed systems.
Those who wanted to restrict the use of the worshippers seem to fear, in some cases, a risk to state security.
Almost €3 billion has been cut in the budget for various forms of compensation for victims of communism and crime, or for court appeals, even for building savings.
The local authorities were unable to confirm the victims "identity, but two representatives of the US counter-terrorism have provided unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
The first two victims were seriously injured in the hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded the lifting of the criminal proceedings.

Mario Monti, the incoming Italian leader, has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that "sacrifices" to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last few months of Berlusconi's government.
If France decides to phase out nuclear power, a large part of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and the annual EUR 6 billion in capital goods and nuclear energy exports would contract more and more.
For my group, it is particularly positive to see that the development initiated by the rejection of the budget by this House has now been transformed into an initial resolution of the problems.
However, forces that are breaking up are repeatedly being felt, even though EuroPilot, the organisation of European pilots, is also saying that Eurocontrol is the solution to European air traffic control.
The resolution of the Committee on Transport draws attention to the urgent case of Eurocontrol and calls for its resolution to be avoided or at least for its specific, albeit limited, function to be maintained.
How did the Commission assess the recent dissolution of political parties in Turkey by the military junta?
Europe is changing in our eyes, but, and this should be emphasised, with the result of the disintegration and destruction not only of space but also of the family, culture and society: This is the Europe of equals, not the Europe of peoples.
I believe it is essential to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons as a result of the break-up of the former Soviet Union.
The question that arises, however, is whether the separation, the dissolution will put an end to the conflict, or whether it will continue in view of the new geopolitical connections that are now being forged, which are unlikely to allow peaceful life in the Balkans.
The dangers of the proliferation of technology and technical know-how for the production of weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, chemical, biological) have increased significantly after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
Their despair is the result of the break-up of Yugoslavia and the failure of the leaders responsible to agree on how the peoples of former Yugoslavia should live together.
It is also uncharted if it is said that other institutions could be dissolved in accordance with the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact.
Basically, you are asking the Community the question: Deepening the federal state or dismantling a free trade area?
Unfortunately, however, the developments so far following the collapse of the socialist camp and the dissolution of the USSR, the statements by the representatives of NATO and America, the blatant attacks or interventions against independent states demonstrate the importance of the nature and objectives of any conversion.
But this is no wonder: No country in the world, not even the richest and most developed Western country, could have withstood the sudden drop in its own trade by 85%, as happened in Cuba with the dissolution of the COMECON.
His dissolution of Parliament, dismissal of judges and provisional suspension of the Constitution, his detention of a large number of people and, of course, his ban on the free press - much of this is not only questionable when it comes to democracy, but directly illegal.

There is no doubt that the dissolution of a number of African states, including Somalia, Liberia and Burundi, which Hen Pons Grau mentioned in his report, together with the social and economic destabilization that led to the end of civil wars.
Firstly, because we must not confuse the 'integration' of the Member States into the Community or the Union with their 'disintegration' in the same.
Perhaps things could have taken a different course from the precipitous disintegration of Yugoslavia; many sides, including the European Community, share responsibility for the fact that the present situation has been perpetuated - the purge of homogenization, war.
After the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, these countries are seeking the path to democracy and a social market economy.
Following the political events following this signature, in particular the dissolution of the Kazakh Parliament by President Nazarbaiev, our Parliament felt compelled to suspend the ratification procedure for this agreement until parliamentary elections were held.
There are disturbing reports of human experiments carried out in Ukraine after the Soviet Union was dissolved.
Europe cannot be strengthened by its disintegration.
These include the immediate dismantling of military and civil repression, the prosecution of paramilitaries, an end to impunity and compensation for victims.
The Commission endorses the conclusions of the Vienna Summit which provide for the disarmament and disbanding of these militias and the deployment of a United Nations mission to reduce tensions.
One thing I would like to highlight in this debate is that today we are witnessing the disintegration and destruction of Kosovo and of an entire people.
The recent municipal and regional elections have been declared invalid, and the military has taken over legislative and executive power following the dissolution of the National Assembly.
The standard of living of their people has steadily fallen, the insecurity and influence of various mafias have increased alarmingly, and the state is on the road to disintegration.
This includes the free repair, replacement service, a reduction in the purchase price or the termination of the contract in the event of defective goods.
- the EU recognised the new states resulting from the dissolution of the Soviet Union (the Baltic States in September 1991), Yugoslavia (Slovenia and Croatia in January 1992, Bosnia-Herzegovina in April 1992 and Macedonia in 1995);
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, it restructured its relations with the parliaments of the new countries and formed four separate delegations: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, with the three Transcaucasian republics and with Central Asian republics (including Mongolia).

The PCA with the countries of the South Caucasus are similar to the agreements with Eastern European and Central Asian countries concluded in 1991 in connection with the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
The maintenance and consolidation of parliamentary democracy was therefore always the basic theme of the EZPWD's work in the 1980 "s, which increased in importance after the disintegration of the communist regime and the dissolution of the Eastern bloc in 1989 (correspondence).
With the fall of the Communist regime and the break-up of the Central and Eastern European Bloch since 1989, parliamentary democracy in Europe has entered a new ara.

Liquidation; termination of a company which precedes or follows the liquidation of the company, i.e. the sale of its assets, the satisfaction of creditors and the distribution of the remaining assets among the shareholders.
The object of this analysis is to move the "seat" of a company without resolution, as it is called in the task.
The addition of "without resolution" makes it clear that these are the rules of private international law, which determine which law is applicable to a company and whether a company is to be regarded as a legal person.
The present study is limited to the question of whether Member States' rules on company law and private international law should be harmonised in such a way as to enable companies to transfer their actual seat without dissolution to another Member State.
(1) the law applicable to a company; (2) the amendment of the law which governs a company; (3) the possibility of transferring the administrative seat of a company without dissolution from the founding state to the administrative seat of the company;
This requires the dissolution of the company in the exit state and the re-establishment in the state of destination.
However, the case-law does not allow all Member States applying the theory of seat to allow a company to have its administrative seat in another Member State without dissolution.
In some Member States, this would lead to the disbanding of society:
In all Member States, a company may transfer the administrative seat within the jurisdiction of the State concerned without dissolution.
(1) Companies should be able to transfer their registered office, i.e. their actual seat, to another Member State without dissolution.
(2) On the basis of the freedom of establishment, companies are entitled to transfer their actual seat without dissolution (subject to the rules applicable in the Member States for reasons of transport protection).
This represents a step backwards for those Member States that apply the theory of seating and allow seating to be laid down without dissolution.
The State of exit may only delete these registration authorisations on the basis of proof of the dissolution of the company in accordance with the legislation of a Member State which is the company's guiding principle.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, and they therefore pay more government and local taxes, according to the latest study.

Pearson cuts a further 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revive the business
The UK educational group Pearson said on Friday that it would cut a further 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72%, as another restructuring programme would be launched to overcome the pressure that the company is facing.
The redundancies, which Director-General John Fallon announced for the most part for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, are in addition to his previous restructuring, which has already lost 4,000 jobs.
Pearson announced a third cost-cutting plan in May to cut costs by another £300 million ($394 million) to revive a business that was hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after an increase of 1 percent to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Convoy attack from Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and injured several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and one interpreter were injured, announced a statement by NATO.

On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.

Correspondents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies, and, in particular, in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.

"I went up for Broner [to £140], but I'm not so big.
I am small for 140.

Fortunas Hoffmann: "Triple chain works better"
After 2: 2, Andre Hoffmann hopes to mark the start of the season against Braunschweig, that the optimisation of the defence formation will bring points to Aue.
With the first season game Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result would not have been the two opposite at the 2: 2 against Braunschweig.
"These were two counter-sides too much, and we need to be even more careful in Aue," says Fortuna Düsseldorf's defense player.
In the Ore Mountains, the three chain is also to be further optimized.
And a gate after a free kick-off is no longer intended to catch up.
"For the future, it will be the case that no one will take the line alongside Michael (Rensing)."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be able to cope better with the tricycle even after the experience gained in the preparation process than with the four-fold chain.
"I still do not know how we will act in Aue," says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we just said in the trierkette Hoffmann on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and.
"It is a prerequisite, but that we should be even more harmonious and that we should not afford so many playing errors in the structure."
Of course Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"But whether you can talk about a failed start after an undecided decision does not know.
The performance might well be okay, "said Hoffmann.
"If, however, we are able to find four points on Sunday and focus on poker, we will certainly be able to speak of a regular season start."
His trainer didn't want to know about this.
"I judge the start of the season only after six to eight days of playing," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim was aborted prematurely.
"Now they can start the season almost with a home game," Funkel and Hoffmann said that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher, as they don't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a career favorite.
"But they do not know where they are at present 100%," says the defenders of Fortuna.
It is true that the guests from the Rhineland, as a light favourite on Sunday, will meet in the stadium of Aue, which is finally (almost) finished.
"The fact that we sweep them away just because we are entitled to be among the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose balance sheet is positive in only losing Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the 2 Bundesliga that you have to beat from the outset," says Fortunas Chief coach.
"Making such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And so Funkel doesn't want to see his players on Sunday.

New results of the Swedish Asylum Age Assessment Test published
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80% of the people tested are over 18 years old, but not everyone believes in the accuracy.
The Swedish Forensian Medicine Authority (UNK tsmedicUNK verket) started the tests last year.
During the asylum procedure, they are intended to clarify the assessment of age after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migration Management Board) was criticised for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
So far, Migration verket has sent out 6,880 cases to be tested, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18 years old."
The tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent in recent months.
"We see no big difference in statistics of recent months, the numbers are fairly constant," he said to the magazine The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged to be over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied over his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases "proposing that the person examined be 18 years or older."
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet looked at the 581 results published, it found that, in 243 of these cases, the person had frankly said that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI shots of knee joints are made, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.

Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we cannot say it safely, we should not act as if we could, "he said to the newspaper Metro.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of a child as an adult being wrongly judged is low.
The greatest risk is when the person is just under 18, in this case about 10%. "

Fully in the Plan
Work on the three bridges of road 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete section was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good at the time, it is running super," says Reinhold Leicht, head of construction at the Department of Road and Transport in the Regional Bureau of Freiburg.
In April, the works began simultaneously on all three bridges in need of renovation between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The end of the building is scheduled for October and it is a pity that the timetable will be adhered to.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, will take you over the Trombach.
It is a concrete vaulted bridge covered with red bunker stone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has come into the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings will now be thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red bunker stone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10,60 metres long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday morning on the northern side has now received a 1.30 m width and seven tons of so-called bridge cap.
This is a border fortification which is also used as an operating route.
On the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 meter wide bridge cap will be used on Friday.
Then the pedestrian path is to be followed.
The special feature is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
The construction of the building in Lauterbach requires a special touch of sensitivity.
There is also a fibre optic cable to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed of the project in advance of the works by hand papers.
In addition, fish and crustaceans had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the building building of the building and the assembly yard in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by a traffic light.
For construction work at the bridge at the Lauterbacher UNK entrance, the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "UNK Linden" is completely closed.
The cost of the three renovation operations amounts to a total of EUR 700 000.
It is financed by the country.

AFD in Gerolstein: Bunter UNK bei UNK elsalat

The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, and they are also present at the train station, which is only a few metres away from the venues.
How did the AfD actually come on Gerolstein?

The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked for in Daun, but received a cancellation there, because due to the already built Laurentiuskirmes there were not enough parking spaces.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a nice event here."
Looking at the event at Rondellvorplatz, he says: "This is the good right of people, the main thing, it remains peaceful."
This is also the case: Around 20 o'clock a band provides entertainment on the Rondellvorplatz, in the Stadthalle several speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe UNK.
There are about 200 listeners in the Chamber who are waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and Deputy Federal President Beatrix of Storch to make their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials have had a quiet evening.
The AfD event takes a little more than an hour, the guests on the first floor have a longer breath, but there is also a need to clean up shortly after 9 pm.
The police can stop - no special incidents.

West Virginia Governor announces that he will change the party
. The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced in a rally with President Trump on Thursday evening that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the democrats have moved away from me, "said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and much reflection... today, as a resident of West Virginia, I will tell you that I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor."
The rally broke out in jubilation.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
"As a trainer, I would say that it is time to play another game."
Mr. Trump promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally.

It is worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, on Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee issued a statement saying: "The party change of Governor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us rather than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governors and control of the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement by Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive, unifying message to RNC.

Coe praises "honest" Russian apology for doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, the world leader in athletics, praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious apology from Russia for a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be re-introduced into sport.
Russia's athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships in athletics that his country's exile from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight it.
He said he is sorry for "all athletes who have been picked up gold and silver medals in competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015, after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to reporters.
"The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation itself recognized that it had experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is reorganised."
Coe said that he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been made, but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the time to re-establish Russia," Coe said.
"We need to do everything we can in the coming months to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the degraded system, "he added.

Mourning ceremony for soldiers who have fallen down in Mali
At a funeral in Fritzlar in northern Hessen, around 1000 people thought of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Domstadt under high security conditions.
On the outstanding issue of the crash, Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
However, she described the two successful pilots as "experts of their profession."
"We bow to the highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old North Hessen Staff Captain died on Wednesday a week ago in West African Mali.
Her coffins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday she was taken to the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter by the Bundeswehr's death guard.
At noon, only the relatives in the church took farewell.
After that, the funeral began in the circle of the family, the closest friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politicians.
Hessens Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the General Inspectorate of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker were among them.
Guests of mourning laid down roses, the relatives stood arm by the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Defense Minister of the Leyen called the ousted soldiers "highly decorated" and invaded.
The UNK ptmann was one of the first six Tiger Tiger Tiger Tiger pilots trained in his administration.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also said: "If this crew could not turn its back on the crash, no one would have been able to do so."
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not emerge from Minister von Leyen: The mission was dangerous.
But it is also of great importance "for a country from which we are separated only by two states," she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were taken out of the cathedral.
When and where they are provided, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information about this.
In accordance with the Fair Value Model of Credit Suisse, the Swiss franc on the Euro is still undervalued, even though it has revalued from a franc euro rate of over 1.60 to around 1.50 since 2007.
The stock markets of developed countries are assessed at a price-profit ratio of 17 compared to a GM of ten for emerging stock markets.
Value investors focus on the "price" of the price / earnings ratio, while Growth investors are more interested in the "profit" element of that ratio.
Thus, Contrarian investors choose companies that are undervalued and have negative price momentum.
Finally, the Euro franc rate remains a subject:
The more and more often, for example, the price of a share oscillates, the greater the fluctuation range and the more risky the capital investment is.
"The decision of the Swiss National Bank to set the rate at 1.20 was crucial for the rapid recovery of growth," Melli recalls.
If you look at the price of gold for a longer period of time, you have to say that the yellow metal is not exactly cheap at its present rate.
Companies "profits and earnings dynamics are recovering from a low level, and valuations such as the price-earnings ratio are also beginning to increase in anticipation of rising profits.
In 2010, Geithner drew the attention of the media and the Chinese authorities when he complained at the WEF about the yuan's price.
If rapid appreciation of China's currency is potentially dangerous to the global economy, why is the White House so fixated on the yuan's price?
"Although the price / earnings ratio is currently in the range of values recorded in 2007, we do not expect a significant correction at the moment.
Macroeconomic aspects and company profits will not be one of the main driving factors, which is why we expect to see an expansion of the price-earnings ratio in 2013.
Shirakawa predicts inflation of just 0.6% in 2014, well below the BoJ's 2% target, and may require the central bank to further weaken the yen rate to meet its inflation target.
The highest returns seem to be achieved when dividend yields are high and price / profit ratio (FGM) is low.
Higher return on equity, higher price ratio and higher pay-out ratio, "says Stefano Natella, Head of Global Equity Research in Credit Suisse's Investment Banking Division.
There are higher price-book-value ratios.
The PEG ratio (price / profit ratio divided by profit growth) of most large and almost all medium-sized enterprises is still quite favourable compared to other emerging economies.
The strengthening of the Frankish economy reduced the dollar's exchange rate from around CHF 4.30 to a little more than CHF 2 within a few years.
Moreover, the valuations of the future price-earnings ratio appear attractive, as most companies "stocks are down at the bottom of their historical margin.
Finally, the costs for local companies are rising less than those for their competitors abroad, while the exchange ratio with the euro remains constant at a rate of around CHF 1,20.
The basic idea behind convertible bonds is that they will be converted into shares when the company's price falls below a certain value.
When the franc-euro exchange rate was at 1.60, this offset much larger margins than now, when the exchange rate is at 1.22.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio where money is used to bet on food prices," Bode said.
As a result, just 11% consider it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer facilities that are wagered on food prices.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they were told that their bank was involved in such transactions: One in two would announce all the installations where money was flowing into commodity speculation.

Prince Henrik does not want a grave next to his wife
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
That was what the Royal House announced on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish Königspaar is buried in the Domkirche of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already produced a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with the decision of her husband, as stated in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik is buried is still unclear.
However, he does not intend to be buried in his home country in France.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title
After joining his wife in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016, he retired, also earning the title "PrinzUNK hl."
Since Henrik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted, he did not consider himself equal to his wife - even after death, Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman of the Danish Royal House, explained.
Where the last 83-year-olds' resting place will ultimately be, is not yet clear.
However, he does not intend to be buried in his home country in France, but in Denmark.
He likes the country for which he has worked over the last 50 years.
In 1965, the son of a French noble family, Henri de Laborde de de Monpezat, was born in London.
He worked at the Thames in the French Embassy.
During his later wife, Prince Henrik had a difficult stand with the Danes in his nearly 50-year reign.
In a autobiography, Henrik said for the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticised.
My Danish was pregnant, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitting socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, which I smothered in place of Virginia tobacco and which in my country had the reputation of being the brand of society-critical intellectuals, I could not hope for indulgence.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed.
These were two errors! "

Prime Minister Weil calls for rapid re-election
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
After losing the red-green majority of the government, Lower Saxony's prime minister, Stephan Weil (SPD), is in favour of a rapid re-election of the country day, but he does not want to resign.
Because, on Friday, we were in favour of the dissolution of Parliament.
Prior to this, the surprising departure of a Green MEP from her regional group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the official election date, the red-green coalition in Hannover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and the FDP.
The former Green MEP Elke TUNK justified her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (UNK mme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained on Friday in Hannover.
CDU Chairman Björn Thümler wants to recommend his group to accept them.
The CDU and the FDP together would have 69 seats in Lower Saxony's Landtag, the SPD and the Green Party 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new country day will be elected regularly on 14 January next year.
Thümler said that the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to govern in this situation without a majority.
However, Stephan Weil considers it essential that the country's day should decide on its own resolution as soon as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on how to proceed on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility that the country day will deprive the Prime Minister of confidence and elect a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be examined in a legally correct manner, "Thümler said.
"We will be able to discuss all the issues calmly when they have been looked at in a legally reasonable way."
Thümler called TweUNK Step "but something strange."
The politician himself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good. "
She referred to herself as a follower of black-green.
The Greens called for the breakaway MPs to return their country-day mandate.
"We assume, of course, that they will give back their country day mandate, which they have received through the green country list, with immediate effect," announced state leaders Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The Chairman of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance, Anja Piel, said: 'We very much regret the decision of Elke TUNK'.
She has deliberately chosen not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even in the light of the fact that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step."
The Social Democratic Party's candidate, Martin Schulz, condemns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Green MEP Elke TUNK to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of voters, but also a betrayal of the Red-Green," wrote the Federal Social Democrat Chief on Facebook on Friday.
He supported the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to re-elect the country's day quickly.
The exit tweUNK costs red-green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician says "in her wounded vanity and in her frustration her personal interests ahead of the country's well-being," criticized SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is playing this dirty intrigue game and trying to capitalize on it."
Niedersachsens CDU Chairman Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his members that Elke TUNK be admitted to the CDU.
Thomas Oppermann, the leader of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), accused TUNK of distorting the result of the 2013 rural election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was the strongest party before the SPD, but the Social Democratic Party and the Green Party had a razor-thin majority of one vote in the country's parliament.

Agriculture Minister interview - How do we protect ourselves from gifteiern, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves.
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in interview with the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can the consumer protect himself from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to take a close look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print.
On the consumer protection portal www.UNK UNK UNK ung.de, the Länder provide the latest information on the affected eggs.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we know at the moment, there is virtually no risk to health.
Does Aldi now take on the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the supply - because the central role of the reconnaissance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister for Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the Länder.
Despite this, my House has got up immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since it became known that Germany was suffering.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade, like manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are marketable and do not pose any health risks.
If eggs exceed the maximum residue limit of 0,005mg / kg, they will not be marketable.
Uncontaminated eggs can, however, be sold and consumed.
This time it is not the companies that are to blame.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to current information, production companies are not directly to blame.
On the contrary, they are liable to suffer economic damage due to the alleged illegal practices of service providers.
As always, in the event of an emergency, there are too few inspectors.
Is there only a lack of staff or of coherent competence?
It was precisely the official controls that revealed the operation.
The truth is, however, that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100%.
It is precisely for this reason that it is essential to ensure that these events are properly investigated and handed over to the public prosecutor's offices in cases where criminal offences may be committed.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the authorities responsible to provide full information.
Is the regular alarm in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and marketable food.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The money that has been adulterated has put producers, traders and consumers in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
As a matter of principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of insecticide Fipronil in the keeping of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This needs to be worked on consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to ensure that the facts are swiftly and fully investigated.
The impact of football's financial rules on Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded spending by European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar's world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
There will be some consequences for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, because the governing organisation that has monitored the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair-play rules, launched by UEFA in 2011, mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was funded without major losses.
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary of several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly make money available so that Neymar signs it and puts it into a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the Qatar ruling family, rich in energy.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on acquiring players, but they have to deal with legitimate sources of revenue that enable them to break the corner in their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had incurred huge debts in their quest for success were effectively cheating and risking to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs "debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher issue.
During the current three-year FFP programming period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of €30 million.
And, although Platini fell out of favor by the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to advocate discouraging excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traaning, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, vis-à-vis The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid the Neymar buy-out in a lump sum, it may distribute the amount for the accounts for the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, which will allow the transfer rate of EUR 44.4 million to be entered in the annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit the PSG, together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of €60 million (then $82 million), which was later reduced to €20 million - and ordered team members to remain limited to 21 for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 otherwise.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlist their financial supervision by inflating their revenues from companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a Catalan company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship were to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not consider this to be a legitimate income.
This was exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of PSA's sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could be made by the organizing committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors, and that such maneuvers for UEFA regulators could be easy to find out.
The sanctions against PSG thus far mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preliminary discussions with PSG about Neymar's transfer, and on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation were told.
They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity, as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG has achieved a profit of more than €10 million in 2015 / 16 with a turnover of €542.4 million.
The accounts for the last fiscal year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising, and tricot sales.
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after the signature.
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going, and it tried to prevent Neymar's move by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"It is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the president of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoons, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association.
"It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire football landscape over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as a country has an association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country. "

Swiss is looking for a new supplier of chocolate.
In recent years UNK at Frey has been producing aboard chocolate for Swiss.
Now the southern cooperation is coming to a possible end: The airline resigns the contract.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report from the newspaper "UNK UNK" of Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and subject to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier UNK at Frey," said the spokeswoman.
Around 17 million small rotary-white cup boards of 14 grams distribute each year the cabin crew before landing to passengers.
The Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.
Industry experts estimate the order volume according to "northwestern Switzerland" at CHF 1.5 to 2 million - the Migros subsidiary generates annual sales of around CHF 1 billion.
But the advertising effect is more important: For a chocolate manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
The Swiss does not want to reveal how many candidates there are in the new call for tenders.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, UNK at Frey wants to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer could not be contacted for an opinion.
Since 2006, Swiss chocolate panels have been distributed on board their flights.
Before Swiss entered into a contract with Migros's daughter, Barry Callebaut, in cooperation with Hug, supplied the chocolate tablets.
The opportunity to place the logo was introduced two and a half years ago with the start of the cooperation with UNK at Frey.
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers will be treated with treats from the Confiserie UNK gli, in Business Class nake passengers Schoggi from Lindt and in Economy Class Schoggi from UNK at Frey.
Swiss Schoggi is also distributed on the short run by UNK at Frey, both in Business and Economy Class.
Energy policy cannot, however, be assessed solely from an environmental point of view, since no single power plant - whatever its type - would soon be built and even stone, clay and earth would have to be inspected and all chemical industrial plants would have to accept for a long time.
In addition to clay and glass, raw materials are now used as raw materials for their production, including compartments, cardboard and plastics.
This should be done in the best possible way.

According to PRINZ / 15 /, binary soil types always consist of a mixture of clay and sip fractions with very different proportions of the larger grain fractions.
In the same climate, the content of organic substances in clay is higher than in the sip or clay.
In particular clay, but also clay, are installed as natural materials in layers with predominantly static compression at the landfill base.
The sealing of landfills with such clay sand mixtures is extremely economical and easy to control.
The secondary earth (clay) sealing layer of variant 2 consists exclusively of earth materials.
This base layer is recommended to be made from compressed earth materials (usually clay) rather than from incoming, insitu compressed soils.
The EPO offers a number of methods to calculate the power of the earth's clay layer.
The new draft directive draws attention to the fact that for this variant of the system, the previous legal requirements (60 cm thick clay with a k _ value of 1 kitchenette 109 m / s) are no longer sufficient.
In the narrow wall process, according to the respective geological conditions, the compaction of the subsoil is achieved either by fixation or pressing of sealing masses (clay cement and bentonite cement blends).
The Gradient i of the wall area is calculated from the water mirror difference and the thickness of the sealing wall, while the Gradient i is determined for the sealing horizon (sound, sip) from the water mirror difference and the binding depth.
The sound acts as a semi-permeable membrane.
However, animzone exchange capacity is increased by organic kerosene, which can be fine-distributed in clay up to 2 gew.-%.

Since 1965, the German company Eisenhütte Westfalia-Lünen has been constructing small prepress machines of the type UNK UNK, Fuchs and Dachs, which are mainly used in soft rock (clay, gypps, pyrite).
100 g of earth (fertile, non-sterile soil) is suspended in 1 000 ml of chlorine-free drinking water (soil species with a very high content of clay, sand and organic carbon are unsuitable).
The results of the studies carried out under the PAGIS project have been published in a five-volume edition: A short version (EUR 11775EN), clay (EUR 11776EN), granite (EUR 1177FR).
The clay, this formable material, which our ancestors used for a variety of purposes and which is currently used in fields as diverse as construction or the pharmaceutical industry, has shifted the attention of scientists and technicians to a reliable system of nuclear disposal.
The skin-like chemical component of the clay is an aluminium silicate, which is refractory material, so that the clay is not a good heat conductor.

The target formation, the so-called boom clay, is found in the underground of the site and has a power of more than 100 m, reaching so deep that a bearing could be set up at a depth of more than 200 m below the surface.
The boom tone has some very attractive features, such as lithological homogeneity, very low permeability and excellent retention capacity.
The boom-tone shows a sequence of alternating layers of sand and clay.
At the Mol site and in its immediate surroundings, the sand layer under boom-clay is not used for pumping groundwater because of its high content of dissolved substances and low yield.

Inactive substances are increasingly used as materials such as clay, possibly mixed with polymers, powdered fluoride or asphalt concrete, but also geotextile films such as synthetic material made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC).
When the landfill is closed, an approximately 1 m high end cover of clay and arable land is applied.
The last 50 cm of the bay is sealed with an impermeable material of concrete, bentonite or clay in order to prevent the inflow of air and, on the other hand, the escape of the landfill gas into the atmosphere.
Elements of the side-step: Calcareous clay, grey and black clay, limestone, compact grey mergel.

Nostalgia goes into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the niche.
This repetition of the story is nostalgic at the same time for the glorious days of the Amy characters of the 80 "s, for the 90-year-grunge era (as the protagonists David Wain and Michael Showalter called themselves).
As a cultural artifact, it is also a parody and a embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humors (it contained an original story for a speaking high-class vegetables, which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By climbing up to the core of the gags - actors of middle age play horny children who are grown up - they nevertheless managed to get the last part of the joke back.
"Ten Years Later," with his adults who are now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted, and his parody goes more like a scattering edge, including a riff on the stalker films of the 90 "s.
At one point, a character strolls through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a series of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovely Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy-evil plot in which Ronald Reagan (including Mr. Showalter) is involved, which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the Excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It is especially fun to see the ever-young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons of "singles," whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old boy.
It is the moments of random madness that could heat up this franchise like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" Series until he achieves what I assume to be his logical conclusion: "Wet American Summer Twenty."

The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as a director states to be a found TV series: A Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth.

It is a brilliant idea.
But it is not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on television, as Americans may do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali, and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game "Find out the Voice."
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single.
In six long episodes, the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective," which was edited for a smaller length, could deliver his Agitprop satire better, as Gregor and Iosef keep visiting the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two big hamburgers.
The message for the imagined Communist audience is that Western culture can make everything to feed for money.

Strike against drugs mafia in the country
The police have succeeded in striking a blow against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutor, Konstanz, announced on Friday.
15 accused persons aged between 25 and 77 have been arrested and arrest warrants against them have already been issued.
In addition, officials ensured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested in Italy during a simultaneous raid.
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects of Italy.
The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany.
The operation involved Italian and Bavarian investigators.
In total, more than 300 police officers were deployed.
The members of the mafia are accused of organised drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder, robbery and blackmail.
Since the summer of 2016, the Prosecutor's Office of Konstanz has been investigating drug trafficking in southern Germany.
Between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was an intense exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the large-scale operation was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning.
The investigation focused in particular on Italian nationals with close ties to the Italian mafia.
Also an incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, at which several shots were fired early in the morning into a restaurant, should go to the account of the gang.
How to complain about large gaps in the register of foreigners
"Data from citizens who should not appear": According to a report, the register of foreigners has serious shortcomings in Germany.
This leads to some serious errors in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government's Refugee Management Officer, Frank-Jürgen UNK, has drawn attention to large gaps in the immigrant central register.
Shortcomings in the data recorded there could lead to "sometimes serious wrong decisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, warned way in an analysis presented by the "Süddeutsche Zeitung."
According to the Register, 10 million people of foreign nationality are included, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data will therefore be managed by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the quality of the data had not been good in some respects.
In individual cases, data from 1921 had been found, "from people who have long since ceased to be alive, or from citizens who have become German citizens and who should no longer appear in the register."
"Incorrect data entries can significantly slow down return processes," the report states.
In addition, the statistics on people who travel outside the EU cover EU citizens who do not have to leave.
Such false attribution, however, "led to" a distorted debate on the handling of exit persons, "so it is stated in the analysis.
Meanwhile, the Federal Government appears to have started sending refugee families with children under 16 years of age back to Italy when they arrived from there.
This emerges from an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue OsnabUNK er Zeitung."
The paper therefore states that the BAMF will carry out such procedures "concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - after Italy since 1 June 2017."
This has been virtually impossible since the end of 2014, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Agreement, refugees are the responsibility of the EU State which they reach first.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that country can return him to the country of entry.
As a justification, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the absorption capacity for families with under-age children in Italy has increased substantially."
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
The internal speaker of the left-wing faction in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticised this decision: "Families with children are at risk of receiving conditions that are contrary to human rights and endangering the best interests of the child."

The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged, after weak economic growth and a weakening of inflation have dampened speculation about an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" when it maintained interest rates on family incomes in the midst of growing pressure.
The Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) leaders voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members seeking to increase this month, as weak economic growth weakened support.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, warning that the pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to close to 3% in the autumn.
But they signaled that, in the coming years, interest rate hikes would be needed to rein in Brexit-fueled inflation, and they said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year after Brexit.
It will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide GBP 15 billion more under this system - £115 billion.
Minutes after the interest rate decision, the Bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as pressure on real household incomes continues to weigh on consumption."
On interest rates, she reiterated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and a "slightly larger" extent than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "gradual" and "limited."
The Bank's downward-revised growth forecasts for this year and next year are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after this news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to USD 1.31 and fell by 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision does not change after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations for a rate hike, and GDP has risen from 0.2% in the second quarter to 0.3% in the preceding three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although the bank is expected to recover slightly towards the end of the year.
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households, which will be affected by rising inflation and slight salary increases, as the tightening will get worse first, before it will improve.
She added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" the income drop in the next few years, "but she added that wages will" recover significantly "at the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods, owing to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of the lower consumption spending.
The decision comes one year after the fall in interest rates to 0.25% last August, following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to reach prices and the economy in full.
Before the Bank's recent interest-rate judgment, the call for an increase in interest rates increased, as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell last month from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the Bank said that this was expected and that it would pick up again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the excess relative to its 2% target was "entirely" attributable to the weak pound.

NHS (The National Health Service) is expected to prescribe 10,000 controversial HIV drug
Patients will have access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment as of September, following a fight before the High Court against funding the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that a pre-intercourse pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by about 86 percent, is now supplied by the health service for a first three-year.
He agreed to finance the process after last year's Court of Appeal confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP, despite the claim that local authorities should finance it.
The action announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS UK boss Simon Stevens as "important new intervention," whereas the National AIDS Trust (NAT) called this "decisive moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool, and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, and more clinics will follow in October, before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in case of infection risks.
Taking prep before intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in a person's body to prevent an HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken every day or even two hours before sexual intercourse.
Among those eligible for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree with the study, including men, women, transgender and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The programme will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver drugs this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study will assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is used, absorbed, and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: "This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than three decades of sustained progress in addressing one of humanity's biggest health challenges. "
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive of NAT (National AIDS Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
Prep, if targeted at needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-financed experiment in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, which will improve many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP Test Medicine has been obtained, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV. "
Sharon Hodgson, Minister for Health, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and slow government implementation.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV-infected and that it will help us move closer to bringing an end to the spread of HIV in society.

It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"Before that, I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day. "
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot large apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and an mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
That was my request, "she says.
To this end, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the foot 12.5 high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms above each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an mezzanine where one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the preset.
"The steel mill is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked over each other without us having to walk.
It was not just a question of building a simple platform, but of putting steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below. "
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with much additional drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to let it work longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all cutlery and glasses of Joanne.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went into it," Erfan explains from the steel reinforced MDF door.
"It is important in reverse, so that when you push the door up, it glides very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on land size."
Here they have managed to increase the floor area and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things that touch you and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You do not fall into the electric sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "
It shows that a flat can be transformed by a good design and an increased square meter of something by default into something quite amazing.
Indeed, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.

Brothers fight for $500 million in real estate empire
Two brothers, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, are engaged in a dispute over one of the largest property empires in Victorias, worth more than $500 million.
Former Director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother, Paul, who has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute about separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a business at Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the Westco UNK family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for USD 85 million.
This money has been invested in real estate and the portfolio of De LUTIS now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centres in the suburbs.
According to an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the De LUTIS family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one-third.
A file of law states that this means that Colin's property is worth $316 million and Paul owns $176 million.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first Affidavit.
Last Friday, after several failed mediation, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, has ruled out.
Colin argues that this is not true, but Paul argues that some properties are under incompetent management.
In an early Affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian legacy prescribes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The cost increases in the case, with hundreds of pages of Affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC.
Mrs De LUTIS and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950 "s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They took advantage of the security to buy the Collingwood property, which opened Colin the first jealous shop of the family.
Colin says that he started Westco there when he was "high school in my last years, when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De LUTIS says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property amicably to their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De LUTIS group, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid 10 million dollars when leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars.
According to Paul, both Lukas and Mark have become bitterly embittered about the conditions of their financial separation. "
Colin was very reluctant, although he was a former AFL member of the board and was the best friend of the TV star after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De LUTIS and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied by SMS to say "I really can't say much," because the case is before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and to draw our surname through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the General Court that he had tried to satisfy his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute," he said and added that he "still hope for a solution."
On Friday, this hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
We strongly condemn the disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force.

- for those Member States whose currency is higher than the ECU equivalent calculated on the basis of the common agricultural policy (green rate), currency equalisation is levied on imports and granted to exports (positive WAB);
To this end, the WAB is no longer calculated according to the difference between the green rate and the central rate, but according to the difference between the green rate and the "guiding price multiplied by a correction factor."

Trump's new chief of staff is planning to reduce the president's media abstinence.
Others tried it and failed.
Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do so.
If so, it will be the first.
Politico reports that the White House's new chief of staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even course.
Here is a play by Reporters Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the White House's new chief of staff, met senior officials on his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he intended to repair: Poor information that was in his hands.
Kelly told employees that information about him should flow, whether on paper or in briefings, because the president would make better decisions if he were given good information. "
Waiter's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by watching his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was angry about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from positions that were to be persuaded," said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February to Politico.
Policy Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise price."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we do not know for others - that Trump's tweets would have contained even more fuel without their interventions.
We will probably never know anything about the tweets Trump has not sent.
If his employees have managed to keep him out of trouble several times, their efforts have been worthwhile.
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House composed of competing parties, people repeatedly try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump with material that may promote their views from the world.
In May, politico - which is all about this story - reported on the preference of consultants to provide dubious information to the President for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by Reporters Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump, like a volcano, can respond to negative press excerpts, especially those with shameful leaks, and that he is intent on figuring out where they come from.
That is exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet vocalist Charles C. Johnson, who accused Deputy Head of Katie Walsh. "
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, or had not offered any concrete evidence, or had in the past made false accusations and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began to ask employees about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary General Rob Porter "tried to implement a system to manage and document Trump's paperwork."
How did this work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than a priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still seek influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
In short, they fear that all the sacrifices made for price stability will have been in vain.

In the current boom, contagion occurred within markets and across markets, as rising prices fuel enthusiasm - and thus further price rises - first within a city, and then in other cities, even at the other end of the world.
Historically, home prices have developed an enormous dynamic, and prices in these cities are still rising rapidly, even though this increase is somewhat slower than it was a year or more ago.
Based on a surge in growth trends, it seems certain that prices in most of these cities will increase significantly over a further year or more, even if the rate of increase continues to decline.
Prices in glamour cities are likely to fall sharply in the next severe recession, or in the event of a shock to the local economy, as well as at soaring interest rates.
In this case, contagion within and across markets could trigger a downward spiral and lower prices for years.
Travellers negotiate a moat and return to the 'millionaire rice'.
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands are once again at war with some determined travelers who have negotiated a ditch drawn from the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a prosperous road of Solihull, which is called the "millionaire series."
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out only in May, but without being deterred by a ditch buried by the Council in order to prevent their incursions.
The tacle group found a gap in defence facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unobstructed to find a way.
Angry residents have pushed the Council of Solihull to say that it is "useless to deal with the problem."
An anonymous inhabitant said: "They moved there on Monday evening, after being sent back by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones onto the passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame, because it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, moved on and are now back.
More came last night, probably more today. "
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by keeping long instructions to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my common tax if the Council cannot even stop it. "
A resident who did not want to be called said: "It is ridiculous, we have just seen the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round.
The figures have increased this time, and even a horse has been seen in the park area. "
As one speaker of the Solihull Council said, "We are aware of an unauthorised camp on the land beyond Streetsbrook Road and work with the police of Solihulls.
In order to support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This will help to provide a picture of the situation in which the Court will have to examine when we will present our case. "

From birhof, Waldhotel Luise will become
The Waldhotel Luise will be transformed from the former Hotel birhof.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.
This is good news for the city.
With the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente UNK gesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, around 30 000 nights were lost per year and revenue from the tourist tax was also lost.
In the autumn of 2014, with dramatically increasing numbers of refugees coming to the county, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation to the County Council Office, causing controversial discussions.
The city prevented asylum seekers from being accommodated by drawing up a development plan in order to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision at the time was not uncontroversial in the municipal council.
But especially Freudenstadts OberUNK meister Julian Osswald defended the location of the hotel and talked at the time of serious visitors to the hotel.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels group with its managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, purchased the former Hotel birhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to turn it back into a three-star Waldhotel Plus category.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
The former Hotel birhof has been standing in front of the entrance for a long time and, when you enter the house, you will see the large amount of renovation work that is being carried out.
The floors were torn out, some of the ceilings were dismantled, old bathtubs were removed from the rooms.
The entire building is a single construction site.
There is still much to be done by March.
"It is actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is transformed and new windows are installed.
Everything should become "nice to the citizen," as Thomas Scherer puts it.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are all equipped.
The staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel was
The Waldhotel Luise, with its approximately 60 rooms, wants to be more spacious, explains Scherer.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel at home in the hotel.
He has already had talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourist director Michael Krause, he said Scherer.
The city's sights are identical to those of the Hotel Group.
"We are on the same line."
When asked about the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to be precise.
Just under EUR 1 million, he reckons.
The exterior systems are also brought to the front, which is already clearly visible.
In an inner courtyard there is a large terrace, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is open to the public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no longer any way around it.
The "much more important task" is about to happen on Sunday.
Not a single accident is the same, and calculating the cost of the parts and hours worked can be a lengthy and complicated task.

Russia affair: US special investigators set up Grand Jury
In the Russia affair for US President Donald Trump, special investigators Robert Mueller are alleged to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report.
The panel has begun its work in recent weeks, wrote the Wall Street Journal on the basis of people who are familiar with the matter.
The newspaper took the step as a sign that Mueller had extended and intensified his investigation.
CNN reported that there are already some preliminary charges from the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
For some time now, US intelligence agencies have accused the Kremlin of deliberately interfering in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller examines whether there were deals between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation will focus on several men who campaigned as Republican counsellor.
According to reports, Mueller also examined more and more Trump's private and business environment.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Envoy Trump had personally moved to the center and accused the president of possibly obstructing justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine evidence available in possible criminal cases and to decide whether to prosecute.
Grand Jurys are therefore also known as the UNK UNK.
Most of the time, they are involved in larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.
The Board may also be involved by the Public Prosecutor's Office in order to invite persons to interrogate under oath.
According to CNN, preliminary charges have already been issued about the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People who took part in the meeting had been asked to make a statement, as stated in the report.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his then-election chief, Paul UNK fort, also attended the conversation.
Legal experts said on US television on Thursday evening that the appointment showed that Mueller was not intimidated in his work and that he wanted to act quickly if necessary.
However, it should not necessarily be the case that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the prosecution.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the panel marks the start of a new phase in investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of new revelations, on Thursday evening, the President used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"Russia's history is a complete invention," Trump said.
The issue gives the democrats a chance to "feel good, because they have nothing else they can talk about."
His special adviser, Ty Cobb, stated in an opinion that he did not know anything about the creation of a Grand Jury.
However, he stressed that these work normally in secret.
The White House is in favour of any measures to speed up the work of the Special Investigator in a 'fair' manner.
The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that the president would not be investigated.
There is no reason to think that something has changed in this respect, as stated in the statement.
But Mueller had only been used after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this outrages, accusations against Trump had been made that he wanted to obstruct the judiciary.
In June, Comey told a Senate Committee that Trump had asked him to stop investigating the then national security adviser, Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure for the investigation.
According to U.S. media, the White House collected material against the special broker and his staff.
This triggered speculation about Trump's intention to dismiss Mueller.
Unlike an independent Congressional Special Envoy, such as the Watergate affair surrounding the then-resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the justice ministry at the insistence of the president.
But several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators put forward draft laws on Thursday that would make it impossible for the Special Envoy to be dismissed so easily.
Antarctica: Giant Eisberg drives Antarctica
In the Westantarktis, a gigantic iceberg from the nearly seven-fold size of Berlin has been removed from the Scheldt.
This was shared by the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The colossus, which weighs more than one trillion tonnes and has a size of 5800 square kilometres, is now going to drive north and will probably take two or three years until it has melted.
With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the biggest giant ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades.
He does not pose a threat to people.
According to research, the extent to which climate change has played a role in breaking off the iceberg is unclear.
However, for about 30 years there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice elves in the region, writes the US Research Centre for UNK and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be linked to global warming.
The now broken colossus has been part of the Larsen-C ice ice.
Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It is therefore growing ever further into the sea and regularly breaks down.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis lies south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic peninsula.
To the north of this ice-cream, the balance of wax and breakage was disrupted a few years ago.
AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete ice cream.
There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Scheldt is also in danger, because the front edge has never been as far removed as it is at present.
In addition, the ice plate is under stress and can fall apart if a piece is broken down at a key point.
The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase the sea level, as they swim on the water and ice suppresses as much water as it does after the melting itself.
However, the loss of the ice on the river Scheldt means that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.
This could possibly increase sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the United Kingdom's research project on Antarctica (Midas).
According to AWI figures, the Larsen-C-Scheldt is the fourth largest ice-cream in Antarctica, covering almost 50,000 square kilometres.
On the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks off regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the Ice Shield is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O fucking Leary of Swansea University, UK.
"This is the most lenient retreat since records began," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it is controversial whether the Larsen-C-Scheldt will grow again or fall back in the long term and possibly fall together, "his colleague Adrian Luckman said," Our models say that it will be less stable. "
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, a great many of the Antarctica Peninsula's iron shelves have fallen apart in recent decades.
This long corner of Antarctica stretches towards South America.
According to the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by about three degrees over the past 50 years, making it one of the fastest growing areas.
The Kyoto Protocol Adaptation Fund will be managed by a 16-member Council, probably at the UN's Global Environment Facility (GEF), as can be read in "Piac és Profit."

CDU wants a special rate for staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU is calling for the employers' association to leave in order to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, UNK stag has opened 41 new posts in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now, another 17 apprentices have their first working day behind them.
The teacher posts at the circle seem to be highly sought after.
Some 620 applications were received for the places to be awarded this year.
However, there is still a shortage of staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
At present there are still 50 vacant posts in the Mettmann district.
Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as general administration.
The CDU, together with the FDP and UWG, now wants to take the initiative in the UNK stag together with the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) and the UWG to counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
According to the wishes of the parties, the administration should "develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development."
The aim is not only to provide short-term training to skilled workers, but also to counter the shortage of candidates in a forward-looking manner, it is said.
The overall concept should be oriented towards the inside and outside world, show concrete measures for cross-entry participants and include a training offensive, the CDU, the FDP and the UWG demand.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with staff problems that were not known before.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
We are talking about a genuine 'competition between public employers'.
In addition, there are a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.
It is therefore high time to act so that more jobs are not left vacant.
But Klaus-Dieter UNK, member of the CDU Group, goes beyond the joint request with his party.
He recently caused a lazy surprise on the day of a chalk, when he publicly questioned the staff cost coverage and startled the other parties.
People want to see a review of all the possibilities for leaving the municipal employers' association.
"If we do not find a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with local cities - should aim for a national tariff," so the people.
In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay the employees and civil servants better than it actually provides for the provision of tariffs for the public service.
Salaries are currently strictly prescribed; increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level based on professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new spaces had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new law on prostitution.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: They have too few staff.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who choose the Republican side more to use the electoral maps issued by these clubs.

Italy exacerbates the sound of NGO migrants "rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs using rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue to do so unless they adhere to new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German Youth Rettet aid organisation because their team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed allegations made by the Italian Public Prosecutor Ambrogio CARTOSIO.
"For us, saving human life is and will remain our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," said the organisation in an opinion on the social media.
"We can assess all the accusations that are currently being made only after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Youth Rettet', Iuventa, since October.
It is believed that his crew will take infra-red migrants, which are delivered directly to them by traffickers, and that the smugglers will be able to leave so that the ships can be used again.
At least such a meeting was said to have taken place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the file of the prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of ignoring the authority of the Italian Coast Guard to monitor rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reason.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to adhere to the code: Save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary but acceptable, as they would not entail "substantial changes or obstacles" to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel laureate organisation is Médecins sans Frontières (MSF).
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy following the rescue measures has declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and to cooperate with the local civil service have come to fruition.
"In the last few days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger, and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries hoping to reach Europe.
A modest home market compared to global sales.
The Central and Eastern European countries have become more important to Switzerland since their accession to the EU, both as production locations and as sales and procurement markets.
When oil prices reached $150 a barrel, sales in the US were already sliding in favor of more economical models.
In the case of BMW, the growth rates in sales of the first six months of the year were even 100%.
We also have this experience in investing in the sale of road cars.
And he adds that providing information about a company's philanthropic activities is just as important as communicating sales or competitor information on board meetings.
The sales of TrueView Ads, i.e. advertising clips played either before the beginning of a video or displayed as display advertising next to it, also increased by 45% last year.
The trained industrial engineer (Berchting) and the robotics specialist (Guernier) are convinced that their product will be sold and expect 80 000 to 100 000 airbags to be sold annually in the future.
Selling computers, printers, servers, and additional storage capacity will lag behind software and services for the time being, but will catch up over time and may even drive up revenues on the highly competitive PC market.
After a 10% decline compared with the previous year in the first quarter of 2013, PC sales to companies moved around the same level in the second quarter, which is expected to stabilise sales figures.
Increases and trials
Nine Weilermer UNK, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good base for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led to MichaelUNK elle above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards.
There were observation points, some of which were towers, from which one could view far beyond the PUNK zer forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there were always longer increases, for which long trials were rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest sausage market.
Once again, the viewpoint at the viewpoint, connected by the "flowige" trials and moderate increases.
On the last two days, many metres of altitude were called for again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and recreational huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim the bikers used saline water in the outdoor inhalation.
New town was also introduced.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude, the group had met the PUNK zer Forest from its best side - sporty and cultural.
UNK statt UNK - Bundesliga UNK sich für E-Sport
Will the sport stars be sitting in front of computer consoles instead of fighting in the wind and weather over the stadium?
The fact is that e-sports has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - including big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high scales.
This has also been recognised by the first federal league associations, which are increasingly involved in this area.
FC Schalke 04 and the last VfB Stuttgart, who founded an E-Sport department in mid-July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract.
"We hope to attract new young target groups to VfB," says Managing Director Jochen Röttgermann.
He is certain that there are still a number of clubs on this train.
This weekend, FIFA, the World Football Association, will be organising the first Interactive Club World Cup in London, where the gamblers of different clubs will compete.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt, too, sees great potential in e-sport.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football, in particular, has to deal with the 14-30 year-olds that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-athletes under contract, you could be present on these markets much more often online than just sending the German federal league team to Asia once a year.
What exactly is it about?
In E-Sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or even FIFA's football simulation are fought at the level of competition.
For a long time now, as in normal sports, leagues have established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other.
E-Sport is already part of the official program at Asia Games 2022.
But is this a real sport?
For many, the idea is certainly worth getting used to.
Ingo FrobUNK has also been dealing with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports Academy in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and displays many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions.
It also needs cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding, and rapid responsiveness.
Professional gamers should not only train their bodies at the console, but also take care of their diet.
"The fit player is a good player."

A study by Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth for e-sport.
In 2016, €50 million had been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to be 130 million.
This is little against the nearly EUR 2.4 billion of the Football League.
However, e-sport is "not far from other well-established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," writes Deloitte consultants.
Many countries are already on the international stage.
Major markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball players Shaquille O Brazilian Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.

In the Netherlands and France, according to Dutt, football clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sport department.
"In European comparison, Germany lags behind," explains VfB's Board of Management Röttgermann.
It is no longer enough to fall into nostalgia and to clarify the old times.
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association but at the same time to align the company with the modern market.

Unfortunately, the European system of public art finance is falling victim to slow economic growth and growing budget deficits.
An immediate deployment of an appropriate civilian and security presence during the months immediately after NATO's 1999 bombing campaign might have created appropriate safeguards against the backlash that made victims become perpetrators.
One of these projects aims to provide medical information to developing countries via the Internet, to provide communication equipment and experts on disaster and humanitarian emergencies, and a third to provide much more children worldwide with vaccination.
However, access to resources is only part of the problem and I would like to emphasise once again the importance of denouncing the production, distribution and use of these indiscriminate weapons.
The Forum, which successfully concluded its fourth meeting in February 2000, focuses in particular on forest issues from the point of view of sustainable forest management, addressing not only the causes of deforestation but also the trade in forest products and the use of forest products.

Poison eggs - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking
In the meantime, almost all the Länder have been hit by the scandal of toxic eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and taken all eggs out of sale throughout Germany.

In this performance very balanced encounter, however, Marcus UNK utto's TSV team consistently voted for the great physical commitment and a positive commitment of both teams.
The Council is currently examining the extent to which these mechanisms are included in Article 7.
We therefore ask the rapporteur, the Commission and the Council to supplement the agricultural policy section with the fisheries part, for example, by making the agricultural and fisheries aspects of enlargement.
I would particularly like to address the Council, which, unfortunately, is largely absent, but which has some expectations and concerns.
The compound feedingstuffs industry has tried once again to influence the Council and to overturn the open declaration.
I would like to point out to Members that the Council's working group unanimously decided to recommend to the Council that a joint committee be set up in the action programme, which could increase the influence of each Member State by combining management and consultation procedures.
We believe that there is a disagreement in the report on the issue, which my group does not agree on, namely whether the establishment of an internal auditor should only be required for the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament or also for the smaller institutions.
Let me give you two examples: The Education Council, together with the mobility of students and teachers, because we have seen a marked disparity in mobility between men, and the Internal Market, Consumption and Tourism Council, in conjunction with the agenda item.
I must admit, therefore, that this amendment, as the Council and the Commission have said, is not justified in this case, and I would like to take this opportunity once again to recall that the procedures of import controls in the European Union will not work properly
The Commission and the Council will do that, and that is the most important thing that is currently on the agenda in Yugoslavia; it has always been in our interest.
With regard to the Intergovernmental Conference, I believe that the work carried out before Biarritz at ministerial level has progressed as far as possible, and the informal Council has therefore taken place at the right time to confirm certain progress to give guidelines for the final stage.
Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate the European Council for adopting the draft Charter as binding.
Meeting the demands of the large countries for more power in the Council and Parliament would upset the balance within the European Union and lead to the small countries paying the whole price for enlargement.
We must support the efforts of Mr Prodi and Mr Patten to strengthen the Commission's ability to act through parliamentary scrutiny and the necessary parliamentary scrutiny, which is not, of course, the Council and Mr Solana.
Although we share the criticism of the Council on many points, it remains to be seen that it would be a politically non-indirect confrontation and would undermine credibility in European institutions.
I do not want the impression to be created that the Council does not respond to the questions put to it.
The Council is actively examining the Commission's proposal and the amendments mentioned in order to reach an opinion on this issue as soon as possible.
At that time, we did not know that the Council and the Commission had pledged aid for the reconstruction of Serbia and Kosovo from these funds.
Mr President, the Council has actually outperformed itself with the draft budget for 2001.
In this respect, and also in view of the Commission's understanding that the Member States' requests for payments for the Structural Funds for 2001 exceed the estimates of the PDB by 8 billion, I think it is time for the Council to give serious consideration. "
In due course, this support and signal will also be required in relation to the Council.
Several proposals have already been submitted to the Council and Parliament, such as the package of proposals for recasting and updating hygiene rules.
I would therefore ask you to convey to the Council, which is not here, and to the Commission the importance of increasing this amount, as, unfortunately, there are between 20 and 50 new mines for each cleared mine.
Abandoning the requirement for closer cooperation within the framework of the Treaty and abolishing the right of veto and the possibility of submitting the issue to the European Council would be a breach of fundamental principles of European cooperation within the EU.
The General Affairs Council already agreed on the first five action plans for Somalia, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Morocco and Iraq last October.
The committee responsible has followed me in this, and the signals from the Council are also positive.
The Council will have to ask itself whether it has done more harm than good to this cause by awarding Turkey candidate status.
At its meeting in Feira in June 2000, the Council adopted a common EU strategy for the Mediterranean and the European Commission, having proposed and implemented the reform of the MEDA Regulation, recently adopted a document on the intensification of the Barcelona Process.
The Commission and the Council express their willingness to do so.
What diplomatic initiatives does the Council intend to take in order to bring Armenia / Azerbaijan closer together to resolve their bilateral differences and to promote their cooperation?
Secondly, in its response to NATO, the Council refers to the Pontius Pilate, without commenting on the provocative violation by Turkey of Greece's sovereign rights, this time on the occasion of the NATO mantle.
Other countries, however, definitely want the compensation fund, and I have to tell you quite frankly that if we were to propose a compulsory introduction of the compensation fund now, the result would be that we could forget it because there would never be a majority in the Council.
Let me give you one example: As you know, the Council has had difficulties in banning exports of products that are considered unsafe to third countries, whereas this ban is very important to the European Parliament and we fully support it.
The Garot report aims to improve the Commission's proposal in a number of respects by trying to find a compromise solution with the Council, in particular on financial participation in the fund.
The Council of the European Union also plays an active role, in cooperation with your institution and the European Commission, in updating and constantly strengthening European rules on the prevention and control of this disease.
The Commission and the Council of the European Union have a heavy responsibility for the extent to which the mad cow crisis has taken place.
Parliament can be proud that the proposal to set up this academy was born here, and we are grateful to the Portuguese Presidency for having taken it on board, and we thank the Commission and the Council for their support.
A declaration on the economic, social and cultural characteristics of sport and its social function in Europe is also being prepared for the European Council.
His voice would be stronger, and the voice of ministers defending agriculture in the service of sustainable development would also be much stronger in the Council if it could be based on decisions taken here in the codecision procedure.
As requested by Mr Brok in his report, the Council will have summary documents setting out relations between the Union and the individual partner countries in order to better prepare the Union's overall foreign policy efforts and to make them more effective.
I would also like to point out that, in all the positions taken by the Council, there is no budgetary obligation on the part of the European Union to finance any military activity.
Furthermore, it is completely illogical that only the Council can amend the Financial Regulation, and we repeat our amendment on this point.
On many points, as Mr Watts has already explained, the European Parliament is more stringent than it appears to be in the Council.
Discussions have also been held with the sectors concerned and there have been many contacts with the French Presidency with a view to reaching a consensus text which can be adopted swiftly by the two legislative bodies, the Council and the European Parliament.
I would like to say to Mr Jarzembowski that the Council is not seeking a compromise.
"It is clear that there can be an incompetent and provocative official, but if 15 Member States agree to such answers, I believe you must take the initiative and urge the Council to respect a prerogative of Members of the European Parliament.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that the debate on proportionality (votes in the Council and seats in Parliament), that is, the balance of power between the Member States, has opened up a Pandora's box, which will hardly be repeated in Nice.
The report has been the subject of difficult discussions in the Council.
I have been told by my chairman of the Committee on Budgets that it is the first time that an agreement has been reached between the Council and Parliament in a concierge.
Ultimately, it was the weighting of votes in the Council that was most debated and where it was most difficult to reach a decision.
Speaking as a representative of the groups that form part of the European Free Alliance, I would like to warn the Commission, but above all the Council, if the EU wants to be no more than an intergovernmental community.
But the Nice European Council, like many other summits in the history of the European Union, represents a victory for reality, a victory for pragmatism over utopia.
If the Council wanted to do so, it would be imprudent and unwise.
Secondly, has the Council been informed by the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights, who is well represented on the ground?
What improvements will the Council make to Directive 92 / 12 / EEC, which is referred to here, so that the responsibilities of the supplier and the recipient are clearly defined without the possibility of fraud?
In accordance with Article 23 of the Treaty on European Union, such a decision will be taken unanimously by the Council, as will all other decisions with defence implications.
Mr President, as the Groupement Européen des Sociétés d'Auteurs et de Compositeurs rightly points out, the draft we are discussing here has been attacked inappropriately in the course of its examination by the Council.
Secondly, this issue will be on the agenda at the Telecommunications Council next Friday.
At the trialogue meeting, it became clear that the Council was not prepared to make concessions on this issue.
The precautionary principle was also discussed at the Nice Summit, which took note of a resolution adopted by the General Affairs Council.
The 2001 budget is largely based on a compromise between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, which we support.
The Nice European Council had a positive aspect: By deciding on a new weighting of votes and a new distribution of MEPs, with the involvement of the Eastern European candidate countries, it gave them a strong signal of their willingness to accept them as soon as possible.
Michelle Carter condemned for the texts that Conrad Roy is pushing for suicide.
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend to commit suicide by means of texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars, and five years have been suspended on probation.
Carter was convicted in June of his careless killing by Conrad Roy, who died on 13 July 2014.
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is uncomforting.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was allowed to remain free to appeal.
She was faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a creamy blouse, Carter stood with tears in his eyes, with folded hands and looking down eyes, when convicted.
"Their actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"They ended his life in order to make their own better.
She took no responsibility, "she said.
"She has not shown any remorse."
But Carters lawyer said it was "a terrible circumstance that she deeply regrets."
Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, that he did not find out that her "age, maturity or even mental illness have a significant impact on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement by Roys's mother, Lynn Roy, who said that there is "no day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and to follow everything, and I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pain we will carry with us for eternity, "says
Roys's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she was "persecuted" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
"Not to have this only person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carters revealed text messages that they had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang up, spring from a building, tell yourself, I do not know there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on holiday with his family.
In the eyes of his suicide, she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "Everything you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case through any press.
The case has divided the legal opinion.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, sentenced in 2007 for murder of her British fellow citizens in Italy before being acquitted two years ago.
Mrs Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."

Joshua Kimmir: Learning from the new FC Bayern Mini-Lahm
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmir was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup.
The FC Bayern cheers the Confed Cup winner a great season - extra motivation does not hurt.
There was something different in his place in the cabin, so Joshua Kimmir immediately saw me, even if the additional item of clothing was very small.
But since no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel UNK were to be seen on the second day of the Audi Cup, he made the binding to his arm.
"The trainer did not announce it," the Confed Cup winner later, after his first bet as a Bavaria captain.
Good, the stand could have run better than the 0: 2 against the SSC Naples.
But the character of the coach could interpret Kimme as well.
It was not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal who was chosen as the game leader by the pro C-Elf, made up of young players, debutants and just out-of-holiday professionals.
You prefer to distribute sugar to those who have a lot to chew, who you want to keep at your whim.
So if you have been chosen to take up the heritage of Lahm, you can only use a little extra motivation.
Kimmir confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: Take responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flipped over the field as a mini-Lahm.
On the right side, this is now its position, the white binding on the arm did its rest.
And Kimme worked like the one who can best take the helm in his hand in this initial formation.
He gave instructions, tried to guide the played force.
He had a look for the whole, while many others were self-employed.
Vidal by overplaying his lack of fitness (did not fold); Renato Sanches with it, to devil come out to the performance of the Asia trip (also only partially folded); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas.
That, after all, worked very well.
Süle ran alongside Kimme, Rudy before the defense, both acting sovereign.
The famous Napoli storm was often difficult, and Süle also tried to build up a game a few times.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not as we hoped it would."
But he, too, did a decent job on his debut.
Relocation of games, change of pace: "I was also called for this style."
How uninhabited this Bavaria world is for the new entrants was seen after the match.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but determined six or seven.
Kimmir decided to leave after a few tough statements in the back of his new fellow players.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "What is going on here, I have already noticed.
In Bavaria, you simply have to win every game. "
After all, he no longer needs to teach the new.
Alaba motivates ÖFB-UNK
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB-Ladies
Shortly before the match, Austria's best known footballer reported on Twitter and wanted the ÖFB-UNK all the best.
The Bavarian legionnaire is a kind of club-mate of ÖFB-UNK änin Schnaderbeck and is a member of our Ladys.
The tweet of the Austrian soccer of the year and the Champions League winner should be a special motivational injection.
Our ladies might well need the famous Bavaria-Dusel.

In court, the defendant initially claimed that he was suffering from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died alongside him in an explosion.
The court no longer had to hear any of the women affected.
The Court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700-page law, and also argued that the health-care law's requirement that states either extend the access conditions for Medicaid or otherwise remove all government-incompatible Medicaid subsidies was not.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in court to cheer the new president, and contrary to Mubarak's presidential pomp, traffic was stopped for a short time, so that the convoy could cross the southern side of the road.
However, by abandoning the official oath to the court and not, as usual, to Parliament, he is bowing to the will of the military, which indicates that the power struggle will continue.

Businesses satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Business praises Wissing Tempo
It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still the Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs, Volker Wissing (FDP), is in office.
Chambers and enterprises from the region speak of a change in economic policy - and at the same time they blame the old minister - to T V's question.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trierer Enterprises (VTU), says: "Wissing responds to the wishes of business, which Lemke has all blocked."
Natus's biggest U-turn is in infrastructure policy: The closure of the motorway 1 between Kelberg and UNK au is now at the top of the country's list of priorities.
This year, the Ministry hopes for a planning process, until 2021 the construction law will be in place.
The WestumUNK Trier also plays a role in the country's plans, which is in the urgent need of the BundesUNK UNK geUNK.
The aim is to start the route in December 2020, says Minister-spreader Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a signpost to support regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier, as suggested by Wissing, aims to create a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to halt the trend of German wine exports, which have lasted for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company, praises the Chamber of Commerce.
The UNK skammer Trier sees in the new Master Bonus an additional incentive for young trainees, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
It provides for a premium of €1000 for the recognised master examination and €2500 for graduates to become self-employed within ten years of their master training.
But the homework list for the country remains a long one.
According to Jan UNK auer, Chief Executive of IHK Trier, the country lacks the necessary staff for the planned road construction.
Out of 56 new engineers that Wissing plans to employ mobility at home, only 29 posts have been filled.
The Chamber of Commerce demands that more orders be given to external offices.
Christian Baldauf, a member of the CDU group, refers to Court of Auditors' calculations, the country invests more than EUR 20 million less in the maintenance of national roads than proposed in 2017 and 2018.
Frank Natus also expects a country's approach to address the skills shortage in the region.
It was also sobering to see the roll-out of broadband in the country so far.
In 2016, regional companies only rated network supply in an IHK survey with a rating of 3.4.
They complained about faltering Internet connections and breakdowns.
On the other hand, the former Minister for Economic Affairs, Eveline Lemke, is currently out of politics and is still on the Supervisory Board of the wind turbine company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where, after four months of disagreements, it has already returned to the field.

Audi is expected to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a backlash
One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW President said that the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe would be modified to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertakings as a call-back.
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
However, the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to car manufacturers of installing plants to neutralise the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also being accused of spoiling powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes, which have allowed the use of so-called 'turn-off' devices that have managed to regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested but is driving back under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been charged, while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent the emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was extended.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could place a heavy burden on Volkswagen: The luxury automobile manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen's profits.
Instead of helping the Röszke camp to establish structures that guarantee humanity, our Federal Chancellor has placed the Hungarian Government's position in the Dunstkreis of National Socialism in a highly official and public manner.
When negotiations began six months ago, Britain was in the business of taking over the presidency of the European Council.
This is precisely what the European Commission did recently when it presented its first strategy for the post-Kyoto arm, which will be discussed by the European Council in March.
The Commission has the task of monitoring the practical application of this legal framework in the framework of its role as laid down by the Treaty.
I therefore think it is entirely appropriate to entrust an external and morally unassailable authority with this task in this case.
This remains a task for the future.
Madam President, it has been mentioned what the role of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs could be.
Enlargement has presented you and all of us with the same task that Monnet and Schuman and others faced fifty years ago: One method, one structure and one vision for the future of Europe.

It shows a mountain of rubbish.
The launch of a publicity campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
The motto "True love is..." is to sharpen understanding for the Isar as a protected game flow.
As early as last summer, the raft crossed the isar and this year, there are other actions and measures to achieve responsible and environmentally responsible behaviour.
The European Monetary Cooperation Fund (EFWZ), headed by a Governing Board composed of members of the Committee of Presidents of Central Banks and a member of the Commission, is primarily responsible for ensuring the functioning of the EMS system in March 1979. "
However, this monetary mechanism of the EMS differs from that of the "snake" by accepting the EMS from all the Member States (the United Kingdom and Greece are not yet participating in the intervention mechanism), so it is a Community system.
However, this monetary mechanism of the EMS differs from that of the "snake" by accepting the EMS from all the Member States (the United Kingdom and Greece are not yet participating in the intervention mechanism), so it is a Community system.
This was the mechanism that became famous under the name of 'snake in the tunnel' (European currency snake).
The "snake" was the narrower fluctuation band allowed for intra-Community currency exchanges, while the "tunnel" was the larger fluctuation band allowed for the exchange of Community currencies in dollars.
In the meantime, the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (established in 1973 to manage the snake in the bandwidth mechanism) continues to serve as a forerunner to the new institution.
It is forbidden to hunt, catch, disrupt, kill, alive or dead, damage, sell, transport or others completely protected animals (in Upper Austria these are the most birds and snakes as well as all lizards and amphibians).
So it's just a bit that he cares more about snakes than about horses.
He did a lot for our snakes, but he did not care about our horses. "
I have too much respect for the dogs, let the snakes zish, our caravan continues with the quiet certainty that every non-European invasion in the evening followed a Poitier, a leprosy, a Vienna.
Objectives c. In 1972, the mechanism of the "snake in the tunnel" reduced the fluctuation margins between the Community currencies (snake) against the bands between these currencies and the dollar (tunnel).
The exchange-rate stability mechanism was introduced and resumed, and the snake, originally conceived as a Community-wide arrangement, was reduced to a zone of currency stability around the DM.
(Snake) to limit to ± 2.25% and the fluctuation margins between these currencies and the dollar (tunnel) to ± 4.5%.
Community restrictions of 2.25% (the "snake") were maintained by the original Member States of the Community and Denmark, with the fluctuation of those currencies against the dollar (the "tunnel") limited to 4.5%.
The return of the French franc to line-up, the relatively satisfactory functioning of this system and the introduction of a European unit of account have been characteristic of this development.
In 1975, negotiations on the inclusion of the Swiss franc in the "snake" were held in order to contribute to greater exchange rate stability in Europe.
The logical consequence of this was that there were repeated difficulties in the foreign exchange markets: The French franc left the "snake," the pound and the lira suffered a sharp fall in the foreign exchange markets, and the Deutsche Mark was added.
Re-adjustment of intervention rates within the "snake"; the central rate of the DM will be upgraded by 2% compared to the ERE.
Within the "snake," two exchange-rate adjustments were made, both of which concerned the Scandinavian currencies.
In setting prices for 1978 / 79, this border adjustment has been reduced, but has been raised again as a result of exchange rate changes in floating currencies and appreciation within the queue.
During the start-up period of the system, the Member States that are not part of the queue may decide for a limited period of time to opt for some more bandwidths.
The question remains whether it will be able to resist the ups and downs that brought down the "snake."
The former "floatete," the latter were bound into the queue and could only fluctuate within a given frame.
In the EMS, the unit of account for the "snake" will be replaced by the ECU corresponding to the value of the ERE, which is approximately 21% below the value of the "snake unit."
However, the United Kingdom and Ireland, followed by Italy, leave the "snake."
However, the European Union can also record undeniable successes: The British renegotiation of 1975. the general election of the European Parliament and, on 12 March 1979, the introduction of the European Monetary System (EMS), which has replaced the "snake."
This construction was known as the 'snake in the tunnel', with fluctuations between Community currencies forming the snake and the external fluctuation limits approved by the IMF.
The three candidate countries, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark, joined the queue in May 1972, but were unable to keep to the discipline involved and left the queue after a few months.
At the beginning of 1974, France and Italy also left the queue, which thus consisted only of a small number of currencies under the leading position of the Deutsche Mark.
This was the birth of the "snake in the tunnel."
The snake was half as wide (2.25%) as the tunnel (4.5%).
It was also decided that interventions aimed at keeping European currencies in line should, in principle, take place in European currencies, while dollar interventions should only be allowed to prevent the snake from breaking out of the tunnel.
The EEC Commission then proposed a common float of European currencies against the dollar - that is, maintaining the queue but leaving the tunnel - including the possibility of changing parities within the queue within certain borders and under certain conditions.
In September 1974, French Finance Minister Fourcade proposed a plan for a coordinated floating of all Community currencies to achieve closer coordination between the five snakes currencies and the four floating currencies.
He recommended the old serpent, but wanted to surround it with a kind of wider and more elastic "boa," which would include European currencies outside the queue.
This outer shell could have larger bandwidths than the snake and a possible option for currencies to exit and exit.
In December 1975, in its report on the European Union, the Belgian Prime Minister, Mr Tindemans, put forward a series of proposals to consolidate the serpent, which was to maintain a Community character and extend its action to the key economic and monetary policy areas.
Leo Tindemans believes that the strengthening of the serpent should also encourage the gradual return to greater international monetary stability, the first stage of which should be the creation of greater stability zones in the world in which exchange rates would be held stable.
This zone of destination for floating currencies should gradually move towards the snake as the weighting shifts in favor of the snake.
Some may see in the European Monetary System nothing more than an extended and redressed "snake."
As with the snake, membership of the EMS is voluntary.
While France, Italy, and Ireland decided to participate alongside the former snakes countries (br Germany, Denmark, and the Benelux countries), in 1978 the UK decided to remain outside the exchange rate mechanism, which constitutes the bulk of the EMS.
The obligations associated with participation are largely similar to those that existed within the queue: One currency may fluctuate by a maximum of 2.25% on both sides of their bilateral parity (for the Italian lira, however, this bandwidth is 6% at present).
- The gap between these two ECU rates serves as a basis for calculating the deviation indicator, which is a novelty of the EMS compared to the snake.
There has been a long discussion about whether the intervention obligation should be determined in relation to the ECU or using the parity grid, following the example of the snake.
However, Member States that did not belong to the "snake" in December 1978 (France, Italy and Ireland) had the option of choosing larger bandwidths of up to 6%.
- Internal monetary policy measures: These include in particular interest rate policies, which can directly affect capital movements and contribute to easing tensions, as experience with the "snake" has demonstrated to a large extent.
The mechanism of the deviation indicator has thus brought two important innovations to the snakes system: For the first time, there is an objective basis for conducting consultations between the competent authorities; this goes well beyond the purely basic agreement of consultations, which
Entry into force of the Basel Agreement, which introduces a system of reduced band widths in the EEC - the snake (bandwidths of 2.25%) in the tunnel (+ 2.25%).
The pound sterling, the Irish pound and the Danish Crown join the queue.
The Danish crown leaves the snake.
The Italian lira leaves the serpent.
The Norwegian and Swedish crown join the serpent.
The Swedish krona is leaving the serpent; the Danish and Norwegian crown are being devalued by 5% against the ewre.
Norway is leaving the queue.
Chapter II regroups these earlier attempts, from the formulation of a number of objectives in the Treaty of Rome to the concerted float of certain European currencies in the 'snake'.
Chapter III deals in detail with the content of the EMS and its mechanisms (exchange rate and intervention mechanism, role of the ECU, credit systems), in particular highlighting the innovations of these mechanisms compared to the 'snake' and the conditions for proper functioning.
During the start-up period of the system, the Member States that are not part of the queue may decide for a limited period of time to opt for some more bandwidths.
Two Community activities have so far been excluded from the scope of the ERE: The transactions of the European Monetary Cooperation Fund, which were denominated on ewre rates, a national unit of account based on the central rates of the snake currencies, and representative common agricultural policy.
The candidate countries also join the "snake."
The English and Irish pound are leaving the queue.

Mordillos KnollennUNK and the laughter against the suffering
Mordillo was, at times, one of the most widely published cartoonists, the boys of his characters are his trademark.
Also with 85 the Argentinean still draws and works on a film.
His message: Laugh, "because there is too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In his first years as an artist, he worked as a draftsman for greeting cards - frustrating him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York, and Paris, he made a breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: With the publication of his cartoons in Paris Match and then in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Time and again the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, circular Mordillo figures can be found in drawings with the sliding tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own figures, he is still in the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
His threatening figures continue to be widely spread throughout the world through calendars, puzzles, books for young and old alike, T-shirts, ploughs and watches.
For six years he has also worked on a cartoon film and a TV series with his characters.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand feet as an opponent.
For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D film, which is due to come to the cinema wall in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they will say, it's strange for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
This is why he is more inclined to focus on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced word-free.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to meet its commitments, France spends just 10 cents and means a comparable commitment.
Provence lavender threatened by climate change
He has become a symbol of Provence in the south of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is falling due to drought-like conditions and working age that is passing through disease, causing major headaches for scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed in recent years to the effects of climate change, which has caused much less rain in the spring.
This has an impact on the life span of lavender.
There is also a small Zikade, a micro-bacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "
And there is a lot at stake.
Lavender oil attracts not only tourists, but also perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant watches with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "
The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil, but also spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water, and the development of varieties capable of drought.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we have not yet achieved one or two more goals. "

The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
Riodoce weekly officials usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting the recent chaos in the Sinaloa state by organized crime, corrupt officials, and ceaseless drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They have been told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists are discussing what is more secure: To bring their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or to let them go home.
Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: Opponents, neutrals, allies.
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, enough perception and abdominal feeling.
There are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the government's pay list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who are making Mexico's chaos dangerous.
There is no respite from violence, and while corpses are accumulating throughout the country, there are more and more journalists: At least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, and five federal states were under threat.
Among the latter is her editor and inspiration of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez that shows his midfinger with the word "Justice" glasses hanging on the facade of the Riodoce building, two reporters wearing the 30 years.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special Federal Public Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings.
As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, journalists' murderers are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting and although the terrain is more traitarian now.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security is of little use, says Ibarra.
"It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we do not know why, we distrust everyone."
On the morning of May 15 Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.
He managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men, forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably because of the newspaper's name - the "twelften."
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, with rival factions struggling to fill the vacuum.
There is nothing to do with the fact that in Sinaloa, one or more people are shot on the street every day, or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.
Forget, for one minute, that there is a state of "calm" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state, with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was guilty of not protecting his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the release of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in war with Guzman's sons.
This release may have upset sons, suspected gangsters bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for its own security after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He was an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars of ownership.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without encountering the drug problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for its courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting surveys without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Award" for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the Committee's International Press Freedom Award for the Protection of Journalists for its courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV.
"You have to take on the job that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid.
I do not want to be asked: 'What did you do in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?'
The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun bird who could fly like a dockers, the friend who was generous with hugging and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guiabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his corruption?
His death has forced them, too, to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like to deal with their women, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best times, is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smacks wrong, it will stay away.
The anger is, said the publisher of Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative government smuggling routes is weak.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the space where Riodoce employees met for security training, mobile phones were suddenly not allowed, days before it became known that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were mandated by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Half in joke, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50% of the police officers that the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's issue, Riodoce has played on three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government expenditure, which focused on the home town of the Governor.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was needed when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: That the restaurant is a favourite local of drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost the whole century.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-profile corruption cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military assault.
Only a few months earlier, readers would have seen the Valdez column as the most informed source of the abduction.

Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organized crime, government officials involved in it, and an equal society.

Eide rejected all accusations, but he also said that Galbraith's accusations - which were fired - "undoubtedly damaged the mission, because there was already a great deal of skepticism about international interference in the election."

Dinosaurs used camouflage to escape his enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
Researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible rhino of a Canadian miners have been so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
It was so well received that they could even find that his scaly skin was reddish brown - and they said that it had had something of a "troubled past."
The report in the magazine "Current Biology" described it as "the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaurs in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurier, which lived in the middle of the chalk period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly well preserved state has been puzzled by researchers who describe it as "really remarkable."
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivores are the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rocks, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) heavy Earth clump.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you blink only a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.
"It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that, although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, this herbivores were probably threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-repulsion, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed him to mix better into his environment and escape from his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old Nodosaurier family made headlines for the first time in May and is now visible in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours discovering it carefully.
The amazing conservation of the Exemplar enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered the Contershading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although the debate is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure from meat-eating dinosaurs, that evolution encouraged the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most of the contemporary animals that use the entertainments - think of deer, zebra, or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, indicating that this nodosaurier has been subjected to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the chalk age must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal for information about his life, including his preserved content, to find out what he had eaten as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, ran into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"This Nodosaurier is truly remarkable because it is fully covered with preserved scaly skin, but also remains in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," said Brown.
"The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it was in the early chalk age.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it, and if you just look at it with your eyes, you might almost believe that it is sleeping. "
The chalk age was a time when huge theropodes, carnivorous dinosaurs, which stood on two legs, crossed the earth.
Although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long six tons of heavy monsters.
The scientists, whose latest findings are published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was plunged into the sea after death and masked in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the snout to the hips.
The creatures were, on average, about 18 feet (5 meters) long, weighing up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tips that raged from his shoulders.
Researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swung through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater equipment kept his armor in exquisite detail.
The hidden remains of this special Exemplars are so well preserved that the skin's treks still cover holprige tank plates along the dinosaur.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Hidden remains of the skin still cover the wooden armoured plates bearing the skull of the animal.

In the thunderstorm: Mass carambolage on A8: Many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.
There are many people injured, kilometres of traffic jams and gaffer.
On the highway Stuttgart-Munich (A8) about 20 people were injured at a mass ambolage on the late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police, at around 5 p.m. between the exit points Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg), almost 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, were joined together during a thunderstorm.
At first, no information was available on the exact number of injured.
They are minor to medium-severe injuries, said a police spokesman.
A large number of life-saving vehicles were at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich.

Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "comfort check-in"
It is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: Nothing unsuspecting is sitting in the train and sleeping.
Or you are deeper into his work and just have a brilliant idea.
And then: Puff.
Comes the conductor and arouses an ungentle or tear the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the complete ticket control.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and devalue your ticket.
Currently, a test operation is running on two routes.
"When the offer arrives, we extend it.
It is expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year, "said a train spokesman.
"Comfort Check-in" is the name of the train's ticket rating without conductor.
In order to be able to use them, however, some conditions need to be met: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to book an online ticket - which most passengers already do.
It is also necessary to use the train app that DB Navigator bought, which is the most convenient way to book your tickets.
Last but not least, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: You get into the train, call your ticket on "My Tickets."
The test customers will then receive a button for electronic devaluations.
The train crew will receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the train driver comes to Y when checking the ticket, he knows that there is a passenger with an online ticket that has already been paid off.
We can therefore continue to sleep, continue to work, remain silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: One for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should benefit passengers.
"If you want to travel without ticket control by our train crew, you simply check in the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to organise their travel time on the train more personally, "says Michael Peterson, DB's Marketing Board.
Second Plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."
People who often travel by train know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, the driving card controls are one of the biggest irritants.
Because often you do not have all the documents you need to validate online tickets yourself, but in any case one of your fellow travellers does not have all
Either the credit card or the identity card is missing or any other document you need to show.
The result is endless discussions between train crew and passenger, which leads to a bad mood in the section or in the greater area, delays in checking your own ticket, and finally gives conductors the time to deal with other issues.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.

How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On 9 August 2014, BUNK any Ferrell was shaken to its core.
Just a day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis buildings were sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment, which rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled over a post from someone from high school.
"The police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it is still on the street," it said.
Confused, because no one else posted the information on their feed, closed it Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly rescued on her timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was about to live tweets the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.
He poted an image of Brown's lifeless body, which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for them and their community.
She moved her mobile phone to return later in the evening to tweets about people on the Canfield-Drive.
There were photographs of the police band and people who cried, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father wearing a sign saying: "Ferguson police have just killed my unarmed son!"
She observed a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a bark dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman escaped his gun and cried: "I will kill you... animals all."
"This is not usual," Ferrell reminded himself of her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder to which we have become accustomed and which we can call typical."
At this moment I felt chills.
I was angry and wept. "
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she took her 6-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary, "WUNK Streets?," in cinemas starting from 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience that consists of the people who live in the community and who have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, wearing a flower dress and a matching crown, the two had a conversation that they had "about the black experience and the black state" many times before this morning.
"You remember, as I taught you, when black people have to fight for what they believe?" She remembered what she said.
"We are now going to Ferguson because the police have killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right.
I could not take her with me, "said Ferrell later.
"What happened today is a climax of what happened in the past.
She must know and see it and be brought up in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution, and what we must do to become free in order to free ourselves.
Although I am lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black woman child.
I feel I would be doing her a bad job of keeping them out of it. "
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was on the South Florissant Road, a place facing the police authority, which became a Campsite when activists were waiting for the possible non-prosecution of officer Darren.
There, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who had lunch.
They created pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly, a new type of activism for Ferrell's shape began to take shape.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has come. "
Weeks later, Ferrell met one of the film's co-directors during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said that she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted "document" what happened.
One question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit?"
This skepticism has been fed by countless cases of people, often white people, in a community that has benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan said recently in an interview: 'We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently'.
Folayan had already worked with the co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around Todestrakt inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, and together with six other locals, he followed the team of "WUNK Streets?" In the years following Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks to us or speaks to us," said Davis.
"This was the main thing for me as these people are presented, because that is how I will be presented."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrel's experience - to show that the movement "was not a Messiah leader, but a community that came together," FolayUNK said.
As a result, documents of "WUNK Streets" show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understand that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement who, after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, marked the film "BlackLivesMatter" in social media identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have taken the movement as a whole," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything. "
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women."
She insists, however, that "this is not an affirmatic type of action," in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film due to her identity.
"She was the person who rocked this energy," she said.
"It is no coincidence, although she was in the front line, because in a life at these crossroads as a black gay woman so much is at stake.
You can feel your energy through the screen. "
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial links between the community and the police continue.
Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway at a demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area that it calls its home: "Chaos."
However, she is clinging to a musical and she feels committed to this memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains. "
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
"Not at the front, otherwise we, and not all yellow caps on the same benches, are blocking in the room!"
"Very little space has remained in the possession of the city and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it was setting up a small new road and a new seat for a café to which the company would like to rent out space.
Thanks to a camera and a map system, this' receptionist 'can see how many people are in the room, who they are, and even remember how they were dressed, understand their conversation, listen to the keywords.
From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss bit gallery.
The bit gallery moves people, although it is not yet built.
But the idea of a shopping centre on the southern end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
The topic hardly leaves one.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."
While some say to the bit gallery: "This would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be real class" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "Do not need any man" (Siggi).
While supporters rely on a gallery to attract more customers to the city, which also benefits the rest of the shops, opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then be bluffed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the land where the farmer market hall is located, where 13 direct-marketing companies offer their products.
This will end with the start of construction work.
The Gallery-Macher wants to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Beda-Platz with possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying in the farmer's market hall for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the ladies of the land.
We have also discovered the butchery for us.
We would like to see a chance to keep this offer alive even during and, above all, after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities, this is also the case.
Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery, the amount of the rent depends on the amount of
But this is not likely to be very low in the new project. "
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping columns in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets, I find that superfluous.
There are enough of them in our town.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that we keep at least the market hall.
After all, the goods on offer there are fresh, most of them offered directly by the producer and are, on top of that, cheap.
As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are rented only by larger companies, because the rents there are often not acceptable to a retailer.
It is a pity that there are almost no more special deals, and what remains of them will probably disappear. "
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit together for me.
And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the farmer's market hall go during the period of construction?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long term, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the UNK Bit Gallery manage to sell all shops from Bitburg before? "
George Marquet: "This will simply not work.
And no one needs a shopping centre that is empty.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farm market, rather than this gallery.
But for a farmer's market hall, there is no room for pointless construction projects in Bitburg, thanks to the crazy number of them, I think.
If the farmers' market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again. "
A fitting similarity: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - hanging from the ceiling on cables.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts, sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former Intelligence Analyst served a 35-year sentence after making secret diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website public.
The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming Resemblance (A Beoming Resemblance).
She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science, and art, and Manning, a transwoman and groundbreaking dissident whose conviction was only transformed by Barack Obama.
Dewey-Hagborg has created through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and from which 30 portraits have been created how someone with these genomics data might look like a sharp interpretation of the terminology, even some intellectual commentary.
Manning, born as Bradley Edward, who has spoken openly about female identification since her puberty, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six breaches of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison her image was suppressed, so much so that there was only one photograph - a grained black-white Selfie in which Manning was visibly unwell sitting on a driver's seat and a platinblonde parrot.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette sleeves and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce an image of what these people might look like.
This was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she could not be visited at that time, and she could not be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked them if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned Muse became unequal briphew customers, who over two years exchanged several letters.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, "which foresaw a future in which President Cheltenham's judgment would be transformed and would be able to see the exhibition in person.
Indeed, the fact that Obama would demand Manning's release in a military prison in Kansas only a few days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy coincidence.
There is also now something low and heavy at the opening of the exhibition, because Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways, actually to fix the divisions.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a particular reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to "automatic fragmentation," the basis of which was gender, race, sexuality, and culture, with its overlarge signature (the "i" is attached).
On the opposite wall, her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how surprisingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all by including the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon).
"What people will hopefully take away from it is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work is.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that is 30 of these stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the comic novel mentioned above.
She shows Manning how she appears in her hand from the United States "disciplinary barracks like King-Kong with a free phone.
"When they cold your speech, they won," they say.
"So never stop talking."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who greets from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose goose when I talk about it."
Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own protestors.
This was also purposeful, as everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, man's statue), in which their genetic haplotic groups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind her liberation."
Professor of Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University for killing
A nationwide crowd hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee who is being sought as suspects after a man was stabbed with deadly injuries in a luxurious Chicago apartment.
On Monday, arrest warrants for murder were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau Cook, as shown.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.
A Community alert system published by the Chicago Police Authority states that the body was discovered on 27 July.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene, and detectives investigate the bull as murder, while the police actively look for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President for University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem had now been left out and had been excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal case under investigation by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A speaker from the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the UK police and ready to help the US investigation authorities in every possible way."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Authority, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged suspects to face up to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received an enigmatic tip saying that something had happened in flat 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said that it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
The management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents: "The police is currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way to return to those who made sacrifices.

"We will conclude the WADA Roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) are implemented for the restoration of Russia's Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada).
"At a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the Roadmap, Rusada has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect, "stated Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA's compliance roadmap, which describes the criteria for the re-establishment of Rusada and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that might give cause for concern to Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.
One of the criteria set out in the list, however, is that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA's investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
With regard to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programmes and we will not admit anything that does not exist. "
Mutkos's words were in agreement with those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
Talking to the Russian sales office rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally, "added Smirnov.
In November 2015, following the doping scandal, Rusada was excluded from the conduct of doping controls in Russia by WADA.
However, it has been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti-doping (UKAD).
Following a visit to Moscow in July by the head office of the organisation, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said that Rusada is "moving in the right direction" to

Such an agreement would have to allow the organisation, through its authorised suppliers, to satisfy the demand for low-enriched uranium as a nuclear fuel and, after processing spent fuel at market prices, to establish no guarantee of uninterrupted supply or supply of such equipment.
During the negotiations on such an agreement, countries should voluntarily face a temporary moratorium on the construction of further enrichment or reprocessing equipment, without giving up the right to build such facilities, given the non-proliferation treaty.
Scientific breakthroughs in biotechnology and the widespread existence of plants capable of producing biological agents limit the prospects for the elimination of biological weapons and make verification more difficult.

Every minute of the working day, another five people join the queue for unemployment benefits.
The fine-sounding concept of the common market does not mean much, is demonstrated every day by the long long long queues at the internal frontiers of the EC.
In the United Kingdom, this distribution took place under inhuman conditions, because pensioners had to queue up to get their free package of butter, as they did in the 1930s.
Logically, this causes inconvenience, because the queues of the non-French travellers - contrary to the idea of 'grandeur,' which probably inspired the civil servant who invented the system - are much longer than those of the nationals of the Member State concerned.
In addition, the veterinary service ensured that lorries transporting live animals or perishable food were checked outside the queue, that the animals were soaked and provided with veterinary care and that the delays were kept to a minimum.
In fact, some are seriously hampered by blocked roads, and I myself was more than irritated when I had to wait in a long queue before a military post.
For example, in the evening, voters standing at snakes of 1,000 metres were sent home because there was no electric light.
With regard to the number of Members of Parliament, I have seen long queues showing that they can use their card.

Part of a track that can be characterized by longitudinal markings and the wide enough ¡for a snake of motor vehicles, except motorcycles.
The carrying out of these inspections requires drivers of commercial vehicles to carry out extensive documentation and to wait in queues before the customs offices until they are in turn.
2,792 jobless workers are to be found in every vacant job in Sunderland, and more than half of the 1981 school leavers had not yet found a job than the 1982 school leavers had already entered the queue of job seekers.
This last point may seem superfluous today, but so soon after the "bad time," which lasted until the 1950s, every politician was the empty shelves in the bakeries, the food cards, and the long queues at the food shops.
In the UK, the practice is very different, in other words there are both real personal conversations and the so-called "cattle market," where teachers can sit at tables in the school hall and parents are queuing up for more words.
If adequate content is available, citizens would "prefer to work online" rather than standing in line, "said Liikanen CORDIS News.
At the end of 2000, however, the consumer who wanted to pay in euros often met with cashiers, who had to consult their superiors in order to pay out the payment while he himself was watching the impatient gaze of the queue.
That is why it is the snake.
The motto of "eGovernment" could be "better sitting on the computer than standing in the queue," because e-government is indeed intended to make it possible for public services to be delivered over the Internet so that we do not have to queue.
As a result, aircraft are often forced to take a long detour to reach their goal or "queue" to use the corridors.
The EU-funded project sculpteur opens up new ways to visit the major European galleries and museums, so that endless snakes and tired feet will soon be a thing of the past.
The process of completion must be streamlined and simplified so that long long long long queues do not hinder border traffic between Kaliningrad and neighbouring regions of Poland and Lithuania.
As a result, long snakes form on the winding coastal road leading to the village.
We are becoming increasingly aware of the loss of quality of life that we are suffering through traffic jams, waiting for queues and standing in front of closed shops, libraries and authorities.
The speech was not discussed with Obama, and a meeting had rejected it with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel at that time.

The start-ups that will help your company not to become the next resort.
Amy errett wanted to measure the luck of your e-commerce start-up with your employees, but the surveys did not work.
Responses were often vague, unhelpful, or, worse, fraudulent.

It has called people from outside for help.
A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is growing up to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee involvement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, address specific groups and demographic groups, allow employees to provide anonymity and complaint hotlines directly to executives, and in some cases whistleblowers.
"You now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit to track your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" Said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint.
He said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to snap surveys and surveys by certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so that you can emulate.
Companies come to realize that they must remain at the forefront of the workplace culture, so that you do not become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee describes a blog post that has been a nuisance environment.

Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view the heat maps of their problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And when the Chief Executive Officer is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion recorded the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convercent.
If a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, worker turnover and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has deployed Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to reach their headquarters.
In the past, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company's central office, file a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of staff.
Now that the company uses Convercent, problems previously hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practice - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience of employment," said Vitrano, who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Companies began to take ethics, values, and employee engagement more seriously in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took the "social media to get to their right," that companies recognized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge companies with recurring fees for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the agreement of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.
Glistening secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its total funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture, and venture capital.

Investors get returns when their portfolio companies run well, and companies run well when employees engage and are engaged.
If the third party analytics tools promise to increase the commitment and use of the employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, if a company asks staff for your feedback, it can have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change does not come quickly enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies relying too much on collecting data.
"Because if you do not follow employees will ask themselves," Do you really hear me?
Do you take care of this?
And who do you not care about it, why should I? "
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, he said.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems through the speed of decision making and the quality of communication.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is increasingly gaining new insights into its employees, and it hopes that in the long term, this will lead to a better binding of workers in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose companies.

It was a very grey day; a matter of sky hanging full of snow clouds blew over the landscape; then and when fell some snowflakes that remained on the frozen paths and bushes and trees.
Again I looked out; we passed over a church; I saw the low, wide tower sign up against the sky, its bells announced the quarter of an hour; then I saw a narrow series of lights on a hill; it was a hamlet.
Behind and above the summit, the celestial arch spread out, deep blue as at the dawn of the night; in the sky the breast image of a woman raged in as soft and unspecified colors as it was possible to put together.
Under this sky and above that summit a violent storm is blowing.
I love this day, I love this pale sky; I love this calm, this silence, this staring of the world in this frost.
In the kitchen, in the cellar hall, in the hall of the servants, in the large entrance hall, the same life - everywhere; in the salons there was only silence and peace when the blue sky and the magnificent swinging sky.
It was a warm, linder, but not a radiant, hot summer evening; the farm workers were busy along the way; the sky, though not cloudy, promised good weather for the days ahead; the clouds were clear.
I do not know if it was a beautiful, clear or stormy rainy day; when I went down the great road, I did not look up to the sky or down to the earth; my eyes were white with my heart.
It seemed to say: "My magnificent visions are wonderful, but I must not forget that they are absolutely endless." In my brain I carry a rosy sky and a green, flourishing Eden, but I know very well.

The NCAA eliminates two-day practices and makes a long day for Bruins
It starts at 11 pm, when a lot of UCLA footballers talk on one side of the team's new training fields on campus.
Some have pulled out their tricoons and show their backs full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team these days are a lunch break.
After the three-hour exercise, players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6: 30 the next morning.
"This is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of players, and has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the UCLA's first three courses should start at 19: 15 to meet the already packed schedule of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins moved the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras conducted six exercises in Westwood.
They will perform 18 exercises during August, 20 before the formal preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supported the rule change of the NCAA, even if they add another point to the multiple routes of the players.
"We place this enormous burden on them three or four days, and it is very challenging," Mora said.
"And they simply pushed it through, they continued to crack, they are great people.
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time, it will really be great. "
The UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished, which, given the clear visibility of its fields, will not light its use behind an adjacent car park and the adjacent Luskin Center, a superior-class hotel that has already been thrown a footballs.
Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," said Mora.
"This is a real problem and it is not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then prepare themselves to perform an exercise.
If you have the video and of an exercise, it is a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in car park 8.
We will do the best with what we have.
I am not, therefore, very concerned about this
We have a plan. "

She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "related article" and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a comic novel: A Castle in the History of England
In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970 "s and 1980" s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaarigen Yorkshireman.
"I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hands."
A Castle in England 'spans the period from the Middle Ages to Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: In 2014 he wrote 'Dead Men Without s Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found emotionally.
"I only reacted to the permanent print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700's who worked for the UNK iner," he says.
"This is his permanent impression!
And letters always smell for smoke, because at that time a fire was lit because of light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he were there.
Ach, I love archives! "
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest, I have a little overvalued my welcome!"
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, watching the archives, and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the painted hydesheads on the walls, and the bottles.
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and talked with landscape paths, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night he drank "Whiskey and began to write."
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only gained full access in 2006, when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees just started to look at the archive he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, put it on the attic. "
Diaries, letters from English Empire, maps that show who owned what: "One might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch fighting for the two families.
Guys, let everything go! "
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a base for discovering English history on a wider basis, including 'The labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle in 1381 in order to emerge.
"There is a record of a revolt that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly UNK es of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The farm uprising started in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Perhaps the two are interconnected? "
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle - such as' The Priest ', which tells the story of the Jesuit pater, which the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smupper', where the smugglers Arthur Darrell from the 18th century is depicted, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made years later).
The Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be pretty crooks, repeatedly making debts and spending money on things they could not afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by married rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking boys, with a talent to promote the inside. "
After finishing his work at the castle, Rhodes is searching for other unique writing experiences.
He spent a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about EläUNK mäki, the site of an early 20th century sanatorium, which has since been claimed back by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like: "Ah, now I have to deal with my damned life again."

Ministry to clean up track for racetrack shuttle
Over the past few months, there have been many disputes about the future of the racing caravel - now it is about to happen very quickly.
Before the end of the year, it is planned to build on the rough route on which the tourist railway runs.
In order to ensure the long-term future of the racing slope, works on the track are expected to start this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau racetrack, the country is committed to this important link for tourism," declared Transport State Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
He estimated the cost of repairing the track to around EUR 2.5 million.
Of this amount, the country accounts for 75%.
The contract on the basis of which the shuttle will continue to be ordered by the country is currently being finalised, Sühl explained.
The Ministry and the Südthüringen Railway as operators already agree on the technical details.
"This means the road map, the vehicles used and the quality standards negotiated," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
This was intended to be the regular order of the RennUNK shuttle on December 2017.
The RennUNK-Shuttle is a train service between the railway stations Ilmenau and RennUNK, which is especially popular among tourists.
In recent months, a pilot operation has tested whether the track is used by a sufficient number of people to order it again in a regular manner in the future.
The route is also very poor in parts.

Appropriate measures must be taken to guarantee the rights of victims of crime: The right to submit and receive information; the guarantee of communication; participation in the procedure and access to free legal aid; the right to compensation by means of criminal law and privacy.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry about it.
Just when you thought that it could not become even more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots comes.
Yes, indeed.
Sex robots are a big thing at the moment.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and cofounder of FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, the shape of the chest warms, and the type of nails.
"People are making fun of them, but companies are delivering a lot of them, and we will see them much more often," said Mr Sharkey when he published his new report.
Modern sex pups have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions, achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customize" his robot according to his beliefs, choosing everything from the robot's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it will be even more worrying, because many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex pups have developed into robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot, developed by True Companion, with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy."
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible," warms the website of True Companion.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
In the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixated on conversation or she can be "in mood"!
There are many worrying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace true human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics that allusions to rape when one takes a step towards Frigid (this is called.
On his website True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxy?" Says the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and their increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men will, of course, not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes its growing popularity, they remain on the fringes of consumer culture for the time being.
But what leaks out of the peripheral areas can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are appearing at a time when women's rights are under threat worldwide, when there is a president in the White House who has boasted of sexually attacking women.
The most detergent aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid Method s Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphic images, the winding body and the broken eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.
The aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as possible from a technical point of view (albeit with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to imitate the movement of a real body.
But, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots are not real women.
You cannot separate yourself from your companion or just go away.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are bewildered slaves.

Trump's great achievement?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also divided small-scale families.
Around Christmas and UNK UNK fest, newspapers in the US gave advice on how to deal with Trump's chosen relatives "horror.
We are all supposed to make our filter bubbles burst.
Less attention has been paid to Trump's power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long worked with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship with whom she had fought for decades for politics, is suddenly and quite strange on the same side.
That is certainly a good thing about dining table, but it strikes me in another context that it also entails considerable risks.
Trump has strengthened the left, but his presidency's output has the strength to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the great possibility that his kittens will one day stop us.
But there is an even more terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans, "who suddenly appear to be the epitome of rationality relative to his standards.
I find myself affected today by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original comic version of the spine - the dog on the roof, which is 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked like the two criminal).
If Trump goes, the Republican's next candidate must be only mentally healthy to qualify as immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest carousel in the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't.
The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crispy, and the animals rotate around to look beyond their own shoulders - extremely dark music and the climing.
So many clichés disappoint a city: The views of high buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite across the day when I discovered that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count in the north - but a big
However, the Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience, as two two two-year-old, one 11-year old and two women in the 40-year-old can go to it and all have a great time.
If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week in a department store, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could move my credit card.
In the cafe on the corner of my street, it is the same, plus the option to compare the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to introduce personality into a situation in which no one is required.
The poor woman at the department store was inexcusable while I was tired of having to offer her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pistorius has, for the second time, left the prison for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to hospital because of the treatment of cuts on his wrist, which, according to the prison authorities, he suffered after a fall in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by the prosecutors against a first dead pack.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nightly intruder who hid in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention this time to appeal against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius, from which they say that it is too lenient.
The National Public Prosecutor said that it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.

Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased prices in the "Napi" shopping cart by 15% compared to Christmas prices last year, while Tesco and Auchan have each increased by 18%.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price increase, and the price of daily consumer goods in hypermarkets increased by more than 30% in less than 20 months.

As Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberger schools, the four-school pupils from FUNK and Epfenhofen were laid off for their holidays and for secondary schools.
Three of the AbUNK UNK will go to high school in the future, four to the secondary school.
School manager Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the UNK haus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of the school leaving, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle growing up in the chicken farm but then released into freedom.
In addition, the mUNK Schar performed a musical entitled "Der Adler im UNK hof."
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg and let it breed from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken bag, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making him a chicken was shattered, the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain and escaped.
After that the classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the enema of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young gockles that wore cylinders to the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said schoolleader Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other kittens (chicks) but belongs to it.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His provision is to be free.
She wished every four pupils to feel at his new school.
Thanks were given to the former head of the school, Michael Müller, who repeatedly jumps in to teaching passports, and the parents' representatives.
The kitchen season is now over, according to school teacher Sophia Schumacher.
After two years of teaching, they are very reluctant to leave their students, because it was a really great time.
In the end, they were able to rely on the four-graders.
At the end all students gave a song of summer time and holiday time.
It was a great pleasure for children.
Eight first grade pupils have already been registered for the new school year.

Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal campings in Greece, informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of illegally camp people was arrested in Sithonia by the police, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day, they were released, while an investigation is under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported to bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened up control of the free campground and impose substantial fines on anyone found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry said that the Court could impose a fine.
First, because some young people would not benefit from these cheap cards anyway, because they would not listen to classical music at any price.

Software update for diesel vehicles: What stakeholders need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to take part in the campaign?
The most important questions and answers in the overview.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of approximately 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust performance of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and, in part, Euro 6.
Euro-4 diesel or worse diesel are excluded from this.
Anja Smetanin of ACE Auto Club Europe estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the software updates negotiated are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have cheating software," says Anja Smetanin.
The Federal Office of the German Federal Republic (KBA) has ordered their retrofitting.
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months, but have not yet given a precise date.
Daimler has announced that it will write to all interested parties.
If an inspection is due in any case, it will be done within the scope of the inspection.
How long will the overall upgrading take?
"Hard to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on political pressure.
"Because we have seen that car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the environment."
How long should the update take?
The retrofitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It may be more time-consuming to get a date.
What do motorists who do not drive cars from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises you to wait.
According to Smetanin, foreign producers would probably follow suit.
Is there a risk of a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars?
The ACE fears this.
But it is precisely in the regions where driving bans are at risk.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait for a sale.
Despite the progress made in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of contracting it.

Petrizki also lived in the camp with him.
Every few hours they took a bath, so it was high afternoon when they returned to the camp.
Everything in the camp was snatched, burning fire; for they were frivolous drivers, like all of them, and had not taken precautions against the rain.
All the means to be hot and tired were applied conscientiously, and gradually all the evaders returned to the camp, endowed with enough hunger and then began to destroy the good things.
Ll Cool J wins Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
President Trump's first award ceremony promises to be political.
One of the winners does not want to come - out of protest.
Ll Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the prestigious Kennedy Center awards.
As the cultural direction announced on Thursday, this year also includes singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman LeUNK.
The awards will be presented at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the ceremony with his wife Melania.
The winner Lear, who was announced with progressive TV series, has therefore already announced that he will not participate in the gala.
He said to the New York Times: "This presidency has chosen to neglect the arts and human rights completely - even to deprive them of the means - and that is a burden on me."
59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to make her point of view clear.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the US capital.

We make the city alive.
Roland Wacker, Haslach's urban builder, is retiring next year.
The post has already been advertised, but suitable candidates are scarce.
For 31 years, Wacker Stadtbaumeister has been a city builder.
And the work still gives him great fun, as he mediates in the press conversation.
He reports on varied but demanding tasks waiting for his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application has yet met the requirements profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.
For example, with due regard for the regular notice periods, there is still enough time to get in.
Since Haslach functions as a sub-legal authority for the administration of the administration, the applicant must present the corresponding qualifications.
The city wants to keep this function in any case.
If it were no longer able to fill it, citizens would have to travel to Offenburg for advice.
But bringing the city closer to its citizens is important, says Wacker, who reports on a good working climate and good mood between the public and the public.
In more than 30 years in office, some of the significant projects that Wacker is proud to see back on have been collected.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure about the building office and its staff.
But in the future too, varied projects are on the agenda: The transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz, for example, is underway.
The cinema bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, the stadium reconstruction is still a topic.
The latter alone will cost around EUR 1.5 million, "if we do it right," Wacker estimates.
"All in all, there are great tasks waiting for my successor.
The work here is fun. "
There is plenty of room for a city builder in design.
With Haslachs's own farm and fermentation shop, it is possible to react flexibly to many things.
"You can move a lot," said Wacker, and the design of green areas is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town is listed as an ensemble, it is important to "have an eye on what fits in," when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city builder emphasizes.
In any case, the city builder has a high responsibility.
He is a builder, "in the end everything is going over my table."
He can count on long-standing employees in the field of supervision and coordination: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been in the process for the past ten years, Manfred Schöner (UNK bau) has been working for 15 years.
Also, Wacker wants his successor to stay long, "We're looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the spot."
This is because continuity is important not only for a good working climate, but also for the further development of the city.
Anyone who wants to bury Roland Wacker should have completed a degree in engineering or Bachelor's degree in architecture, according to the city of Haslach, and have a good knowledge of planning and construction.
The town building office is subject to civil engineering, construction management, property management, municipal farm with building yard and town gardeners, as well as sub-civil building authority including monument protection.

Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help IBD (inflammatory diseases) to be used in the market.
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could be the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal cylinders.
The incurable state, which affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes gastries and vesicles, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Whereas those affected will usually be advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to tip their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells.
The chief researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol the intestine in order to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not enter the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, this may result in inflammatory disease.
Experiments have shown that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell is present in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their receptacles.
And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the cell appearance.
Professor Colonna said: "We have a link between a bacterium species - Lactobacillus repteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiom, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more Tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "
He suggested that the combination of L. UNK teri and a diet tolerant of Tryptophan promotes less inflammatory Darmmilieus, if the same system also hits humans.
The postdoctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe was separate.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the mice "Darmmikrobiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mice 'DNA-sequenced DNA DNA and six bacterial species were found, which were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing from the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that they lacked an Darmmikrobiom and did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were born the L. UNK teri and the immune cells.
In order to understand how the bacteria had an impact on the immune system, researchers L. UNK teri grew in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated by the mice.
The immune cells became tolerant cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as Indol 3 lactic acid.
If researchers double the number of tryptophan in mice "feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50%, but if the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. UNK teri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether Tryptophan by-products from L. UNK teri develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to Tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory inflammatory disease.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the ms.
Potentially high tryptophanvalues in the presence of L. UNK teri can lead to an expansion of this population. "
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed Nemanja Matic to a "genius."
At Manchester United signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfield player made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The 40 million pound of Chelsea signature began with a 2: 1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday, and impressed in the keeper's role as Paul.
Matic, however, was excluded from the preparation-Asia tour of the Blues and managed only 45 minutes what Mourinho admitted that he had to improve before the Premier League season began.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks soccer," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started in the Aviva stadium when Mourinho formed his start-XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted another three new commitments, but insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" to meet three of its four priority new commitments.
"Three out of four to get, thank you to the club," he added.
"I will be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they have taken a great deal of trouble.

New downfall for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
How the wind turns out: When Sigmar Gabriel was still the Social Democratic leader, before elections, social-democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with a degree of concern.
Just not a bonfire from the party's central office, just no headwind from the federation - that was the main wish of the campaign fighters.
This has changed radically since Martin Schulz led the party.
Since then, the members of the Willy Brandt-Haus have been watching with growing horror the events in the provincial capital of the SPD.
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with headwinds.
They were low-cost.
One by one.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of the Social Democrats and the Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-green simply cannot reliably govern," said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber of the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising outturn of a Green MEP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the country's election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and the FDP.
The Green Federal Chief Executive Michael UNK ner has asked Elke TUNK to give back his mandate to the secessionist Dutch Green MEP.
The transfer to the CDU means a clear distortion of the electorate's will.
Elke TUNK must immediately return her mandate, "said the German Federal Executive and campaign leader of the Greens to the editorial network Germany (RND).
"This must not be true," a SPD campaign sighs when on Friday morning the new message of hatred reaches the party's central office.
Stephan Weil, Lower Saxony's Social Democratic Party (SPD) prime minister, is elected to the CDU without a government majority after the transfer of the Green MEP Elke TUNK.
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD regional associations.
And nobody knows what will happen next.
The plight began with the unexpected clear defeat in the Saarland elections in March.

Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD governor, lost his nibus this weekend because he sat in the ElbphilUNK while his city burned.
And because, in crisis communication, he subsequently miscalculated everything that can be done wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
Now also Stephan Weil.
The Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been criticised for a long time because of the Volkswagen exhaust gases affair and his role on the Supervisory Board.
Miese survey figures were added.
Despite this, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil has been increasingly trying to focus on the Federal Government in recent weeks.
The ambition of the former mayor of Hannover to expand his power in Berlin was not concealed by comrades in the vicinity of Martin Schulz.
They allowed him to do so because they promised Weil to stabilize the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
In fact, Weil is not to blame for the party-internal dispute between the Greens in Lower Saxony.
And Schulz certainly not.
For the time being, the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed.
Their anger is directed at the Greens, and especially at the dissenters, TUNK.
"It is intolerable and anti-democratic, as Mrs TUNK puts her own career interests before the interests of all the others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the German Social Democratic Parliament's editorial network.
Mrs TUNK has not been elected to Parliament on the basis of her person as a direct candidate, but on the basis of the list of Greens in Lower Saxony, according to the Dutch MEP.
The logical consequence would be for them to give back their mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD-Bundestag, lamented an "undemocratic maneuver."
"The electorate's vow four years ago was clear: The people made Stephan Weil Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony Social Democratic Party as the top candidate in the parliamentary election, the RND.
"Now a future CDU member's personal career distorts the election result," Oppermann continued.
He asked for information about the background.
I would like to know whether there has been more or whether there have been more far-reaching promises from the CDU Lower Saxony.

The third paragraph provides for application by the Commission.
However, the more important provision of Article 109j is contained in paragraph 4:
It refers to a passage in the solemn declaration made by the European Council in Stuttgart in June 1983 (paragraph 2.3.7. last paragraph):
At the end of the presentation, the following paragraph should be added:
However, paragraph 2 contains a third paragraph which reads as follows:
What does this third paragraph say?
The last paragraph of the amendment suggests that the work should be carried out mainly through research contracts and partly by the Commission's Biology Group in Ispra at the Joint Research Centre.
I would therefore ask you, Mr President, to have the first paragraph voted separately from the rest of the text.
Rule 14 (3), (4), (5) and (6) These paragraphs are to be replaced by the following
The explanations must be changed by adding the following paragraph:
The amendment to this paragraph requires hot water showers during working hours.
The explanatory statement on page 8 states, in the very last paragraph, that:
So either one amendment replaces everything - and that was the previous procedure - or the vote on each paragraph is taken individually.
However, it will amend this paragraph in such a way as to make it clear that tariffs must cover the airline's direct operating costs on the route concerned and that state aid granted under Article 93 of the Treaty will be deducted from the airline's costs.
I would ask the Commissioner to confirm to us that the Commission intends to carry out the investigation mentioned in the second paragraph.
That is why I would ask all of you here to look at the last paragraph of this resolution, in which we recommend a joint study to be carried out primarily by the Agriculture and Development Committee on all the new aspects arising from the introduction of new products
The last paragraph of Article 3 only takes up the right of initiative conferred on the Commission by the Treaties.
There is a paragraph in this agreement which says that the Council of Ministers should agree to plug the budget hole in 1984 and 1985.
As regards respect for human rights in the Community, the Council recalls that when the Treaties establishing the European Communities were ratified, the Member States approved the following paragraph of the preamble:
It attaches far too much importance to a subcommittee of the Senate, which does not have any power at all, and does not sufficiently deepen the issue in the other paragraph.
In the French version, the expression 'from the European Parliament' was missing, thus losing all its meaning to the paragraph which was discussed at great length in the Committee on Development and Cooperation.
A paragraph in the resolution tabled by Mr Herman and his party friends, on the other hand, requires a comment on our part: We are surprised that the Commission's proposals are seen as only in the short term.
We voted on the first paragraph of Rule 102 (a), but, as far as I remember, we did not vote effectively on the second paragraph.
It is clear that the House has adopted the first paragraph.
This paragraph was then voted out by a majority of the committee.
An amendment which I tabled and which was accepted by the majority of the House is recorded in the Minutes as being rejected, and finally recital NAV of the original resolution was miraculously transformed into a first paragraph of the main part.
In paragraph III of the last paragraph concerning the Committee on Budgets, the German text again appears to have the wrong translation.
This paragraph forget that the Baltic countries are currently part of the Soviet Federation, that their authorities and their peoples know this very well, as they also know, that the rhythm of reforms depends on the democratisation of the USSR.
I refer here to Article 14, second paragraph.
However, if we analyse this article, we can see that, according to its first paragraph, the Member States are endeavouring to promote improvements, particularly in the working environment.
Because of a misunderstanding, 16 members of my group voted against this paragraph and two abstained.
I realise, however, that this would not have had any impact on the final outcome, since the paragraph was rejected by a majority of 55 votes.
Can the Commission say whether it has presented a report on progress in ensuring social protection, as provided for in paragraph 2 of Recommendation 85 / 308 / EEC (x) on the social protection of voluntary aid workers?
You are no doubt aware that the first paragraph of Article 146 of the EEC Treaty is in its current version: 'The Council consists of representatives of the Member States.
Firstly, will the Commission accept this amendment, namely the abolition of the second paragraph of Article 6?
Because, Mr President, in every paragraph it mentions the issues of the Kurdish issue, the Cyprus problem, torture, freedom of the press and trade union freedoms in Turkey, which means that there are problems.
Secondly, it is true that the first paragraph of Article J4 of the Maastricht Treaty states: 'The common foreign and security policy covers all issues relating to the security of the European Union, including, in the longer term, the establishment of a common defence policy.
I therefore hope that the Commissioner will discuss Christmas with his colleagues and ask them to come forward with my paragraph in the resolution in the new year.
This week in the European Parliament, we discussed, among other things, the Barzanti report, in which the following paragraph summarises the opinion of many Members of Parliament

Aid for the centre of the city III
Anyone who wants to clean up his house, which has been run over the years, will soon be able to get support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG urban development informed in UNK gen on Wednesday.
At the start of the information event, Schindler once again gave an overview of what has happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been clean areas in sensitive areas.
At that time, in the rehabilitation area I between 1991 and 2004, the Land of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding.
In the redevelopment area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant still stood at 60%.
As far as Schindler is concerned, the renovation work so far is a "success project" - it is important, after all, to promote interior development and not only to open up new areas of construction.
On 4 April, information was received from the Regional Bureau of Karlsruhe that there will be a remediation area III.
EUR 833 333 of which EUR 500 000 would come from the country and the rest would be sensitive to the municipality.
What is the development of a clean-up area?
One would, he continued, investigate where the "really old" houses are.
But it is also important to assess whether there is any interest in the planned area.
If necessary, the territorial limits could also be shifted again.
STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-Länder programme "Social City," in which the remediation would then be carried out.
The programme focuses on the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be implemented by means of object-related measures, that is to say per piece of land.
The renovation area would then be finally laid down as a statute.
The allocation period for the funding will continue to run from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
However, by September of this year, the inventory would be carried out to fill out a questionnaire to the people involved in the remediation area.
As far as possible, the decision on the articles of association is to be taken in November or December with a view to starting the renovation work next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out these preliminary investigations.
The aim is to assess the problems of urban planning and to decide when it will be rehabilitated and to what extent.
A clean-up note will then be entered in the land register for the respective plot.
Pietzschmann himself will come back to sensitivities and get a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of stakeholders.
There will therefore be questionnaires which will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land sheet," which deals, among other things, with the building condition and the renovation plans.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and apartment sheet," information can be provided on the size, division and inhabitants of a living room.
The blue "operating sheet" must only be filled in if business premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire was not simultaneously an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of the funds works according to the "Greyhound" principle - first come, first served.
You cannot "reserve" funding for later on.
Finally, photos of the "UNK II" project were shown in order to make a remediation "tasty" to those present.
British inventors set themselves a microchip to come into their homes and cars with a handmotion.
A British inventor is the first in the country to have a microchip so that he can open his door, enter his office, and even start his car with a handmotion.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company BioTeq.
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthesisten in the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant process is carried out according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company would also like to change locks on houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip, all for a surcharge of £300 per castle.

The White House's advertising costs cost thousands of taxpayers
The White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military's accounts, which were left to the TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American building programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence, and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, manufactured in Connecticut, was issued next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin firecar and a Mississippi forklift truck.
The military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this, because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his commander, the deputy naval commander for aviation.
The news showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn at 3 p.m. on 17 July at 7 a.m. for the event, leaving the lawn between 18: 00 and 21: 00 this evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was to be delayed, a second team would be needed for the return flight due to the limitation of the hours of service.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time.
It was not clear from the TIME records that a second flight crew was eventually required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the rule.
"One question we asked was whether it was an infringement of the hatch act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds as if you are closed," the Deputy Commander replied.
The "Made in America" event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the President gave impetus to the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he suggested efforts to contain government regulations.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for travel.
But requesting your use only for a photo-OP is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February, when the presidential aircraft provided taxi services against the background of his first campaign rallye in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of news about the president's use.
"The White House is enthusiastic about the show" Made In America "- which shows products from all 50 states produced by American workers using American materials," said the White House's deputy press secretary, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights in the Washington and South Lawn areas to degrade the US president in the White House with precise penalty rates.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercises in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted in the training needs of flight crew for the month, a civil servant said.
Helicopter units also flew 11 hours this day for "Non-Presidency Support Missions."
The White House said that taxpayers took the burden on none of the other props presented at the event.
One speaker from Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not have any budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the US Department of Defense's Stundentarifen for the financial year 2017, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is $24.380 per flight hour.
The unit records the flight time of the aircraft more than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual costs of running the helicopter are far below this rate.
"Fixing the cost to taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for the refund rates is highly misleading," said Walters.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual budget."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and conclusion of the contract.
At that time, Sean Spicer, the former White House press officer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present this week things that are made in America," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I expect hundreds, if not thousands, of people to depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this. "
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire-fighter car.
In the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky's representatives and joked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said, "I have three of them."

How America can damage OMV
Donald Trump was not really happy when he signed the law to tighten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening.
"In his rush to enact the law," Congress has packaged a few "unconstitutional regulations," he said.
The response from Moscow, too, was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was ashamed of the US push.
After all, the proposal provides for punishing European companies that help Russians to build gas pipelines into the EU.
Investors from the local OMV, who together with other European companies co-finance the construction of the Russian Nord Stream 2 Baltic gas pipeline, have been similarly worried since then.
The threatening backdrop is enormous.
However, it is too early to assess the consequences, according to the oil company's official statement.

Role backwards: The city supplies 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the Kita lunch table again.
With regular contact points for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is rotated back in the urban crèches.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld takes over food supply in the urban children's day facilities (Kitas) again in its own hands.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of the Department of Youth Assistance, this is good news: "We have all been very pleased."
Cooking is also out of the house: A caterer takes over this task and supplies fresh, chilled dishes.
The town operates 46 day-care centres in the Krefeld area, in 44 children get a warm meal at lunchtime.
In the past year, 2800 children each sat at the tables, and demand is growing steadily.
"Meanwhile, not only children who are cared for 45 hours a week are eating at Kita at noon," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer also applies in 35-hour care if children stay until 2 pm."
46 part-time employees have kitchen services starting on 1 September: They warm up the food supplied, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, portionate the meal individually, give out the food, clean the kitchen.
"The employees are assigned to a Kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group institutions - determines the range of hours.
"The kitchen helpers are now firmly part of the Kita team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"In this way, they are much more integrated and it is easier for the authorities to implement educational concepts."
That is also what it is all about: Healthy eating and cooking lessons.
"The children should help prepare food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
Also for children.
"They have a known force in Kita, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - which has also been the task of the kitchen staff - will in future be done by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has in addition to improving the quality of kitchen performance the charm that it has proven to be the most economical press agency in comparison with the cost of ownership and outsourcing of the city.
And that, even though 46 part-time workers are rehired.
"But these hours do not matter so much for around 750 people in the educational sector," says Sonja Pommeranz.
He is also afraid, like many other project critics, that the intended size of the plant would increase traffic considerably: "There must be whole bus charges, so that this is calculated," says Schulz.

Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, President-in-Office of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will stand in the provincial Council elections, with three women standing for the role of Vice-President and more than 30% of newly registered voters.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the election process.

Haysom said that a strong role for women will reinforce Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered among a total of 3.6 million voters.

Men try to bait 13-year-old girls
Two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to deprive a 13-year-old girl.
According to information from the police, the men spoke to the 13-year-old who stayed with friends on the Kolpingstraße at about 2.55 p.m. because they wanted to use the girl's mobile phone.
The 13-year-old rejected the request and went on with their friends.
Then one of the perpetrators tried to grab the phone and the necklace of the girl, but this failed.
The duo escaped without prey.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.

GMB's concern about investments at McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union would like to verify with managers of McVitie, a biscuit maker, that it has a long-term obligation to produce at its factory in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said that the company had remained silent about the future of anti-rabies investments.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, which produces biscuits alongside other Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits.
McVities's owner, Pladis, said that he has invested more than £5 million in recent years.
He added that if their activities were to change, employees and trade union representatives would be "first experienced."
In a letter to the company's subsidiary management, GMB Scotland McVitie Serbia asked it "to raise concerns that financing for the modernisation of production lines would not be pushed forward."
GMB Senior Organisator Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot obtain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of UNK cross affects our members deeply.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is heavily concentrated on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, from the perspective of jobs, wages, and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising living costs, and chronic output decline, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVibeans. "
One spokeswoman from Pladis said: "Only yesterday, GMB Scotland sent a letter to the UNK cross department manager, and the company will respond directly to it, as we appreciate the continued commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives on UNK cross, where some issues were discussed openly.
We discussed with our employees that, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain business climate, we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our businesses and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in our anti-rabies location, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of UNK cross as a production facility and, if our operations change at the site, the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to learn about it. "
"My uncle Reed is in heaven and can see everything you do and say; and my father and mother also; they know that you are locking me all day and that you only wish I was dead."
Only two or three days ago I buried a little child of five years - a good child whose soul is now in heaven.
"Let your light shine in front of the people that they see your good works and praise your father in heaven."
And then my soul made the first serious effort to understand what one had put in relation to heaven and hell in them; for the first time I looked around me and saw before me, beyond me, nothing more terrible to dive into the abyss.
"So you are sure, Helen, that there is something called heaven; and that our souls will go there when we die?"
› To shoot it to the fourth finger of my left hand and I belong to you and you belong to me; and we shall leave this earth and search for our heaven over there.
She was close, and since I sent no request to heaven to avert her from me - since I had neither folded my hands, bow down or moved my lips - she went on: In great heavy waves.

There is no doubt that St. John would have given the world that he could have followed it, recalled it, reserve it if she left it, but he did not want to give up any atom of his aspiration to eternal heaven; he wanted to.

He deplored him, but then he declared that in some respect the sick must rejoice, for it was the will that gave him the opportunity to reconcile himself with heaven.
The hands folded, she raised the head and looked up to the sky.
Thanks to the sky, he had survived this trip happily and had arrived in Rome without accident.
It is the sky. "
Sehet, upon a sign coming from heaven - because the sun is there - at once shake up these thousand churches.
This young, mother and mother-tongue brother, this little child, which suddenly fell into his arms from heaven, made a new man from him.
At the points where these currents crop up in the sky, they produce the light; at their cutting points on earth they produce the gold...
The creature that stood in front of my eyes possessed the superhuman beauty that can only come from heaven or hell.
She turned her oiled and dry eyes to the sky, to the sun, to the silver clouds that had broken up here and there from deep blue ticks and trapets, then struck a scream to the houses, looked upon.
It is one of the wise ways of dignified death that has waned throughout his life: A death that does not express meat and not fish, like the spirit of real skeptic, a death that puts the sky in the middle of heaven.
The beggars screamed, loaned, cursed and rose up; and Quasimodo, who felt powerless against so many enemies, for whom Gypsy was trembling and saw the wonders of his angry faces approaching ever more.
You will find it in the sky. "
As for Quasimodo, who had not stopped fighting for a moment, he fell when he saw this wild flight, down on both knees, raising hands to the sky, then stormed with joy, by defending the cells.
Sometimes he looked at a kind of thin plate with confused eyes, which was formed ten feet deeper from the niceties of the StUNK erathen, and he asked the sky, basically his changed heart, to decide that it should be extended to him.

Of these he knew no other than Enoch, who was caught alive in the sky.
Shortly before, he had known all the names, but now he had forgotten them altogether, notably because Henoch was his favorite form from all the Old Testament, and now in his head he moved to the outer sky of the living Enoch.
In Moscow, Alexei Alexandrovich's slowness and indecision, her association, put all the burden on him.
A heavy thunder came rolling and sprawling down from the sky and lost in dull grooves in the distance.
Did the PSG Barcelona warn Neymar three years ago?
The side of La League may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will continue its persecution of Neymar after making an offer of £189 million to trigger its release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the world order invasion?
The sensational approach has fueled the transfer window in the summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, with Paul Pogba Manchester returning to £89 million last season.
Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world, and PSG will offer wages of more than GBP 500,000 a week.
Barcelona is furious at the way Neymar forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan board insists that the club has always done its best to get him out of Santos since 2013.
But was the world of football warned three years ago by the PSG president of this prospect?
When Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned every club that wanted to have one of the best players signed by PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players, then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, this will have consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in the PSG midfield player Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its offers for Neymar.

A course entitled "Racism and Xenophobia at Work" has been offered to three groups of local administration staff.
This course was aimed at staff with supervisory functions, workers of foreign origin and teachers of the nursing school.
The course should create a positive working environment and help prevent "cultural collisions," ensure that employees know more about each other, inform more about the political parties' agreements on immigration and refugee issues, and encourage work within the local action programmes.
This course addressed prejudice and hostile attitudes as a result of ignorance and provided an opportunity to engage in practice-oriented discussions on xenophobia and racism, with the aim of bringing about a long-term change in attitudes.

But we in the Socialist Group have too often had the impression that the Commission has sometimes gone off course imperceptibly, but always in a negative direction.

I would just like to say briefly that this morning, at my suggestion, the Commission adopted an interesting communication on this subject, one which, of course, maintains the budgetary stance, but which should at the same time identify a number of new opportunities for Europe.

Position at General Motors Overseas Corporation with responsibility for European sales, marketing, planning and trade relations.
History: The concept of tariff preferences is based on the recognition that it is particularly difficult for countries whose industry is still in the process of being developed, i.e. developing countries, to take root in the industrial markets and to increase their sales there.
Such a market structure attracts internationalization, because national oligopolies are looking for a stable internal market elsewhere to increase sales.
Price reductions if agreed sales figures are exceeded: In France automatic price reductions apply for products whose sales exceed the sales figures indicated in the original price calculation application considerably.
Furthermore, uniform EC standards make the European car industry an important competitive advantage over truck manufacturers outside the Community, since 57 countries are now adopting the EC standards in their national legislation, because they have recognised that they are also useful to their countries.
It seems important to me to note that all the companies in the European automotive industry have been selling in record years by the beginning of 1980, and that Japan's competition had long been on the move, including from the automobile industry in Europe.
It will increase competition within Europe because even the Member States of the Community, which have so far tried to ensure a restrictive attitude towards Japanese competition, will very soon find that European suppliers are seeking to enter the market of these countries in order to sell.
In view of the increase in milk supplies in the Community during 1982 and the corresponding increase in butter production, the Commission considers that two types of measures are needed in the short term, partly to ensure a reasonable sale of butter stocks, partly to increase.
As you know, the Community has fallen considerably behind in this area over the last ten years, as demonstrated by its paragraph, which was already modest at the time.
Both the Subcommittee on Technical Barriers to Trade and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs believe that the sound level of household appliances plays a role in sales and that this problem is solved by competition and market forces themselves, so there is no need for legislation.
The Community's consumer organisations, like the Socialist Group, have been tirelessly stressing for years that only a move away from sales and price guarantees and a move towards real structural policy can bring the road back on the right track.
Such an action would have enabled this country to artificially increase its sales on the world market in 1985, which would undoubtedly have exacerbated the already difficult situation in this market.
I am prepared to consider abolishing this at a time when we have reached a level of production which is acceptable for internal use and for sales.
Can the Commission say to what extent the sale of unleaded petrol has replaced the sale of leaded petrol in each Member State of the Community?

Contrary to the hopes of everyone, but also Norway's expressed expectations, sales on the Japanese market did not increase in 1995, and there has even been a slight decrease.
On the other hand, the Commission, through a prudent export policy, promotes the sale of Community rice in the internal market.
However, in view of the differences of opinion between the Member States as regards the promotion of sales on the internal market and, overall, the positions of the Member States on the sale or promotion of alcoholic beverages, I believe that we have a problem.
This initiative is all the more correct given that we already have assessments of campaigns to promote the marketing of olive oil and fibre flax - as Mr Fantuzzi also pointed out - whose sales in third countries have increased as a result of ad hoc support.
In this connection, I would like to stress that I consider the search for more paragraph mentioned in the Fantuzzi report to be positive.

In the Community, the sale of starch and its suppliers is supported by production aid when these products are used in sectors which are not subject to import protection, such as the chemical, pharmaceutical and paper industries.
The concept of tariff preferences is based on the recognition that it is particularly difficult for countries whose industry is still in the process of being developed, i.e. developing countries, to increase their sales on the markets of the industrialised countries.
In the Community's view, this system was at least partly the cause of the very sharp decline in recent Community motor vehicle exports to Greece, while suppliers of certain third countries were able to keep or even increase their sales.

The paragraph was distributed as follows (1984 estimate):
Sales to households in 1984, for their part, were based on the following zones: KWh / year
In 1984, sales on the public network were distributed as follows (preliminary results):
These associations, which are professional representatives subject to civil law, may, under the express condition that they do not make any profits (including in the form of refunds) to their members to distribute to their members, joint purchase or joint sale.
Without neglecting the important aspect of the supply of raw materials, a stronger focus on sales and market problems was therefore urgently needed.
The increase in sales of motor vehicles in 1994 led to a slight recovery in the production of the rubber industry, although production has still not reached the level of 1992 in value terms.
The fact that the large companies are weakened or even shut down also contributes to the lively development of small businesses and their share in sales in France by 10% between 1980 and 1988.
Since 1990, the volume of hard coal sales in the Community has fallen from 45 million tonnes to 40 million tonnes, with a decline of between 3% (UK) and 17% (Luxembourg) in each country

A decision under Article 86 required United Brands Company to end abusive behaviour in the sale of Chiquita bananas within the common market: Closure of the market as a result of the ban on differentiated selling of green bananas; refusal to allow the sale of bananas.
The main measures introduced in 1972 for the marketing of butter and skimmed milk powder surpluses have also been continued this year; in particular, butter has been made cheap to certain food industries and consumer groups.
However, the continuing poor economic situation in the second half of 1975 resulted in significant losses in the sale of coal and coke to thermal power plants and to the iron and steel industry.
The joint expert group set up following President Jenkins' visit to Tokyo in October 1977 will continue to examine in depth the conditions for access to the Japanese market for Community products in those sectors where sales could be increased.

Tunisia's industrial product sales focus heavily on clothing and, to a lesser extent, on spinnings (in 1979, more than 18% of all exports), partly due to the spectacular increase in "outward processing" from Community companies.
This could even lead, as is already the case with northern products, to the Community being forced out of established exporters on the world market by subsidised sales.
Morocco, in particular, succeeded in redistributing its sales from France and the Federal Republic to the Benelux countries and Scandinavia, and in particular the USSR and Saudi Arabia.
This solution should have the merit of creating a less open Community commitment than guarantees of revenue or guaranteed / sales on the Community's own markets.
Since, in most of these cases, employment has at least the same importance as the effects on the balance of payments, it would be better to guarantee sales of reduced quantities, but at higher (possibly intra-Community) prices than before.
The prohibition of minimum prices does not apply to the sale of books, newspapers and magazines or to goods and services subject to specific legislation setting minimum or fixed prices.
They constitute a crucial framework for market and development disparities for regional production and employment.
In the case of mineral raw materials such as copper, phosphate, iron ore, the ACP countries receive project aid when production and sales are at risk and export earnings are reduced as a result.
Overall concentration in the food production and processing sector is small compared to sales.
Of course, this programme is not a panacea for European agriculture: On a case-by-case basis, it can help to open up new outlets and income opportunities.
As long as the crisis continues, many people accuse themselves of protectionism on both sides; this accusation is being made by lobbies that run into obstacles in selling their products or fear that their market will be flooded by products that are no longer in place.
Dutch exports, which consist of a significant proportion (almost 30% in 1983) of commodities and precursors, sales of which are particularly sensitive to economic trends, could be stimulated, in particular, by the current stock formation.
This would be a considerable increase in volume, bearing in mind that the forecasts for sales on foreign markets amounted to 440 billion m3 in mid-1983.
Indeed, it is likely that demand for steel products will hardly increase, which is likely to result in a fairly slow increase in total exports, even though sales of new companies will develop dynamically.
While foreign sales of natural gas continued to decline compared to 1986, exports of finished goods were relatively buoyant, despite the sharp appreciation of the guild in 1986 and 1987.
As ministries continued to control commodity supply and prices, and guaranteed sales, most corporate executives seemed more interested in a good relationship with the apparatus than in demanding their newfound entrepreneurial freedom.

The police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
As a car came up to him on his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to evade and touted the control plan.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW was on the B 215 from Stolzenau towards Leese.
In the area of Stolzenau, a car came to him on his lane, so he had to move to the right.
The tour driver toured the main planks.
Damage to property was caused by the car.
The driver of the next car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a lorry and continued its journey without taking care of the road accident.
It may be good, according to the accident-stricken person, that the driver of the Mercef accident did not even notice the accident.
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the caused vehicle to contact the Commission at Stolzenau on tel. 05761 / 92060.
The lack of storage and transport capacity and organisational difficulties means that slurry must be "disposed of" on land at favourable geographical locations.
These bookstores place the publications of EUR-OP on a storefront or part of a storefront reserved for this purpose and must keep the main publications of EUR-OP permanently in stock; they must also have an online order system attached.
The decline in domestic consumption due to the economic crisis, the decline in workers' incomes due to unemployment and high inflation rates and the fall in exports of Greek wines have led to significant stocks in areas such as Crete, Santorini and others.
In addition to the 1981 harvest, 115 000 tonnes of the 1980 "s are still in stock which could not be sold.
Only one speaker spoke of the possibility that his own garden could become a storage site for radioactive waste.
We should be ashamed that we have huge quantities of milk and butter in our camps, while children are dying of hunger in the Third World.
It can, of course, also reject it at this stage, but this would only mean a postponement, because it is certain that the Council will have to reduce quotas and dismantle the camps.
However, the honourable Member's observation that 50 000 tonnes of last year's harvest are in stock must be contradicted.
If we continue with our set-aside programme, we will soon have 18 million tonnes in stock.
The Commission claims that stocks are too large, which is not true, because less than nine million tonnes of stocks, not even 6% of annual production, is not excessive, but let us put that aside.
After intervention purchases, we have stored 200 000 tonnes of butter, quite apart from the East German stocks, and by the end of this year these stocks will increase to around 270 000 tonnes.
The war will come to an end, and we will take stock in the camp of the winners and in the camp of the victors.
There are some 40 000 tonnes of salmon on stock which will soon be dumped on the world market.
According to press reports, in the Saronic Gulf, an old cargo ship was deployed, which eight years ago turned into a floating laboratory and into a storage for the oil-containing waste of ships passing by.
The offers must be addressed to the intervention centres, which have good warehouses and resale facilities.
And now we are told that the camps are too expensive.
Most of my group supports the rapporteur's amendment that military facilities or camps should fall within the scope of the directive.
The entire camp is divided into different rooms.
In principle, it should be possible for Germany, France or England to store their radioactive waste in a warehouse in Sweden.
The concentration of production capacity allows maximum economies of scale and results in the elimination of intermediate production, storage and handling locations, resulting in ball effects in production and distribution areas.
Up to the point of individualization, the number of warehouses is kept to a minimum, reducing the risk of storage, storage costs and running times.
Concrete applications include: Business people who want to retrieve their faxes and EPost from outside and without special equipment, sellers who want to check without terminal whether a given product is in the warehouse, and individuals who want to check their bank account.
Development of intelligent storage and handling systems to optimize product quality.
New developments in the field of biotechnology enable new approaches to reduce quality losses and to develop environmentally friendly storage and handling systems.

This service takes care of removals, storage (including storage in Overijse) as well as insurance and inventory.
This could not be achieved, however, as the negotiating conference was unable to resolve the differences on certain fundamental issues (in particular on the issue of the general size of the camp, its division between member states, the details of developing countries' participation).
The Council decided to increase the monthly increments for the 1981 / 82 marketing year by some 20% in order to take account of the evolution of storage and financing costs for cereals and of the need to ensure that stocks of cereals meet market needs
This increase, which applies to cereals, wheat and rye flour, wheat and fine wheat, has been granted in accordance with the objectives of the basic regulation on cereals and has not caused problems in the Community storage and financing costs for cereals.

While the staff working in the business premises need a lower level of qualification, those responsible for the storage management and data technology need a much higher level of education and training.
Stock changes can be determined either as a difference between the stock available at the end and the stock at the beginning of the reporting year, or as a difference between what was made in the course of the reporting year to the warehouse and what had gone.
It excludes port vehicles, seaports and tugboats, ferries, fishing vessels, dredging vessels, hydraulic works and ships used exclusively as warehouses, floating workshops, houseboats and recreational activities.
The rapid growth of final demand in some Member States over the course of the quarterly period has led to a decline in stocks in France (-1.2% of GDP) in the Netherlands (-1.0% of GDP), Denmark (-0.7% of GDP) and Sweden (-0.2).

As a result, a high degree of elasticity relative to the share of capital inflows in the assets can be a small adjustment of the stock.
Apart from losses caused by persistent storage, processing, and transport difficulties, supply will decline, because farmers, who seem to expect a further price increase following the increase in the state purchase prices in May 1990, hoard grain.
It appears that some of the pre-products and intermediate products that were partially removed in the spring are being replenished somewhat.
The development prospects for production remain positive, even if they deteriorate by one point (+ 5 compared to + 6) and thus reach their July level, undoubtedly related to slightly less favourable expectations regarding the size of the stocks + not sold.

The coal mine will be substantial in 1985 (in particular in the UK), but will be almost fully compensated by an increase in stocks in the UK power plants.
For example, at the end of August 1975, the Neunergemeinschaft was in stock with 960 000 tonnes of almost 1 Mill t (1974 322 000 t), although production declined by 2.4% compared to 1973 and the increase did not appear in 1975.
In recent years, shelf-life, storage and transport techniques for dairy products have been developed, distributed and cheaper to the extent that the non-regional supply of all dairy products is now practicable.
All goods stored in a particular room are transferred to security ("room security contract") or if items to be transferred from the warehouse are individually marked ("marking contracts").
However, the market can also be supported by more elastic measures, such as storage aid or distillation aid, withdrawal by producer groups and so on.
Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"
The ReUNK burger Domspatzen report on abuses relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the ReUNK burger Domspatzen continues to provide discussion.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the Reformed Movement "We are Church," declared after publication to the German Press Agency that he expects the Bishop of ReUNK burger UNK and today Gerhard Cardinal Ludwig Müller as well as the Cathedral Master Georg Ratzinger.
It would be of great benefit to the image of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger were to express their deep regret at their own omissions or their misperceptions of what was going on at the time.
The Vatican Chancellor, Osservatore Romano, criticised the use of "double standards" in the reporting of violence in the domes.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that they are "shameful and shameful acts" that must be punished and prevented in the future; but the "degree of media manipulation," according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evils is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to consider it normal," writes Scaraffia.
Princess Gloria von Thurn and UNK also said in an interview with the Bavarian Radio: "You are happy to go to the church and this is a found fresco."
She also pointed out that in her youth, "blows were a very normal educational tool" to deal with cheeky children, as I was. "
It would be unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports of abuses, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
The author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the book "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages), is quite wrong.
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he assesses the results of the final report.
What exactly does the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, appointed by the UNK um Regensburg with the Enlightenment, state?
A total of 547 ReUNK burger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen.
The final report refers to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, therefore, it can be said that the master master of Domkapellinger R. used forms of physical and psychological violence in many cases.
It was precisely in the case of high emotionality that the punishment for the pupils could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many other accused people, many victims have appreciated R. 's general humanity, and therefore in many cases even have positive memories with him, despite violence. "
In the interview Hesemann explains why in his opinion the final report on the abuse scandal at the ReUNK burger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was relieved.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of the exercise of violence against protected persons at the ReUNK burger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students highlight their "humanity."
On the other hand, he also appears as a UNK eriker and perfectionist, who often became more tangible when a dome phrase did not bring music to the top.
How do you, as his biographer, view this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble and read all 440 pages of a report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger actually appears in it.
He has just eight pages dedicated to him and is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The violence at the pre-school also occurred outside its sphere of influence.
At best, he could be accused of being too late or of not taking any initial suggestions seriously enough.
The DomspatzengyUNK sium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all those questioned as "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."
For example, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger has an excellent record, describing him as "warm-hearted," "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as a very good teacher.
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which has sometimes led to outbreaks of rage.
He himself admitted years ago that he could not only crack with chairs and throw the keyrings on the floor, but also put the ear-cheeks on the hair or ears, and he deeply regretted and deplored himself for this.
In order to save his honour, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widely used in the time in question, the 1960 "s and the 1970" s, both for parents and for teachers.
Do you also know such breeding methods?
Of course, I think all of us who were born before 1968.
I, too, experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared to what this report is about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the preschool violence, these are, of course, small-scale.
One wonders whether it has more to do with his reputation and his role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just fallen on him.
Many of those who have never understood him are still working diligently on the Bavarian Pope.
The truth, however, is that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger of all kinds!
A great deal has been reported in the media in connection with the report on abuse in the ReUNK burger Domspatzen.
Is Georg Ratzinger also accused of any involvement or complicity in sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Quite clearly no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claim to have entrusted themselves to the master of the cathedral.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," said one of the stakeholders representing the others, "I was very embarrassed."
The real problem in raising awareness of sexual abuse was, and still is, that most victims are silent.
If they did not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader, who would have been a professional colleague of the perpetrators.
How do the Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger's role in cases of abuse?
As Michael Hesemann put it: "Concerning sexual abuse... I see no case... in which he (Georg Ratzinger) of all people could have had timely knowledge and stopped the perpetrator.
I think it... also really absurd to assume that it is he... boys have opened up more urgently, more clearly or more, than to their parents, boarding schools, confidence teachers, etc.
That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "
For example, the report comes to the very clear conclusion that "the fact that pupils and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation."
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore exempt from any complicity.
Nor can he be accused of not having prevented him or brought him to the polls.
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these vile crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media there was much to read about "UNK texzessen" at the ReUNK burger Domspatzen.
The former cathedral master Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "UNK UNK."
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed up into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.
However, this is precisely what is in turn an abuse of the report.
There is a clear separation between the pre-school and the high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence and, let us say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, that is to say also from four decades when Georg Ratzinger was not the leader of the Domspatzen choir.
The whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were actually harassed and maltreated and suffered terribly, all of which occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhausen.
However, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only got the boys to face when they were already at the DomspatzengyUNK sium.
On that, as most witnesses emphasize, the topic "pre-school" was taboo.
One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What was different on the DomspatzengyUNK sium?
Michael Hesemann: There was already discipline, but no sadistic violence.
This also applies to Georg Ratzinger, who concludes that "many victims have appreciated R. 's general humanity and that in many cases, despite violence, they even associate positive memories with him."
At most, there is still the accusation that we have looked away.
But, despite all the efforts made, the report could only define two periods during which it was reported about pre-school conditions.
The first time in 1970 / 71, when he just started to establish himself and did not want to hear anything about what happened at a school in which he was not active and responsible (according to the witness), and then again in 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently hide his ears before the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because back in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the DomspatzengyUNK ums, which the report even reproduces.
In his report, he pointed out to him that "caning continues to be practised in the pre-school."
Even in view of the risk of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when there was legal clarity when caning sentences had long been banned in Bavaria as well.
Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as everyone knows.
It was also difficult for him to assess where the people concerned were perhaps exaggerated or dramatic and where the permitted limit had really been exceeded.
Nor can we say that he has always looked the other way.
That is simply not true.
Only in 1980 was caning officially abolished in schools in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and UNK claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to those days.
How do you see this?
Michael Hesemann: We historians talk about the "trap of anachronism," that is, the danger of judging the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess is right.
But this does not, of course, apply to sexual abuse, which was always abhorrent and not to what was committed at pre-school against innocent children's parlours, which goes far beyond the practice at the time.
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being dealt with.
At the same time, however, I must protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishing, that is to say, earrings and pulling on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970 "s.
When physical punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What image of his ReUNK burger Zeit did Georg Ratzinger give in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Did the subject of caning also come up for discussion?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book deals with the life of his brother Joseph, Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, the Domspatzen played only a minor role.
Nevertheless, I do not deny that he had a strict regiment there.
But this must also be said: Without this perfectionism, without calling for unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to transform the previously nationally known ReUNK burger DomUNK UNK in 1987 into an institution of world-class.
With biscuits and candies alone, you don't make recalcitrant boys big singers and you are faced with every success, no matter where you are, but always discipline, passion and self-wining.
What kind of man did you see Georg Ratzinger talking about her book?
Michael Hesemann: By working on the book and beyond, I got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and always as a wonderful, humorous, baseless, deeply believers and heart-good person, he could not imagine.
I regularly get to know how many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his establishment, keep in touch with him regularly, visit him, read him out - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.
So those who still do not forgive him for being strict with them are clearly in a minority.
Most of the Domspatzen are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music to them.
And that he was always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, sure, that may be - but also a amiable respecter to whom she still looks today and even devalues.
And please, again, let me make it quite clear that all that is being accused of them are educational methods that were on the agenda at the time.
We can be pleased that we have long since overcome this period.
But it is highly unjust to make a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother, a media scapegoat.
The bad intentions behind this are all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published does away with it.
Now the decency would finally make a 93-year-old man, who has earned a great deal of merit and would not have known the ReUNK burger Domspatzen outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany.
Despite all the difficulties and the lack of resources in carrying out these operations, I can say with satisfaction that last year we succeeded in significantly reducing the UN's involvement in Tajikistan and the Central African Republic.
