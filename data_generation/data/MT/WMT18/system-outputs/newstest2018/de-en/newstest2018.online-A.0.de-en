Munich 1856: Four cards that change your view of the city
A lunatic asylum, where young people are supposed to meet today.
A Gruftkapelle, where is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small gardeners manage the former reason of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories.
It sucks when maps are not up to date.
Anyone who has ever had to get upset because the auto-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlas, an offer of the Geoportal Bavaria of the state government, are anything but topical-but very enlightening.
Especially if you compare them with current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the distribution area of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century.
The Digital Bavaria Atlas is a patchwork carpet that is not recognized as such.
In the large map, more detailed maps, so-called urpositions leaves, were elaborated for cities and municipalities.
According to the Bavarian survey management, these were developed between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second coalition war with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a topographical survey of Bavaria-of course for military purposes.
Even if the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville of February 9, 1801: It was the present neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide map of Bavaria.
Elector Max IV Joseph drove the project further, founded the "topographical Bureau"-and thus the Bavarian survey management.
The urpositions sheet for Munich dates from the year 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian National Library like all others.
The comparison earlier/today is the most impressive example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is under Sendling, which appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated.
Sendling was incorporated 21 years after the card was created, i.e. 1877, as a Munich district.
Today, under Sendling is in the middle of the city.
The houses under Sendlings concentrate around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was first named 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria 1705.
Where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing but fields-at first glance: When zooming in, a more little card with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-written numbered pieces of parcels from the so-called "Uraufnahme" from which the property tax is derived Was.
Small plots do not occupy farmers anymore-but small gardeners of the plant "land in Sun".
A large green area is located north of under Sendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the Oktoberfest, was in the 19th century actually still a meadow-and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the ISAR, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the urpositions leaf, one reads in the area of the present district au-Haidhausen not only the street name "on the dough" or the hill "on the air"-but also in large letters "lunatic asylum".
Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with delusions.
There, 1858/59 was born the Munich district Lunatic Asylum "on the Auer airing".
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution-the psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Louis II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chaining of so-called lunatics.
In addition, he has forbidden the staff to use violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the museum Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.
For 280 patients was first place, later was expanded to 500 places.
At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient-the reason for the construction of the district Lunatic Asylum in Haar 1905.
The Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of the largest psychiatric hospitals in Germany, has been located there since 2006.
Young people are now meeting in the Munich Salesianum on the premises of the former Auer Anstalt.
The order acquired the 1920 building complex and converted it into a youth centre with training establishments.
To the West is the football field of the TSV München Ost, East houses from the 1980s.
In 2015 the children's House "Casa Don Bosco" was built, in architectural terms, to the original building of the Madhouse, which had been destroyed during the Second World War during bomb attacks.
The Marienplatz was listed at 1856 as the "main square", the Kaufinger Street was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The bombs of the Allies tore in December 1944 many holes in the city center.
A big one remained until today-at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small commercial buildings and a Gruftkapelle from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the work was done and on April 5, 2017, the groundbreaking for the second S-Bahn trunk line.
With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today-and fill the hole on the Marienhof.
He reports that the queues waiting in line on the security check always ask what the problem is and get the answer from the security officials "there is no problem".

I left the polling station at 17:00 a.m. and the snake was about one kilometer long.

Ahmad Shuja has uploaded a photo of Twitter on which people queue in a long line to receive their ticket.
At some polling places in Malawi, the queues were so long that people at the end of the queue could not see the polling station.

Usually there is an extra snake for the students.
"And they've closed the queue for the students, but it's important," Vicki continues, ignoring Arlet.
Civil rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Coloured has issued a warning to colored people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory politics and racist attacks of the state.
"The NAACP travel advisory for the state of Missouri, which is scheduled to enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and Missourianer to pay special attention when travelling through the state and to exercise extreme caution. Because a number of questionable, race-based incidents have been occurring in the entire state lately and are recorded here, "the group's opinion states.
A recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it more difficult for people to claim discrimination, and the prosecuting authorities of the state that are disproportionately targeting minorities, prompted the group to take the travel warning Out, said the NAACP.
"They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten up or killed, "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard."
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under dubious circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more gasoline during his journey through the state and was detained by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The Council also points to a recent report from the Office of the Prosecutor General of Missouri, which shows that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more often than whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends, and employees about what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be willing to bring bail money or let the relatives know that they are travelling through the state."
Missouri recorded hate crimes in the year 2015 100, according to the latest figures from the FBI's Hate crime Reporting program, which rank the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th place in the country.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws that oblige local law enforcement authorities to make people responsible for immigration violations Which, in the opinion of the ACLU, will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel alerts are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry to other countries, but lately, interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
In the northwest border province there are about 13 branch centres, and in the Balochistan there are 30 other camps, which are smaller, however.

Incidentally, this can also be criticized by the Lebanese government, which, with its refusal to let the deported Palestinians into the country, and also with its refusal to allow aid agencies access to the provisional camp, has no other Objective of exploiting the matter for political purposes to the detriment of Israel.
For several weeks, after the discovery of the camps, we discover the rapes.
This attention and financial support must also not be limited to the camps located in the territory of the community, but must also, if not above all, apply to the camps located in the rest of Europe.

Willow Fence Project is Elementary
The Fischerbacher Electric Fencing project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.
The CDU Bundestag deputies Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have made a picture on the spot.
In the right Grabenhof of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local association together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies met.
Markus Schwendemann initially granted insights into his company, in which he managed 55 acres of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, provided 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodated holiday guests in five apartments.
The "Black Forest Milk" is for him the alternative Vermarktungsweg for the milk of his cows, says Schwendemann.
On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
As he is also BLHV chairman of Fischer Bach, he described the willow Fence Project as "elementary importance".

Farmers should be supported at a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.
It is hoped that the afforestation of the land could be pulled out for quite a while.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how they are going to carry on their business," stressed the mayor.
Farmers are often criticised for their support
In the year 2013 a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced over the pasture fence promotion.
The open-keeping area is thus 40 hectares, which may not be reforested until at least 2023.
Half of the total cost of 71 500 euros was promoted by leader, and a quarter was carried by the municipality of Fischer Bach.
Thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers electric fencing.
"The big advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac emphasized: "You do a really good job, without farmers and rural women it does not work".
Peter Weiß also said: "The best food is produced here".
The Landscape Conservation Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state support of pasture fences.
The aim is to open up the Black Forest.
The prerequisite is the presence of a support backdrop designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be schlepperbewirtschaftbar (slope of more than 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Pasture Fence Project 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots that want to build just under 16 kilometers of fence.
The open-keeping area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.

Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of a regime change is when you begin to attack the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as well as any other-hence the carefully orchestrated overthrow of Saddam Hussein in the Firdos place in Baghdad in the year 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he made a symbolic axe in a heated quarrel with Jim Acosta of CNN on the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration with Statue of Liberty took.
To stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have lynched him if he did.
But he grasped their meaning, and in particular the meaning which was attributed to her when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.
When Miller Acosta insulted, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.
The poem to which they relate, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
Miller is factually correct, but as he himself formulated it is not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance with the startling words of Lazarus, the only one in which a State invites not only some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor,/your afflicted masses, who yearn to be free to Breathe,/The miserable waste of your rich shores. "
There was never a time when the "miserable trash" on our screens was better seen.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism-he made it clear that these people are not welcome in trumps USA.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict about the meaning of America.
Lazarus-and her friends who were committed to placing their words at the base after their death-knew very well that they were doing a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to show the links between French and American republicanism, portraying the feminine embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem The female figure is no longer abstract-she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of the Exiles.
The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativeism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change it long ago.
The great cry-throat Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was rather an early neoconservative, which brought the American flame into the Umnachtete World: "Lady Liberty Goes Ahead.
It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not enlighten the way to the United States. "
Quite unusual, Limbaugh here stumbled upon something.
The meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the viewpoint of perception.
The great imaginative deed of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, wretched, but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the decks of ships.
It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Your statue speaks to you the words of hope and welcome you need to hear.
And of course that's not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch shall not enlighten the way, but will ignite the hatred which is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team
The UK Athletics performance director, Neil Black, says that the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the world championship squad will "make a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which will start on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and that the United Kingdom's athletics must learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue to do it until we find out," said Black.
"I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
The Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done.
British Athletics: It has something to do with what you've done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant. "
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butch, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team to team captain.
"Eilidh is pretty humble.
Her captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.
"A number of athletes, no matter if they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought about naturally were great. "
The Commonwealth silver Medalist, who will compete in the 400-m hurdles at their fifth world championships, says it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven, reaching 1983 and 2015.
The medium-distance runner Muir leads this way and has set up five British and two European records last year.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch after a great season that included the victory in the British team trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scot in team Lee McConnell was.
The captain of the team says that she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the crew, but in some cases they will also be involved in the medals and finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for Me, "she added.
"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podiums.
As regards my speech as a captain?
Yes, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.
So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there. "
The decisive factor for the website was our desire to create an audio platform that provides a space for emerging talents from the most diverse areas of the region.
Overall, the EP supported the harmonisation proposals by a large majority, even if some of the victims of the parties and certain deviations from the usual policies in some Member States were called for, because it was clear that without Harmonisation of cost factors and legislation, it is not possible to achieve much progress towards greater freedom of movement.
The need for the benefits and gradual realisation of such a project must be recognised and felt by all, so that the Anstrungen and necessary victims are carried out on a voluntary basis.
But how can we demand these sacrifices from our peoples, our constituents, if the same voters read daily in the newspaper of such violations of human rights?
Nevertheless, I believe that farmers are prepared to make these short-term victims so that the health of the people can be improved in the long term.
Mr Berkhouwer has pointed out how bitter this is for the athletes who have sacrificed for years, deprived themselves of taking part in this event.
It is not a question of refusing to make a sacrifice, but of the temporal impossibility of returning to the constituency and coming back on time on Monday morning.
The hanged of Tunis have not died around otherwise if their victim triggers a legitimate charge against the regime of Bourguiba, this shoot of the so-called free world, and if they are a confirmation of the need to face human rights violations, where also Always you may seem to oppose.
They are certainly words that she has expressed with the feeling of a woman, a Democrat, an anti-fascist fighter who has known the victim.
This is testified by the dedication and sacrifices-including people-to whom some of the nine were prepared for this country and its people and are still willing to do so by placing troop contingents on the UN peacekeeping forces.
But it also means convincing others that, if necessary, we are prepared to make sacrifices for these values.
In view of this situation, it appears logical that, in return for the victims of milk producers, the fats of plant and maritime origin imported into the community at preferential conditions also Responsibility.
This also explains the heroic sacrifice of Bobby Sands, O'Hara, Hughes, MacCreesh and the late Joe MacDonnell, who died yesterday after sixty days of hunger strike, who supported the approval and support of Irish Catholics and a large part of the European and Global public opinion.
This is meant by the word ' sacrifice '.
Our imagination demands some sacrifices on the part of the rich.
The Olympic fighters from many countries, who bravely brought an immense personal sacrifice, also believed that the community would keep its promise.
The fact that we impose heavy sacrifices on ourselves is of no use if our competitors use them for their own growth.
And the success of the Camp David agreement shows that, for the first time in history, the military winners have brought material sacrifices for peace to come.
This action-that is to say-will demand great sacrifices from the population and workers, victims who must seem hateful to them if they do not quite obviously justify their justification in the efficiency of the facilities and a sufficient balance between The surplus and deficit of production and consumption per capita of each Member State.
Thirdly, we must take into account the great efforts and sacrifices that Luxembourg has brought to the restructuring of its steel industry since the beginning of the steel crisis, i.e. since 1975.
Enlargement would mean a dramatic threat to the Spanish fisheries sector, and even this victim could not prevent our production capacity from being significantly cut.
Considerable concerns have been raised about the fact that victims-because victims were finally required-would have to be brought to the same standard by farmers in all countries.
We make a very clear decision: we do not stand with our backs to the wall and do not need to impose new victims on small and medium-sized farmers; It's different, too.
The agriculture ministers were realistic, and I know that all our farmers will be prepared to make some sacrifices in order to promote the long-term viability and stability of the common agricultural policy.
The victims, however, must be distributed evenly among the Member States, and I strongly disagree with the fact that British farmers should be worse off than their European counterparts.
Considering that we must all participate equally in the happy and unpleasant events of the community, and that it now requires sacrifices if the economy is to be re-established, we accept the proposals for price increases in the Woltjer report.
The members of the EPP even go so far as to demand a fair distribution of the victims in the resolution they have signed with others.
We must also remember that, if the democratic parties of Europe had been vigilant and determined, this sacrifice would perhaps not have been necessary.
However, these efforts need to be continued for a while, otherwise all the sacrifices that have already been made above all in the workplace would have been pointless.
A civilized state must avoid the victim of the uninvolved.
The economic losses, the number of human victims in the fight against fire, the costs are so high that they can no longer be carried by individuals, by the Autonomous Communities, by the municipal and municipal authorities, and thus to serious Economic shocks.
Of course, the aforementioned reduction has affected several important parts of the programme, including, above all, research in the field of aviation.
Therefore, it would be unfair to commemorate only one part of the victims and leave the other part unmentioned.
Now everyone who has a bit of common sense knows that one must be able to compromise and make sacrifices if one lives together to twelve.
Through this sacrifice, they managed effectively to stir up the international conscience and to trigger a wave of solidarity with the Afghan people, which is now culminating in this victory.
But in the name of what goal are all these great efforts, all these upheavals, all these sacrifices demanded of us?
In line with these efforts, producers outside the community should make similar sacrifices if they want to create a more stable balance on world markets.
The Polish people, who have been suffering for years from the shortage and scarcity of basic necessities, have just embarked on an ambitious process of reorganisation and economic reforms that will make further efforts and sacrifices for this courageous and patient people Be demanded.
The families of the employees of Sellafield are now being asked for an extreme sacrifice.
Only then will all the soldiers of Europe, whose blood as an invisible ornament for the victims of the past, have wetted the doorstep of every house in this area and soaked every plot in fields, meadows and gardens, only then will all these soldiers fallen in combat can rest in peace!
On the contrary, they would lead to greater social and national sacrifices, especially for the most vulnerable nations.
They have been working generation by generation and have made heavy sacrifices.
I will be told that every country must make sacrifices in order to build a well-organised, integrated and efficient community, both small and large.
Pakistan is a country that has already made great sacrifices in the Afghan war with the inclusion of millions of refugees.
Beyond these very general plans, we should not forget that there are special cases, such as the case of Poland, that, as a whole, the fact that the Poles were the first to initiate this process of democratisation and which were ready to do so, as far as was to make sacrifices has already become a demonstration object for what our world policy will look like and what our true intentions are.
Parliament is to approve measures that the United States is conciliatory, but which demand a great sacrifice for the European agricultural community.
The sinking of fishing boats by submarines can be avoided, and I urge the Commission and the Governments of the Member States to agree immediately on appropriate procedures to ensure that the team of " Antares "was the last victim that brought our fishermen to the Cold War.
We knew that war was the victim of politics.
I believe that the Council must pay attention to the fact that something is being done for the minorities that are left, even in a smaller Yugoslavia; In particular, the victims in Bosnia-Herzegovina also need attention.
The one-net rule proposed will impose different hardships and sacrifices on fishermen in different regions and waters, which will not be fair to the bank.
While this is a unique achievement in the history of international maritime transport (thanks to the self-sacrifice of the crew and the impeccable coordination of the rescue operations by the captain under exceptionally difficult Weather conditions There was not a single victim), the deliberate slander was guided by low motives of unfair competition.
We will all have to make sacrifices in our way of life, production and consumption.
Secondly, it is necessary to strengthen the principle of safety and environmental protection, to raise standards and European and international controls throughout the cycle, i.e. from shipbuilding to ports and shipping; This is crucial to halt the negative spiral that has led to ever more numerous and heavier accidents in recent years, and to prevent fierce competition, which is becoming more and more victims of quality and safety. Fall.
Therefore, both the authorities and the public in Morocco have used their connection with the community as an essential element in their internal political debate, because they have had the opportunity, so to speak, of their own people " Sell, "that it is necessary for a more stable and better future to take these victims.
I wish that governments would take an example of those people who show greater commitment and sacrifice in the face of such a human tragedy.
It is, however, a question of whether we have the means to implement our objectives and whether we have the courage to explain to our respective people which victims they must bring, so that we can use sufficient resources to achieve our objectives.
Of course, the necessary restructuring cannot lead us to selfishness, but we must assume a clear position on the part of the Commission so that the victims of the social partners and the investment efforts of the last few decades have not been in vain Be.
In my country, beef is the most important agricultural export item-no other product has that meaning-and because we export 80% of our entire beef production, the whole GATT issue has enormous weight for us, and it is quite certain That we must pay for it beyond the sacrifices that have already been brought in the cap.
The redevelopment of the market and the balance between supply and demand are to be examined in terms of production restrictions, even if this solution is difficult in view of the victims involved.

Blocking critics on Facebook: Apply not to be a public office if you can't tolerate the heating of voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it wasn't long before the newspapers beat him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
He scolded the critics, for sure.
But he did not silence his critics.
For in the year 1783 Washington said: "Freedom of speech can be taken away-and, dumb and dumb, we are led like the sheep to slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.
And that's why the American civil Liberties union sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a backlash with "Na, and?".
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state that is surprisingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary heat-headed.
He has shown a firm hand in guiding his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very adept at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents and to debut his bald head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of people who come to the governor's side-which is a public forum, which is called official and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars-is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people who swing the whip online.
The post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary section of the news program "The Post".
"I do not appreciate this idea either, if a number of people take a position on the same subject, some are disregarded by some rather as a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor's staff described as a "concentrated spam attack" would probably call others "intercession."
The Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past, if you had done the same thing, that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arrest and silence protesters.
But that's just what's happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable postage had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous scribes suggested his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that settled Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, Trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.
But he didn't silence you.
Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse are the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
A week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks declared that MUFG 9.9% of the Morgan Stanley common stock will buy at a single price of 25.25 dollars, resulting in a total sum of $3 billion.

MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will secure a 10% profit and can be resold at a price of 31.25 dollars.
The last few weeks have been tough for the group that had to look at how their stock market price fell by half, while the price of insurance against insolvency skyrocketed.

On the 17th, two dead women shrouded in blankets were discovered in the settlement Zoquiapan of the municipality of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning one found in Huixquilucan the corpse wrapped in a yellow-blue blanket of a man who, according to the message which his murderers left beside him , probably called Mario Ríos.
In view of the dense smog that burns in the throat and, on a few days, it lays like a blanket over China's larger cities, the improvement of air quality in China is one of the most pressing matters in terms of environmental protection.
He wants to say that they should invest more in innovative projects than those that offer "safe social returns" – for example, a certain number of blankets that are purchased with donations.

Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at the Renaissance club

Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50 birthday earlier this year, returns to the action on home soil.

An existing movement, which stirred up independence from the Dutch rule, quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In the year 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea encompassing the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabie and then a 5-hour car ride in the morning.
There is no public transport.
The town of about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated roofs, which have been transformed by rust into various yellow-brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee pago Papuan worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, pointing to her lively, hand-woven turban, her dark shirt and her bright skirt.
"In the past we only had leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesian gold.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran of Phoenix, is located only 60 miles from Paniai, a Highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In the year 2015, Freeport has mined gold and copper in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars.
In addition, Papua has wood resources worth an estimated 78 billion US dollars.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papua, which ensures that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
An investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars, including up to 150,000 dollars to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papuan tribal Highlands in the 1970 years were genocide in accordance with the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We will lose everything" is stated in a report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane from the year 2016, which contains reports of the atrocities of the previous year, such as illegal executions and torture-rape and electric shocks are according to another report Particularly popular-and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia's researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have intensified as Papuan resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the population-rich islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Warung-Canteens sell fried chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are struggling to keep up.
"Migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," explains Abeth you, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura to work.
"It has cost the natives of Papua-the Mama-mama [the women] of Papua-their market."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as JOKOWI, promised to address the inequalities and violations in Papua during his campaign 2014.
The former Carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua including Paniai-on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua little has changed, and today the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because we have voted 2014 for JOKOWI, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," says you.
In fact, Paniai suffered a low point only two months after Jokowis inauguration in October.
On December 7th, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas carols in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorbike.
The frightened kids told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offense at her tone and later came back with four soldiers, according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their rifle butts, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial Jagdbögen and performed the Waita dance-in a circle and imitating a birdsong-by Papuan Mee's Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators began to hurl stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," it says in an official document of time, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the imminent danger and called for peace and demanded the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he said time on the porch of his colourfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says that the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, lots of shots were fired," he added.
The native man Alfius Youw was met three times, so his cousin, who was witness of the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was," said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, bears only one name, the time in gloomy mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him. "
The chief inspector of the Papuan police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because they were attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the spokesman of the Papua Police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in the year 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many more injured.
The news of the killings came only the following day ' filtered ' to Jakarta.
Three weeks Jokowi held a passionate speech in Jayapura, in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to address the historical grievances in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it won't happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an out-of-court mechanism to resolve historical human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90 and early 2000 years.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations, but there are processes that need to be passed, "he said.
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke with time on June 5 in Jakarta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "Everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, accused by the UN for "crimes against humanity", which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody independence vote of 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been settled, Including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims took such claims with grim incredulity.
"I have been interviewed four times over the last three years, but there has been no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After burying the corpses, the military was looking for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drowned when he fished in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Agitated villagers protested before the company's location office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones at officers who reacted by firing warning shots.
But locals say that the Mobile Brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began to shoot the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panicked, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the wounded were quickly delivered here, according to the time.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and to withdraw the police mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai was always a riot cooker for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribal people of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in the Green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papuan Movement" (OPM), the rebel army, which claims to defend the rights of Papua by triggering sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in recent years, under the pretext of "securing national sovereignty."
Some never show up again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
The people here build everything they eat: especially Nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can work on four or five fields of the sweet potato.
They keep the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
In the course of time, economic inequalities have grown between the natives of Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nabi.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the more educated and prosperous migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to lead their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the Tribal Council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting international media remain tense.
At the beginning of the year the French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowis campaign to repeal the restrictions on reporting in order to promote transparency and development have not been realised.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia's troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: Visa denial and a black list," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbors of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states-Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands-called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shootout.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The spokesman of the Indonesian Foreign ministry Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the allegations of the group and told journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia, there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to find the evidence for To cover up human cases. "
The local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, under the direction of Human Rights Ambassador Kees van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, locals broke their silence and urged him "We want Freedom", according to a source that also participated in the meeting, But would like to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has 2019 another presidential election, but the Papua say that they probably will not vote again for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokowi to know that, apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predatory military, the Paniai people are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their vote for Jokowi as a "guilt" that he must repay.
"You don't need money, you just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai victims led a last symbolic act of defiance: the corpse of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they may never have justice, but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with his head bowed.
"What else can we do?"
Fire capturing the ' torch ' skyscraper of Dubai for the second time
A fire took place on Friday in one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 337-metre-high, 79-storied building.
It is the second fire that sweeps through the skyscraper in just two years, which is called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and yelling at the people.
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50 floor, "told a resident who stated his name as George, Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units at 4.00 pm local time (00.00 pm GMT) extinguished the fire and cooled down the building.
The government said they are working on providing accommodation for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of skyscrapers around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in the year 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the cladding, the exterior cladding for decoration or insulation.
In Britain, the police said they believe that the system of slabs for insulation and cladding at the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died.

No Davis Cup reform: next best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has fallen with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup singles only on two sets of winnings was not supported by the required two-thirds majority wafer.
The five-pack classics, which are often very long but also very much appreciated, remain the Traditionsbewerb.
63.54 percent of the member countries voted in favour of the reform, and the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was therefore scarcely missed.
"We respect this decision, but we are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical contests, "Haggerty said.

As is well known, the two players lost a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) time and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead his group, the two players will meet the prescribed sanction in the next league match against the Auxerre and thus enter the next game phase without any cards.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often found in the world of football.
The advantage is obviously that players will start the next game phase of the Champions League with no cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.

It did not even come to his mind to determine all the details in the state of the sick, to think about how this body lay under the ceiling, in which curved posture these emaciated were stored under the thighs and hips and this lean back, and whether It is not somehow possible to store them better, to do something so that the sick, if it does not actually do better, it does not have quite as bad.
The wheelbarrow was brought in, the body daraufgelegt, wrapped with a blanket and tied tightly with knitting.

More than 3 percent admitted that they knowingly carried objects with blades through security control, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they deliberately banned drugs on the plane would have brought.
The company said it had interviewed travellers across the country to find out how many accidentally smuggled goods were brought by airport security and how many had done so on purpose.
It is no surprise that the people who are most likely to carry contraband-knowingly or unwittingly-by safety, were the ones who fly most often.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are a bit complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure which liquids they can take with them or how much of them.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of items confiscated by TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought that TSA could look at books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk It doesn't matter: tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Electro-all Trades Elon Musk likes to give the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has thus far underestimated that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla boss Elon Musk has, for the first time in announcing the latest quarterly balance sheet, betrayed another less brilliant figure: the cancellations in the new Mass market Model 3.
In the past few months Musk had often advertised more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just starting.
Now Musk admits: from the total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn again.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In the case of a cancellation, Tesla will pay the 1000 euro (in the United States 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds) "Reservation deposit" completely back.
Currently there are 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk conceded in a conference call with analysts.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge of ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
2018 to be it-all models taken together-500,000, 2020 a million.
The demand for this is evident.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
If you order a "Model 3" today, you can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest-if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines, which have never been tested in practice, without major interruptions with maximum utilization.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are major delays, the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running in droves.
EPA chief Pruitt withdraws due to delaying the Obama era rules to reduce emissions
A day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, took back his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be responsive to the needs of the state's environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the action that had been brought against his previous post in a federal appeals court.
It is a deadline that expired on 1 October for States to comply with the standards of 2015 for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance for a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth."
Pruitt, who was a prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment by President Donald Trump, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations for a long time.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that resist the chemical industry and fossil fuel industry.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington decided that the EPO administrator had exceeded his authority when he tried to implement a rule of the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce Methane leaks obliged to delay.
In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that its turnaround in ozone standards would simply reinforce EPA's willingness to work with the States through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPO has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be accused of activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," said Pruitt, who was the EPA more than A dozen times in his previous job sued.
"We do not believe in the regulation of court proceedings and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority that exists to us seriously. "
Nevertheless, the EPO's opinion stated that Pruitt will eventually use its "power to delay and all other legal powers to ensure that the rules" are based on sound policies and the best available Information. "
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive recast of the ozone rules.
A draft law approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The reversal of the EPA--according to our lawsuits--is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," Schneiderman said.
In this case, New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems for sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives of public health and environmentalists cheered on Pruitts surprising change of course.
"It's troubling how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from being responsible for protecting the air that we inhale," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the ideological crusade of the Trump government, ingratiate to polluters and its special interests."
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt at a ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
An advisory committee of the industry, launched by the FAA to investigate this issue, recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic equipment.

Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the Jubilee of the Mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16th, is invited to a serenade at 16.30 am.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius Complex is a popular place to linger.
Visitors to the sixth benefit serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors Tumlingens to their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique village gem".
In the year 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first documented in the Württemberg Book of documents: Graf Hermann von Sulz sold "The mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and the bailiff" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 marks silver.
The wording of the document, in addition to the former parish church, on the Tumlinger Berg, was also a stately court, to which the church or the patronage law belonged, and not the other way around.
So there were people living there, too.
As can be seen from the description of the city of Freudenstadt of 1858, next to the Subvillage and the Oberdorf, which are now visible in the town of Tumlingen, the "mountain" is the third, the grand settlement core of the village.
Old maps from the period around the year 1600 substantiate these historical realities.
The patronage right arose from the early medieval church law.
A gentleman who built a church, endowed it and occupied it with a pastor, remained the owner of this church and was able to inherit this own church as well.
This involved the right to employ a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two is at Christmas 1673.
The newly purchased Bell was then resounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later in the Second World War in the year 1942.
In the Thirty Years ' War (1616 to 1648) the window panes were smashed and the bell ropes stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remnants of the church threatened to topple 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius Cemetery also served as the final resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823, the cemetery was expanded and the Hilariuskirche aborted.
Only the church tower was left standing.
In the New Year's Night 1834 a storm split the steeple and half plunged.
To prevent a disaster, the tower was demolished.
Only the Turmzwerg that still exists today remained as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the "Schaffigen pensioners" as a successor to Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius plant.
As organizers, the friends and patrons of Tumlingens on Sunday, July 16th, invite the sixth serenade to the old cemetery to St. Hilariuskapelle.
This is designed by the combo of the Kepler gymnasium Freudenstadt and with speeches by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local head Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 16.30 am.
Admission is from 15.30 pm.
At the end of the serenade, a drink takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows towards the forest", the organizers put out the fantastic view.
The serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius complex, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and patrons of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to home care, as serenade organizer Walter Martini affirms.
Association wants to have approval of wind turbines tested
"Boisheim fends off" does not see a legal requirement for construction and has therefore turned to the district administrator.
The association "Boisheim fends off" has asked the district administrator Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take back his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nice.
It is illegal.
The association argues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer nice no wind turbines could have been approved, because at the time in Vieren only at the city border to Schwalmtal a force concentration zone existed.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines is basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of the use of wind energy for the rest of the city.
Such zones are intended to prevent the landscape from being "asparagused".
The city of Vieren had decided a second wind energy concentration zone in the Boisheimer nette a few days earlier by a change of the zoning plan-which, however, had not approved the district government of Düsseldorf because of a formal error.
"Due to the lack of a planning legal requirement, the issued permit notification remains unlawful and therefore can also be withdrawn", said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim fends off".
Current state of affairs: Before the summer break the city council once again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer nett; Approval of the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "In this place, the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded from planning law".
The circle confirms the receipt of the call.
"The corresponding letters have been received by the Kreis Verviers since last week," explained a spokesman.
The circle takes them as an opportunity to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not expected to stop the procedure.
With regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the content of the argument of the association "Boisheim fends off".
The new RE, a subsidiary of the new, is planning on an area at the Boisheimer nette the construction of four 200 meters high wind turbines each.
Already last year, the company, in which the city of Vieren is indirectly involved, had concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare site.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity requirement of around 11 400 households is to be met-this corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity requirements of all Viersener households.
The new re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersens City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind farm Linnich near Aachen and a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
' It's ours, it's our future ', he added, after he had a theatrical pause to look at the huge map behind him.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of the association are therefore not merely the circumvention of legal hurdles that could arise in the course of registration in court-it is also a political strategy.

City and dealers plan "home shopping" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are expected to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on the 8th and 9th September to entice the locals to go shopping in the city centre.
As the chairman of the Trade association, Christian König, announced, the "Home shopping" weekend is intended to sensitize customers to what offers their own city has to offer away from the usual supermarket merchandise.
The plan is therefore a market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies are to present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city centre are to invite for "midnight shopping".
The action not only targets residents of the city and the surrounding region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags that point to the weekend of action, says Christian König.
The municipal administration and the trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
The trade association and the city are thus going into another stage of the project "attractive inner city".
This includes new offers such as the first "active day" for the Well festival including open Sunday, discussions with all traders and hosts to make them active.
Also attractive Saturday offers and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potentials are to be opened up anew or again.
This includes spa guests and tourists.
But also many locals lost sight of the city centre while shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to help to revive the city centre-to landlords, to the businesses of the whole city and to the companies.
It was to overcome the lethargy with a network that had partly spread, said King in the spring.
Birgit prank, head of the IHK Center in Mulhouse, has shared the fact that the third "home-shopping" day, which is the first of five Thuringian cities, is to take part in the nationwide.
In addition to bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities", said prank.
The action under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct environment with his buying behaviour.

Trump put on leaked transcripts of phone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
Transcripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by The Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US president insulted him because he had publicly denounced the wall. According to reports, he said to him, "You can't tell the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States, and vowed to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.

I was led to a tavern where the conductor asked me to sit down and eat; But since I had no appetite, he left me in a large room alone, at the two ends of which was a chimney; A chandelier hung from the ceiling, and at the top of the wall was a small, red gallery on which various musical instruments were located.
And all this you see with the glow of an oil lamp hanging down from the ceiling, and that of a bright chimney-fire, beside which I sit in cloak and hat; My sleeve and umbrella are on the table, and I am trying to recover from the warmth of the furnace from the stiffness and stunning that had caused a six zehnstündige journey in cold October weather with me; At four o'clock in the morning I had left Lowton and the Stadtuhr of Millcote was now hitting the eighth hour.
After I had walked along the long, carpeted gallery, I descended the shiny bare oak staircase; Then I came into the hall; Here I stood still for a minute; I looked at some copper engravings on the walls, even today I remember the same one, which represented a dark-looking man in a Küraß; The other a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace – a bronze lamp, which herabhinged from the ceiling, a large, old wall clock, whose housing made of oak wood was oddly carved and by the time turned black and shiny like ebony.
She climbed down from her chair and came to me to sit on my lap; Then she earnestly folded her little hands, threw back her curls, fixed her eyes on the ceiling of the room, and began to sing a melody from some opera.

The interior of the hut was as decayed as the old; Their walls whitewashed, the beams of the ceiling blackened, the chimney collapsed, Spinneweben hung at all corners; In the middle stood a series of non wobbly tables and broken stool, in which ashes sat a dirty child, and in the background a staircase or rather a wooden ladder, which led to a trap door in the ceiling.

He was particularly fond of hanging on top of the ceiling; It was quite different from lying on the floor; One breathed more freely; A slight swing went through the body; And in the almost happy dissipation in which Gregor was up there, it could happen that he let go of his own surprise and clapped on the ground.

Moore's Ford massacre: Activists lead racist Lynchakt as a call for justice again
A 1948-er Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled to the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white rider, could reach the bridge, a group of white men came out with guns to block his way.
The leader of the mob-a middle-aged man in a needle-striped suit-took a long train at his cigar and looked testing through the windshield.
Indoors, the occupants hovered in fear.
"We want this n----r Roger!" yelled the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
Cries torn the silence when a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Luckily, this horrible scene that was played on July 22nd is just a replay.
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience uttered very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have come back to Moore's Ford Bridge to mimic the night in which two black couples-Roger and Dorothy Malcolm as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey-were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in the year 1946.
No one was ever accused of murder.
"It's really incredible that no one person has been arrested in all these years--although we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the organization of the reposition.
"It's a speck of dirt on a story, but it's a burden to our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman from the state of Georgia and a life-long civil rights activist.
For him, the reposition serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want law enforcement, we want to end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he said.
"We cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice."
A coroner puts a sheet over the corpse of one of the victims of Moore-Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files received from NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process.
But no one was ever accused.
Although the suspects have been on the free foot for decades, civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city has always been known: Politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the pre-election campaign in the summer.
At about the same time as the election, according to the FBI, the Black farm tenant Roger Malcolm stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, down during a fight-supposedly due to a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the city was that Hester slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy, and that the baby she was wearing wasn't from her husband.
On July 25th, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid 600 dollars to release Malcolm from prison, the FBI said.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when they removed from prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement, which was not only involved in the murders, removed evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks formulated it even more succinctly.
"It was a suffrage massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community:" If you register and if you vote, then this will happen to you. "
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual reposition of Moore's Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their portrayal is vivid, poignant, and is rooted in a kind of deep racism, many of whom want to believe that he no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and even harder to look at, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about lynching, because then we are confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
The rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors-a dozen whites and the rest black-crowded into a room and listened when Greene started a well-recorded overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is a green co-director here.
He has played the role of Chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not so," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return to those times."
On the other side of the room, the actors D. Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who played Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcolm, who yells at Hester and harasses him, furious that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n---He disappeared from my property!"
Rascona responds to the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!" asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still giggling.
"I just don't think that white people---said it."
"Yet," quipped one of the other black actors.
"You just have to hit the hard ' R."
And that's where the energy shifts in space, a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are cries, gunshots and then silence.
A woman dressed with a mourning dress stands over the corpses of the actors and leads Billie holidays mourning praise "Strange Fruit".
Your voice breaks every second word.
About a hundred yards behind, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears out of their eyes.
The audience is almost equally divided between black and white.
A couple has travelled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just come down the street.
They have experienced Georgia's oppressive humidity for almost eight hours when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of Malcolm's and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you are in the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels spooky.
When the last notes of the song end, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpses.
Children crouch on their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," murmurs a little boy, as if to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd-and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw the Lynchseil away and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the Clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his teammates and then breaks down in their arms crying, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know that this is not in your heart.
You did that for a reason. "
Later, the audience will sit down with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chatted about the reposition with a black couple you've just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words, which feeling left the performance.
"It's hard to hear these horrible words and deeds... coming from people who look like themselves and who do that because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me makes me believe that lynching is still going on," she added, "Today this is called only police shootout."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks Hof holds his table, he eats and reminds of the civil rights.
He said he had already started planning the performance next year.
"The reposition is in some ways inspiring, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It is so, if we learn nothing from it, then it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, who do not know their own history, are doomed to repeat it. "
"Twilight of the Gods" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf is also putting on a colourful and frivolous staging in front of a gigantic, six-story backdrop.
The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) optionally shows a shabby street corner, including Mauerrest and kebab shop in Berlin, a "plastic and Elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes classic car is parked, in which the Rhine daughters pose as rocker girls, or alternatively a Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels remind of Castorf's leitmotif-money, power and greed-which is drawn by its "ring" staging.
The three Rhine daughters-sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner-harmonize wonderfully as in the "Rheingold".

The audience thanks the ensemble for their strong applause.
A stormy celebration is foster, milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who humbly and bows his hands to the Merkel diamond.
There is great applause for the Festival orchestra, which shows itself on stage for the first time-in view of the great heat again in casual leisure clothes.
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his production team was eagerly anticipated.
Had he had to pass a gellendes whistle concert about himself, five years later there were great cheers, in which the scattered "boo" cries went down.
Festival chief Katharina Wagner should have been happy about this.
"It is noticeable that the audience with the" ring "has grown together in some way," she said just before the performance of the DPA.
The audience had not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but also had an understanding of its perspective.
I prefer a positive summary.

Sufficient brightness, good contrast, flicker-free and anti-glare of the screen surface as well as high resolution and correct dimensioning of the characters are important for the legibility of the display.
The finer the resolution of the screen, i.e. the more "Pixels" are available per character, the better the legibility of the information.

Required configuration: PC with Pentium 100 MHz (minimum)-16 MB RAM (minimum)-CDROMLeser with 4x speed (minimum)-15 MB free hard disk space-Super screen VGA 256 color (resolution 640 χ 480) Windows 95.
Other databases with a higher resolution can be used within the case studies.
Among the international projects at regional and continental level are the CORINE and the CORINE PHARE projects at EEA, which, using TM recordings that achieve high resolution and accuracy, provide ground cover information for Europe Particularly noteworthy.
They do not contain full-resolution remote sensing images at this stage, although some samples of inferior quality are available.
The five basic properties that describe soil cover (wood-like, grass-like, bare soil, artificial (buildings), water) can easily be used with Earth observation data (both low and high resolution) over large areas for mapping purposes Be determined.
This option allowed the creation of a high-quality map base, with an expected geometric accuracy of 2.5 m (RMS) and a resolution of 1m.
In this case, with a geometric resolution of 1m, each point can be uniquely localized, with the exception of objects whose resolution would be less than 1 meter.
The above rule of thumb must be revised if the geometric resolution of the image is low, that is, if a considerable proportion of the objects whose surface you would like to estimate is set by the presence of mixed pixels.
On the other hand, there is still a lot of development and research work to be done in the field of Agrometeorologischen models and methods for vegetation monitoring with medium-resolution satellites.
Geostat's Geographic Information system currently contains not only raster and point data with a resolution of 1 ha, but also various vector files. In addition to project organisation and Management, the GEOSTAT project comprises two units: the Service Centre and the EDP group.
Integration, management and maintenance of various geocoded, spatially relevant data available in the Swiss Federal administration; This data is intended to capture the entire country and have a spatial resolution of 100 m, which corresponds to a map scale of 1:25 000;
Data on the area development of a smaller number of land use categories (possibly 20 or less) with a lower spatial resolution and accuracy could be published 1 or 2 times a year to close the data gap that That the area statistics can be created on the basis of aerial photographs only every 12 years.
Remote sensing provides the data according to geometrical meshes of different sizes depending on the resolution of the sensor (pixels).
In addition to the characteristic program, the scale and the geometric resolution (smallest difference in room unit), the nomenclature and the periodicity of the survey play a decisive role.
Regarding the selection of the sample fields, however, in the first investigation year 1990 showed that very small fields in the relatively low geometric resolution of the currently available image material (LANDSAT TM: 30 χ 30 m) in the satellite image barely visible can be made.
For the calculations, six of the seven spectral channels of the LANDSATAufnahmen of July 1990 and of April and July 1991 were first used; The thermal canal was excluded because of its low resolution (120 χ 120 m2), it caused too many mixed pixels on the plot boundaries.
However, the intended improvement of the spectral resolution in the LANDSAT 6 will in any case have a positive effect on the usability of smaller training fields.
For this reason, satellite images with a higher resolution (spot, 15 χ 15 m2) should be available as soon as possible; At the same time, it would be necessary to consider whether the inclusion of complementary statistical and/or meteorological parameters in correlation calculations could result in sufficiently high Bayesian and satisfactory confidence intervals in the yield estimation. .
The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry began 1987 with the support of the ITA consortium to use satellite data with high geometric and spectral resolution to carry out estimates of arable land and crop yields, which are measured by sample data from Land use surveys on 4 500 area segments of 50 and 100 hectares were added.
A first attempt to combine this survey with satellite data took place 1981 with a picture of Landsat MSS, but did not yield convincing results, which was attributed to the insufficient resolution of the sensor MSS.
It has also been found that for the regression estimation it is possible to use both soil data collected by points as well as segments, provided that one has a sufficient resolution satellite, where spot is better for this area of application Suitable as Landsat TM.
A finer spatial resolution is necessary in order to be able to investigate environmental impacts.
Different applications in different geographical areas require different resolution and accuracy when estimating the geophysical parameters.
For example, geostationary satellites can capture an area of one-fifth of the Earth's surface in thirty minutes and deliver images with a resolution of 5 or 2.5 km.
It mentions some of the problems encountered in the project, including the difficulty of obtaining consistent multitemporal data, the problem of developing a konsistenen and generally accepted classification, and the limitations of the Masstabs and Resolution of other data sets that need to combine land use data.

The resolution of REM is about 20 nm, the upper limit is at least 1000 microns.
The main obstacle to the classic picture-making is the bandwidth: with the conventional switched telephone lines it is still difficult to transfer a picture of good resolution with a sufficiently high refresh rate in order to really get the impression of movement Convey.
The frame catching device developed by IMEC provides a better resolution in the center of the image (according to the Fovea) than at its edge (retina), using a very limited number (8013) at pixels.
With the EISS browser, image material can be found and viewed at low resolution.
Equipped with the right signal converter, every TV device purchased today can receive digital programs, but not with the high resolution.

The Space Apphcations Institute, which is part of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission, has published a report on a new methodology for mapping Europe's forests using an advanced radiometer with very High resolution (Advanced very high resolution Radio meter, AVHRR).
The measuring instrument is based on the application of a supra-spectral sensor with a corresponding spatial resolution, which is potentially supplemented by an infra-red sensors with a lower resolution;
This will be the first time that such a "snapshot" of planet Earth has been put together in terms of resolution and coverage.
The themes of the projects presented were: opportunities to support the Altimetri on climate prediction, monitoring of marine pollution, use of Earth observation to assess the health of European forests, the PELCOM project, whose objective The creation of an "updatable" map of Europe with a resolution of 1 km is, evaluation of the impact of UV radiation and monitoring of ozone levels.

An advantage of empirical comparison to the Teoretischen determination of categories is that it is possible to determine their general applicability and reliability in the resolution of ambiguities in real texts.
The resolution again takes place in the source language; When translating into multiple languages at the same time, individual meanings can only be entered in these programs at certain points.
This could lead to an increase in the resolution of the ultrasound test.
For reasons of higher accuracy (greater resolution) in the simulation on the hybrid computer and the uniform standardization of the entire road for arbitrary schedules, the coefficients of the linearized rolling road model were calculated for setpoint deviations and multiplied by factors for amplitude standardization.
A full volume scanning with a high resolution radar device (like the one in Chilbolton) would take too long.
Of these data, the low resolution (10 s) were used only to examine long durations (greater than 32 s), while those with high resolution were used to describe the process as a whole.
The shortcomings that exist there, such as insufficient resolution and too long response times, are currently a major obstacle to the inclusion of certain innovation-relevant information in databases.
The research project of the IRSID (47) uses a new generation of X-ray radiation detectors with Fotodiodenzeile, which simultaneously capture a large number of measuring points with the same accuracy, but with a finer resolution than with already Existing measuring instruments.
The use of the new resolution, however, has the advantage that one can now recognize the differences of the surface temperature over the length of the streamed absorbers.
This model of price flexibility is dissolved by balancing supply and demand.
The resolution of the model causes us to set three marginal quotas.
The improvement of non-destructive methods with high spatial and temporal resolution, which characterise, for example, bioactive interfaces (structure, function, stability) and the design of miniaturized transducers for devices that are based on biological function Based.
The ability to pair high and low resolution images that were simultaneously recorded from the same platform allows for a much more accurate analysis.
A high-resolution zoom effect and the same spectral bands make it easier to describe virtually any image.
The radiometric resolution has been adapted to measure the differences in soil growth, not just the great contrasts that meteorologists need.
The JRC has developed a map of all the tropical forests of the Earth using the low-resolution (1 km) images of the National Océanographie and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 's American observation satellites.
This stocktaking was only possible due to several technological developments in the field of radar wave probes (microwave probes) with low spatial resolution.
The aim is to monitor the development of tropical forest areas almost simultaneously through the combined use of images with both low and high resolution.
The high-resolution images then allow the affected region to be analyzed in detail and the size of the existing forest areas to be precisely determined.
A new kind of sonar • In the area of marine technology and the acid (Acoustic imaging development) project, a new generation of sonars has been developed whose special feature is that they provide images whose resolution is independent of the distance Between the detector and the target object.
(resolution by the annual general meeting)
Scanning documents can save the contents of paper pages as a computer file that contains an image of the source document with a specific resolution.
The resolution of a scanner is expressed in dots per inch (dpi).
Color scanners can now easily reach a resolution of 300 or 600 dpi.
The resolution of a fax scanner is much lower (100 to 200 dpi).
Due to the low resolution and poor print quality, optical character recognition for faxes can often be difficult to apply.
Henning T. Rips two cables from the stereo system, knots them into a sling and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
It called on the governments in the region to commit themselves to sustainable land use and sustainable investments that are not at the expense of the natural resources of Southeast Asia – mainly forests.
Some investors seem to bet on safe investments such as gold.
For this reason, investors in Europe have an average of more than 34 percent short-term investments compared to 14 per cent in the USA.
For this, short-term investments in Europe are weighted more than twice as much.
Especially for small countries such as Switzerland, where the possibilities for the diversification of investments and the selection of securities are limited due to the size of the domestic capital market, the securities investment abroad is of great importance.
Over the past few years, the economy has benefited greatly from global demand for US assets, especially debt in the form of securities that financed a large current-account deficit.
The entire financial universe – investments and trade – has been increasingly covered for 100 years, as it is hardly in any other financial market:
In the past, in the case of sustainable investments, the main objective was to filter out investments in "poorly respected" sectors such as alcohol, arms and tobacco.
Such investments as well as investments or cash reserves form the active side.
What about the currency risk – should investments be hedged?
In a broad comparison, we therefore assume that the risk/return ratio of investments in the emerging markets will continue to improve.
The investment guru Jim Rogers once said that in an investment in the emerging markets, it would be best to buy what the emerging countries themselves buy, namely commodities.
A new era of sustainable investments
Initial approaches only included investments in "sin sectors" such as alcohol, weapons or tobacco.
At Credit Suisse, we define sustainable investment as the explicit recognition that environmental, social and governance factors can influence the ability of companies to generate long-term returns.
Our research methodology for sustainable investments begins with an analysis of the sustainability opportunities and risks that can fundamentally influence the ability of a company to secure its profitability.
Why do sustainable investments and sustainably managed companies find so much more public attention today than they were ten years ago?
Due to catastrophes such as Fukushima or Deepwater horizon, investors ask themselves how their investments affect the environment and society.
The market turmoil of recent times has also increased the importance of awareness of sustainable investments.
Do you assume that the trend towards sustainable investments remains limited to pure niche areas such as environmental technology, or will the consideration of ESG criteria be established by investors worldwide as a permanent trend?
We want to offer investors our know-how in the field of sustainable investments, play a visible and important role in this and at the same time participate in the steady growth in this area.
In the case of investment and banking products, the consulting process, the instruments we offer and, most importantly, our employees ", Pauli adds.
"Returns are important, no question," says Pauli, "but good advice, including a clear justification that speaks for or against an investment, is just as important."
"Investing has become a very complex affair," explains Nicole Pauli, "and at some point, product specialists are required to have specific, detailed knowledge of a plant."
For example, the asset management specialists for asset investments in funds and alternative investments, or the investment bankers for strategic decisions such as an IPO or a merger, and finally the private banking advisors for the Private wealth Management.
For example, value investing on Benjamin Graham and David Dodd and their 1934 published investment standard Work "security Analysis" (German:
Speaking to John Maynard Keynes, supporters of the Contrarian strategy have the following view: "A basic principle of investing is to stand up against the prevailing opinion, because if everyone agrees on the merits of an investment, this Inevitably too expensive and thus unattractive ".
On the one hand, the increased risk aversion in the face of the debt problems in Greece and Spain would be an escape to safe investments.
On the other hand, from the perspective of a foreign investor, an investment in Swiss francs would represent a diversification in the portfolio.
In addition, cash flows into indexed products are on a relatively illiquid market, forcing investors from passively managed mandates into investments at a return level, which we believe is not sustainable.
The true dimension was evident in the publication of the Bank's results for the third quarter of 2011: The new Basel III rules would have increased risk-weighted assets (or RWA) in investment banking to more than double, which Mainly attributable to fixed-income investments.
The lack of investment alternatives and the worldwide high liquidity in investors ' custody accounts also speak for an investment in equities.
One makes a decision (buys a plant) and hopes for a positive effect (wants to achieve a return).
It is a measure of the return fluctuations of a plant by its mean value.
Instruments with a very low risk, such as most money market investments, receive a one, very high-risk investment such as options, on the other hand, a five.
This is particularly important in view of the currently very unusual market environment for fixed income investments, which is characterised by exceptionally low returns and a lack of safe investments.
For investors who want to share the potential of the stock markets but are not prepared to bear all the risks involved, an investment in convertible bonds is an asset.
Many company founders are also looking for ways to convert part of their assets in the company into liquid funds and to diversify into unsecured and uncorrelated assets.
Long-term investments in the oil, mining, manufacturing and transport sectors are more stable than the investments in equities and bonds that are currently being deducted from other emerging markets.
Responsible investments offer new opportunities
For example, the first comprehensive investment report from seven regions around the world of the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance (GSIA) from the year 2013 notes that at least USD 13.6 trillion of professionally managed assets is now in the selection and management of their Plants also apply so-called ESG criteria (environmental, social and governance considerations, ecological, social and governance criteria) to the selection and management of their plants.
This represents around 22 per cent of the assets under management from these regions and shows that sustainable investments in the regions under investigation have reached a critical mass overall.
The final panel discussion dealt with the central topic of "impact investing", i.e. investments which, in addition to their financial return, have also generated social and/or ecological improvements, thanks to sustainable company growth.
With reference to the collapse of the Rana factory building in Bangladesh in April 2013, which, among the workers there, was calling for more than 1100 deaths and around 1000 severely injured, Oliver Maier explained that long-term investors such as Sovereign wealth funds, ultra high net worth individuals and pension institutions classify these types of investments as particularly attractive:
Responsible Investment (RI) or responsible investing is an investment approach that takes into account environmental, social and governance aspects ("environmental, social and governance (ESG) Considerations") in the choice and management of assets.
We have been able to obtain money quickly, especially for alternative investments, and now need to industrialize all processes – from marketing to sales.
Speaking of growth in alternative investments: What is this demand due to?
In my opinion, the AM is fulfilling these requirements with its first-class products in the field of alternative and traditional plants as well as its strong multi-asset class solutions business.
How do you ensure a solid investment and risk management process?
What does this mean in terms of attachments?
The new, handpicked investment themes and ideas from Credit Suisse's investment Strategy & research team have been developed to make the most of your investment in the second half of the year 2014.
Giles Keating, head of research, discusses the reflections behind the ideas and the impact of the plant.
"For example, European customers like to delegate their investments and often opt for asset management mandates.
The third factor could play a role, although we do not have any explicit state requirements regarding installations.
Life insurances such as pension funds, which have traditionally built heavily on fixed-income investments, face problems.
Given its risk profile and also the investment Guidelines (BVG), it will be difficult for these investors to increase their share of more risky investments such as equities or high-yield bonds.
This reduction in debt means that market participants will liquidate their emerging markets assets.
Today's stock exchanges are owned by shareholders who expect a reasonable return on investment for their investment.
The boom 2001 was triggered by a too low real estate offer, a significant employment growth, a expansionist monetary policy and the trend of private households to reallocate their investments of equities on residential real estate.
In addition to the classic direct investment, there is a whole range of alternatives to avoid the possible disadvantages of such a system, such as low liquidity and lack of transparency.
To put it simply, I decide whether we invest more in bonds, equities, cash or alternative investments, and on the allocation of various sub-asset categories such as loans, hedge funds or private equity, such as regions, countries and styles, such as VALUES (value stocks) or growth stocks.
Today it gives a number of ways to cover the megatrends of "demographic developments", "multipolar World" and "sustainability" with a single facility.
That would be the right environment for dealing intensively with installations that take these megatrends into account.
In fact, the investment in countries with weaker economic growth has achieved high returns in the past.
The primary investment issue for an investment in India is consumption, i.e. an investment in non-cyclical consumer goods, personal care products, electronic products, high demand goods such as cars and mobile phones or luxury goods.
For each profile it is stipulated in which band the bonds, the shares, the alternative investments and the currencies are allowed to move.
The American data provide an approximate idea of the possible yields of plants in agricultural land.
Investments in agricultural land would have been a good admixture for most depots over the last two decades.
Only the right harvest makes a good plant out of a noble wine.
The report also provides valuable data for the important top-down analysis of assets and maps current concerns on the market in terms of public debt to the right context: it proves that the estimated 42 trillion dollar world continues Government debt in the year 2009 only correspond to one-fifth of the 195 trillion dollars of global household wealth, "explained Giles Keating.
At the same time, they open up interesting opportunities for investments in companies that benefit from this development.
The Danish entrepreneur and venture capitalist Morten Lund experienced this in his own body, as a position of his portfolio with over 80 plants – the most famous of which was the Internet telephony and video software Skype – 2009 was worthless and brought him all over the fortune .
The development of exclusive offerings has led to new structured products, customized facilities and new investment funds, such as a 750 million US dollar Credit fund.
We can support customers in all areas – from pure asset building to the phase in which they need complex solutions for investment and investment issues. "
"Our biggest competition in recent years has been passive equipment," explains Küffer.
He was involved in two companies and had made part of his investments through an IPO of both companies to make money.
"It has already happened that we advised an internationally active listed company on mergers and capital markets and at the same time offered personal investment or financial advice to the family holding company," says Fleuriot.
In general, therefore, it is right to claim that, with the right advice and care, hedge fund investments are not necessarily more risky than traditional plants.
Alternative investments therefore remain an important component of any capital allocation.
Unlike in the 1990s, the minimum interest rate can no longer be achieved with an almost risk-free investment such as Swiss federal bonds.
The investment of coupons and redemption amounts of bonds at higher interest rates, however, compensates for the loss of market value in the long term.
However, in times of negative real interest rates it cannot be regarded as an adequate investment for the medium and long term, as the investor must accept a real loss of property.
By expanding the range of products and services in the areas of philanthropy, microfinance, sustainable investments and the so-called "impact investing", Swiss banks could therefore open up interesting new business areas.
Against the backdrop of the latent and hard-to-predict structural inflationary pressures, however, we are already increasingly relying on real assets.
Real plants are a cornerstone of our investment strategy.
The economic progress, the generous liquidity supply of central banks, the continued favorable or adequate assessment of more risky investments and the continuing existing investment pressure should further the financial market pendulum towards opportunities Be knocked out.
In the case of alternative installations, it is also necessary to put together the right mix of these heterogeneous plants.
In contrast to the euro or the dollar, even with risk-free investments in Swiss francs, a positive return is still achieved.
Do you want to offer the states a menu with only one dish or one meal à la carte?
Personally, I think that the invention of the à la carte meal in comparison to the menu with only one dish, which corresponded to the eating habits of the barracks, meant a great advance for civilisation.
"We just point out how meals that make you fat can be replaced by low-calorie, yet tasty dishes."
In addition, some dishes are complete meals, while others consist exclusively of vegetables.
That for courts, which were prepared only with meat, recommended protein/energy ratio (7 g per 100 kcal) is above the value of a targeted bovine half (5 g per 100 kcal), but is much lower than that for chicken, poultry and fish (15 g per 100 kcal).
Fruit juices (with or without sugar additive), nectar (diluted fruit juice, usually with added sugar) and dishes made exclusively of fruit, have long been part of the diet of the infant to be breastfed throughout Europe.
The Committee's recommendations allow for a slight increase in the natural carbohydrate content (up to a total value of 15 grams per 100 ml in fruits and nectar and up to 20 g per 100 g in a dish consisting only of fruit) which is intended to allow To adjust the taste.
Changes in dietary habits also occurred due to the explosively developing travel activity, the mobility, the advent of restaurants, etc., which offer foreign dishes, as well as the increasing popularity of foreign food.
Paella The court comes from the Spanish rice growing area on the Mediterranean coast, the region of Valencia.
A few days later, when the same dish was given to him again, he used his detector to detect ionising radiation at that time, something completely new and immensely impressive, and found that the food was radioactive.
He gave a little of a radioactive substance into the leftovers on his plate, and when he was given the same dish again, he used his radiation detector and found out that the food was radioactive.
We also have gluten-free alternatives and dishes for allergic people. "
As a result, there is a great need for ready meals, which has led to the development of new food products and packaging, such as TV dinners and pre-cooked dishes that are ready for consumption or only need to be heated in a microwave oven.
Examples of products in which these materials are already used are stock-stable dishes, snacks such as potato chips and peanuts, and also the ultra-light "brick" vacuum packaging for coffee.
Within a generation, our food has become more varied and diverse-we eat food and dishes from all over Europe and all over the world.
In each school the most successful dishes were awarded, and these recipes were published in the magazine "Ha Kuriren".
She learned how to prepare Italian dishes and especially desserts with fresh local ingredients.
If you like to travel in this way, you have to find these wonderful places only once, be sure to get a good reception there and taste authentic regional dishes.
The guests were able to enjoy traditional Finnish dishes based on reindeer, salmon and caviar, and Finnish beers were also served.
At this event, which was under the auspices of the President and the Secretary-General of the EESC and in cooperation with Hervé Coupeau (Group III-various interests), representatives of the young farmers of France and the overseas French Departments in the Committee, were presented typical products and culinary specialties from Martinique, Guadeloupe, Réunion, Guyana and Corsica and served traditional dishes and drinks.
If you add some flexibility and freedom so that a group can exchange dishes with each other, you may even achieve an even higher degree of satisfaction.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
You work in several places in your volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I also worked in the open all-the-school.
What are your experiences with it?
Quantity: It's a nice, wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to deal with different people, with teenagers, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years, so a late-appointed volunteer.
How come?
Amount: I've done high school.
And then a civil engineering degree, let's say, successfully canceled.
I realized for myself that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else, work with people.
And then I asked myself, what are you doing.
Do a social year, there is a glimpse, as one can see how it is on the spot, perhaps in the focal point, really.
and was it so?
Crowd: I've collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in the social sector during the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably at youth welfare office Herne a social worker training and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Is it not unusual to have several different places of use during the voluntary service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It always depends on where you make your FSJ.
It can be done from the retirement home to the youth work-in all possible facets of social work.
With me it was very varied.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, that was just the thing that irritated me.
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really works.
Unlike in civil engineering studies?
Quantity: Well, sure, this is not about calculating statics.
There are always other people in front of the head who have a different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, a teenager who has been brought out of the family-one must always respond individually to it.
Very interesting.
And you had no fear of contact?
Amount: I'm not the type.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
Much love, a lot of friendliness.
There are sometimes negative moments, but life is like that.
Merely the planning of the invasion of Iraq, which Rumsfeld advocated for the use of fewer troops than suggested, suggests an inadequate understanding of distributed systems.
Those who wanted to limit the use of jurors obviously feared a risk to state security in some cases.
Almost three billions of the budget fell for various compensations for victims of communism and crime, or for expenses for the Court disputes, even for the saving of the works.
The local authorities were unable to confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US counter-terrorism conducted indefinite evidence that Somali was one of the dead.
The first two victims were seriously injured in hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, again demanded the annulment of the criminal proceedings.
Werner Söllner is, as far as one can say according to previous knowledge, not only perpetrators, but also victims.
The troops are inundated with praise for their victims.
Mario Monti, future Italian head of government has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that "sacrifices" to the credit worthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government Regain.
If France were to take the decision to get out of nuclear power, a educated of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and the annual 6 billion euros in capital goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more together.
It is particularly positive for my group that the development initiated by the rejection of the budget by this House is now in the process of starting to resolve the problems.
But again and again, forces are becoming noticeable, which lead to a resolution, although EuroPilot, the organisation of European pilots, explains that Eurocontrol is the solution of European air traffic control.
The resolution of the Committee on Transport draws attention to the urgent case of Eurocontrol and calls for its dissolution to be avoided, or at least to maintain its specific, albeit limited, functioning capability.
How did the Commission assess the recent dissolution of the political parties in Turkey by the military junta?
Europe is changing under our eyes, but, and this should be emphasised, with the result of a dissolution and destruction not only of space, but also of family, culture and society: This is the Europe of the indifferent, not the Europe of peoples.
I believe that a further proliferation of nuclear weapons as a result of the dissolution of the former Soviet Union must be prevented.
The question that arises, however, is whether the separation, the dissolution will end the clashes, or whether these are to be continued in the face of the new geopolitical links that are now shaping up, which will probably not allow a peaceful life in the Balkans.
The dangers of the proliferation of technology and technical know-how for the production of weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, chemical, biological) have increased significantly after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
Their despair is the result of the dissolution of Yugoslavia and the failure of the leaders in charge to agree on how the peoples of the former Yugoslavia should live together.
It is also sprayed with fog when it is said: In the light of the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, other institutions could be dissolved.
They are basically asking the community: deepening the State or dissolving it into a free trade area?
Regrettably, however, the recent developments following the overthrow of the socialist camp and the dissolution of the USSR, the statements of the representatives of NATO and America, the blatant attacks or interventions against independent States, prove the The importance of the character and the objectives of a change in the armaments industry and the conversion of military sites.
But this is no wonder: No country on earth, not even the richest and best-developed Western country could have been able to withstand the sudden decline of its own trade by 85 percent, as happened in Cuba by the dissolution of the COMECON.
His dissolution of parliament, dismissal of the judges and provisional repeal of the Constitution, his incarceration of a large number of people as well as of course his ban on the free press-much of it is not only questionable when it comes to a democracy, but directly Illegal.
B3-002/94-0-278/93) by Mr Moran López and others to the Commission to dissolve the "Gibraltar Social Insurance Fund."

The members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "easily accessible installations in five to six places" in the upper Harz.
The question would be St. Andreasberg, Brown, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the boards should be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the star path will be extended by train.
"On the star path, the viewer learns a lot of interesting facts, for example about the physics of the individual stars," explained the association.

The earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun, which is exactly 75 meters away, measures 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planet path is a good four kilometers.

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were to be in a collision course to stage the most thrilling boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, went down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the world Boxing Organization's super featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, Champ?
I wish you good luck. "
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 pm on ESPN.
When the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko-manager Egis noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude."
"I am a former featherweight," recalled Garcia.
"I've ascended for Broner [at 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to come down to light weight.
And he needs to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let us give you that. "
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Climates asked whether it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko must fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree next summer with Garcia a date (37-0, 30 knockouts) of also interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after whose lightweight title fight in the Forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans have asked for it," Garcia said, and later expressed himself openly to fight the network that offered the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever you are ready... "
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter", and he may be taking part in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped by the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought the powerlifting-champion from Riverside "look very slow, I'm sorry Mikey... you wanted to be koed."
Garcia said the focus was to show punch strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum that was building up for their own struggle.
"This is the battle that needs to be done.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I am more than happy to work on it, "said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I've waited for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It's going to be a great fight. "

Fortuna's Hoffmann: "Triple chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2:2 for the season opening against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defensive formation in Aue brings points.
With the first season match Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result also, would not have been the two counter-goals at 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"These were two goals too much, and we have to be more careful in aue," says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the Ore Mountains, the triple chain should also be further optimized.
And the fortunes don't want to catch a goal after a free-kick.
"For the future, it will be so that no one is on the line next to Michael (Rensing)."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be better able to work with the triple chain even after the experience in the preparation, than with the four-chain.
"Nor do I know how we are going to act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funke, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we have players in the triple chain on the half positions in Gießelmann and Niko Abu, who can build well," said Hoffmann.
"It is a prerequisite, but that we harmonize even better and we do not make so many mistakes in the construction."
Of course, Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game.
"But if you can speak of a failed start after a draw, don't know.
The performance might well be okay, "said Hoffmann.
"But if we have four points on Sunday and we can concentrate on the trophy, we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season kick-off."
His coach didn't want to know anything about it.
"I only judge the start of the season after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Twinkle, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue, just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be terminated prematurely because of a storm.
"Now you can start the season quasi with a home game," said Twinkle and Hoffmann believes that the players from Aue might even be a little bit fresher, as they would not have a heavy and complete match like Fortuna against a promotion favorite in the bones.
"But you don't know so 100-percent where you currently stand," says Fortuna's inner defender.
The guests from the Rhineland go to the meeting in the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue on Sundays.
"The fact that we are sweeping them away just because we have the right to come under the first six is nonsense," says Twinkle, whose record in only one defeat against Aue from nine games is quite positive.
"There is no team in the second Bundesliga that you have to beat from the outset," says Fortuna head coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and overbearing."
And so sparkle does not want to experience his players on Sunday.

New results of the Swedish Asylalter assessment tests published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of those tested are older than 18 years. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (RÄTTSMEDICINALVERKET) has started conducting tests last year.
During the asylum procedure they should make the assessment of age more precise after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migrationsverket) was criticized for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years of age".
The tests are carried out only in cases in which the age of the person is called into question.
According to Johan Göransson of the forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been stable in recent months.
"We don't see a big difference in the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are fairly constant," he said to the local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that "suggest that the person under investigation is 18 years or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had frankly said that she would be 18 years old this year.

Judging the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we cannot say for sure, we should not pretend that we could, "he told the newspaper Metro.
Göransson from the Forensic Medicine agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of incorrectly assessing a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is when the person is just under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent. "

Work on the three Bridges of the 108 highway between Lauterbach and Schramberg Berg is progressing well.
On Wednesday a seven ton clung was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good at the time, it runs great", says Reinhold lightly, construction manager at the Department of Road and Traffic in the Government Presidium Freiburg.
In April, work began at the same time on all three bridges between Schramberg Berg and Lauterbach.
The end of the construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to ensure that the timetable is met.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg Berg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a vaulted arch bridge of concrete, clad with red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in the year 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come in the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are built of red sandstone.
Both were built in the year 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received on the north side on Wednesday morning a 1.30 metre wide and seven tons of so-called bridge cap.
This is an edge fastener, which is also used as an operating mode.
On Friday, a 2.20 metre wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge.
This is the pedestrian walk.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberg Berger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
The laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach requires a special sense of touch.
There is also a fiber optic cable to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed in advance of the work by handouts about the project.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fisheded first.
For the bridges between the Bauhofgebäude and the collecting pond in the direction of Schramberg Berg, traffic single lane is regulated by a traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbacher entrance, the road in the area of the bridge is completely locked at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Lindens".

The whole thing is financed by the country.

AfD in Gerolstein: Colourful protest with German potato salad
It is not so common for parties to pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), there is something else that is difficult to reconcile.
The parties represented in the District day Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Linke) belong to a broad alliance, which on this day shows a peaceful flag, because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle invites to the loud poster "great campaign Prelude".
And well-known names at the start-like Alice Weiden, who together with Alexander Gaula is the leading duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September, and the deputy federal chairman Beatrix von Storch.

The motto "The Eifel remains colourful".
Originally the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at one table" in the fountain, but now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondel-and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.
A colourful picture that is there.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of the Forum, a world and one of the authoritative organizers, is really happy: "Great how many people have come together here".
There is music and a lot of food, including a "urdeutscher potato salad, which the AfD could eat without any problems," says the woman who brought him along.
The police have ordered many civil servants to Gerolstein, they show presence especially at the station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes from the AfD Vulkan Eifel reported that he had tried to make such an event and got the award.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first asked in Daun, but got a rejection there, because because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes not enough parking spaces are available.
So now the roundabout, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a nice event here".
Looking at the event on the Rondellvorplatz, he says: "This is the good right of the people, the main thing is to remain peaceful".
This is also what it does: At around 8pm, there is a band for entertainment at the Rondellvorplatz, with various speakers in the Stadthalle, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall are about 200 listeners, who are waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weiden, and the deputy federal President Beatrix von Storch to keep their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.
A little more than an hour lasts the AfD event, the guests on the square have a longer breath, but also there is announced shortly after 9pm cleaning up.
The police can move away-no special incidents.

Coe praises "honest" Russian apology for doping scandal
The world's head of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday what he described as a blatant apology from Russia to a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be re-admitted to the sport.
Russia's athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the world Championships in athletics that his country's exile from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were snapped up gold and silver medals at competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress agreed to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF president Coe to reporters.
"The entire council and Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its re-introduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but the Congress supports the task Force's recommendations that this is not the moment to redeploy Russia," said Coe.
"We need to do everything in the next few months to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system, "he added

"Although the price-to-profit ratio is currently moving in the area of 2007, we are not expecting a significant correction at the moment.

Where the final resting place of the 83-year-old will ultimately be, is still unclear.
But he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he worked for in the last 50 years.
The native Henri de laborer de Monpezat, son of a French aristocratic sex, had met Margrethe 1965 in London.
He worked in the French Embassy on the Thames.
While his later wife had always flown with the sympathy of the people, in his almost 50-year-old reign, Prince Henrik had a hard standing with the Danes.
In an autobiography, Henrik commented on the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was wavering, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knit socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises that I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of socially-critical intellectuals in this country, I could not hope for complacency.
I was different.
I seemed to be content with this position and not to be ashamed.
That was two mistakes! "

Prime Minister because wants to speed up election
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
After the loss of the red-green government majority, Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a rapid reelection of the Landtag, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday it spoke out for the dissolution of parliament.
Previously, the surprising departure of a Green MEP from her Landtag faction in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the Landtag election, the Red-Green coalition in Hanover lost its scarce one-vote majority in Parliament to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
The former Green MEP Elke Twesten justified her step with the non-nomination for election 2018 in her constituency in Rotenburg.
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained on Friday in Hanover.
CDU Bundestag group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his group to take it up.
Thus, CDU and FDP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxon Landtag, SPD and green 68 seats.
So far, the ratio was reversed.
The new Landtag will be elected regularly on 14 January next year.
Thümler said that the red-green provincial government must now decide whether it can continue to govern without a majority in this situation.
Stephan, however, considers it indispensable for the Landtag to decide its self-resolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility for the Landtag to withdraw confidence from the prime minister and elect a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities have to be checked legally, "said Thümler.
"You will be able to discuss all questions in peace if they are legally properly examined."
Thümler called Twestens step "but something odd".
The politician herself emphasized: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good ".
She described herself as a follower of black-green.
The Greens called on the renegade deputies to return their Landtag mandate.
"We assume, of course, that you will return your Landtag mandate, which you received via the Green Country list, with immediate effect," said the national chairman Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The group chairwoman of the Greens Anja Piel said: "We regret the decision of Elke Twesten extraordinarily".
She has deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even with the background that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step."
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the resignation of the Lower Saxon Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU as treason.
"The behaviour of the former Green deputies in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of the electorate, but also a betrayal of red-green," wrote the federal chief of Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook.
He supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to have the Landtag quickly re-elect.
The exit Twestens costs red-green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician "in her injured vanity and in her frustration her personal interests before the well-being of the country," criticized SPD general secretary Hubertus Heil.
"It is scandalous that the CDU in Lower Saxony is doing this dirty intrigue game and trying to make political capital out of it."
Lower Saxony CDU Bundestag group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his deputies to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The Bundestag group chief of the SPD, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of distorting the result of the 2013 Landtag election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was the strongest force before the SPD, but the SPD and Greens had a very thin majority of one voice in the Landtag.

How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in interview with the editorial network Germany (RND) speech and answer.
Mr Schmidt, how can the consumer protect himself from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in their refrigerator and check the stamp imprint.
On the Consumer protection portal Www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the Länder provide the latest information on the affected egg batches.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, after everything we currently know, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Is Aldi now taking over the best possible crisis response-all the eggs out of the offer-because the central role of the Scout is not really perceived by the federal Agriculture Minister?
Food monitoring is the task of the Länder.

All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade, as well as manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are safe for transport and health.
If the maximum residue level of 0, 005mg/kg is exceeded for eggs, these are not transport-capable.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and eaten.
This time, the companies are not to blame.
Do production companies and consumers sit in the same boat?
According to the current level of knowledge, the production companies do not have direct liability.
Rather, they have to reckon with economic damage because of the alleged illegal practices of service companies.
As always, there are too few inspectors in an emergency.
Is it only lacking in personnel or in the conclusive competence?
It was just the official controls that revealed the process.
The truth, however, is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded to 100 percent.
It is precisely for this reason that a consequent clarification of such events and the transfer to the prosecution offices in cases where criminal offences may exist are of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete education from the responsible authorities.
is regular alarmism really necessary for food scandals?
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and transport-enabled foodstuffs.
If a non-approved insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The adulterated means that manufacturers, retailers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
In principle, it must be clear: the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the keeping of food-supplying animals is unacceptable and must be terminated immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all competent authorities to make sure that the facts are resolved quickly and consistently.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymars move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded spending by European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain of Uefa, because the leading organization that supervises the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial Fair Play rules, which were launched by Uefa in 2011, mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.
PSG can certainly make the money loose so that Neymar will sign and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team through the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on acquiring players, but must use legitimate revenue streams to counter taxes that will allow them to break even point in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in the year 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had incurred enormous debts in their quest for success effectively cheated and risked ruin when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In the year 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debts of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea-bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand-will become a tougher affair Should.
During the current three-year FFP investment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses in the amount of 30 million euros.
And although Platini 2015 has been disgraced by the presidency, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to discourage excessive spending.
"Certainly, FFP is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, compared to the Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount of the financial reporting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the transfer fee for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the annual accounts.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in the year 2014, the PSG, together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, has taken the most severe penalties.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which was later lowered to 20 million euros-and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014/15 to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 Player is limited.
Uefa is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by bloating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a katarisches company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship were to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when Uefa decided that the value of the sponsorship of PSA was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could be made via payments by the organising committee of the WM 2022 in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have disputed that Neymar will become the World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver for the UEFA regulators could easily be found out.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that Uefa will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG on Neymars transfer, said on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.
They spoke on condition of anonymity with the Associated Press, as they were not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euro with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published.
PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signature.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going, and she tried to prevent Neymars moving by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"It is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the president of La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily as in relation to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association.
"It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once a country has a club, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because it is possible to go different ways or to have different interests if a country has such a large player to represent a country. "
The Turkish community of Germany reacted cautiously: it reminded the victims of racist violence at the weekend with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
The urban tender for the 16 goals opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
Undoubtedly, a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either this is the case, or someone is about to make goals in the country.
Collserola is more complex ", the architect said, for whom the title" Gates of Collserola "contains a" lexical trap ": one must not imagine it" as access to a park, but as a limitation of areas on which action must be taken. "
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a goal would collide with that of the architect of the gate next to it.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success", "marginalized" people, "who always stand in front of closed doors" "Hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, Welcomed those present in a city that opens "their gates, infected by the spirit of solidarity".
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
Swiss is looking for a new Schoggilieferanten
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has made board chocolate for Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is at a possible end: The airline is rewriting the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed at the request of the news agency SDA a corresponding report of the newspaper "Northwest Switzerland" from Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the spokeswoman.
Around 17 million small Rotweiss packed Schoggitafeln to 14 grams each year distribute the flight attendants before landing to the passengers.
Swiss did not want to give any information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwest Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million francs-the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of approximately one billion Swiss francs.
But the advertising effect is more important: for a Schoggihersteller It is a prestigious order.
Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants are in the new tender.
Only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to seek a renewal of the Treaty on the spring of 2018.
For the SDA, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer could not be reached for an opinion.
Swiss has been distributing chocolate tablets on board their flights since 2006.
Before Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with hug.
Swiss introduced the opportunity to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the cooperation with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works together with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, the first class customers are pampered with delicacies from the confectionery Sprüngli, in the business class snacking passengers chocolate from Lindt and in the economy class chocolate by Chocolat Frey.
Swiss chocolate from Chocolat Frey, both in business and economy class, distributes the short haul.
However, energy policy cannot be judged solely on the environmental point of view, since soon no single power plant-whatever kind-would be erected and also, for example, Stone, clay and earth processing and all chemical industrial plants on the acceptance conditions Their waste must be examined by the population and, in order to quote Mrs Weber once again, it would probably have been very long, if not in vain, to wait for acceptance.
Besides clay and glass, metals, cardboard and plastics are now used as raw materials for their production.
This should be done in the best tone.
And the best sound is under the House of Commons.
I have not heard any conservative saying that we should store the waste in the best sound under the Thames.

This includes the so-called Monogerm seed, which is produced by breeding, and precision seed, which is obtained by artificially dividing the seeds (genetically einkeimiges or by technical means einkeimig seed), even if it is covered with a coating (usually on the Basis of sound).

According to Prinz/15/cohesive soil species always consist of a mixture of clay and Schlufffraktionen with very different parts of coarser grain fractions.
Under the same climatic conditions, the content of organic substances in clay is higher than in silt or clay.
In particular clay, but also clay, are installed as natural materials in layers with predominantly static compaction at the landfill base.
The sealing of landfills with such clay-sand mixtures is extremely economical and well controllable to perform.
The secondary material (clay) sealing layer of the Variant 2 consists exclusively of substances.
This base layer is more likely to be produced from condensed soils (usually clay) than from upcoming, Insitu compacted floors.
To calculate the thickness of the clay layer, the EPA offers some procedures.
In the newly created draft directive it is pointed out that for this system variant the previous legal requirements (60 cm of compressed clay with a k_Wert of 1 χ 109 m/s) are no longer sufficient.
In the narrow wall process, the respective geological conditions are obtained according to the compaction of the base, either by filling or pressing of sealing masses (clay-cement and bentonite-cement mixtures).
The gradient I of the wall area is calculated from the water level difference and the thickness of the sealing wall, while the gradient I is determined for the sealing horizon (clay, silt) from the water level difference and the depth of the Trogwand.
The sound acts as a semi-permeable membrane.

Nostalgia goes into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" in the niche
This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 years, for the 90 years grunge era (when the thought-leaders David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves--the is, for 2001, before her stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First day of camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By being stiffened to the core of the gags-middle-aged actors play hot kids growing up-they still made the impossibility of winning back the last part of the joke.
"Ten years later", with his adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more after the pouring principle, including a riff on the stalker movies of the 90 years like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand that cradle Rocks ").
At one point, a character rummages through an apple PowerBook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from the year 1991".

Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there's another crazy-vicious plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved, who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It's a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's lip-beard of "singles", whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like some sort of repetitive "seven Up!"

There are some nice jokes to watch (the police spend time watching chess on television, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers-including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny-makes for a decent game ' find the voice out '.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama--a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved--that it often plays like a single.
There are six long episodes, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.

Blow against drug mafia in the country
The police have succeeded in beating the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the Public Prosecutor's Office of Constance shared on Friday.
15 accused persons aged between 25 years and 77 years were arrested and already issued arrest warrants against them.
In addition, the officials ensured greater quantities of marijuana, cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
At the same time, two people were arrested in Italy.
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspect Italians.
The two are therefore probably delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
A total of over 300 police officers were in operation.
Members of the mafia are accused of organized drug-related crime, serious violence, attempted murder, and robbery and extortion.
Since the summer of 2016, the prosecutor's office has been investigating the organised drug trade in southern Germany.
Between the prosecution offices in Constance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the big bet was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning.

Also an incident on May 27th in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired early in the morning in a restaurant, is likely to go to the account of the gang.
Way laments large gaps in the foreigners register
"Data from citizens who should not show up": According to a report, the foreigners ' Register in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious wrong decisions in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Commissioner for the federal government's refugee management, Frank-Jürgen Wise, has drawn attention to large gaps in the central register of foreigners.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to "sometimes serious wrong decisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, warned in an analysis of the "Süddeutsche Zeitung".
According to the data, ten million people with foreign nationality are included in the register, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data are thus managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Since the data were not sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts has not been good so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 have been found, "by people who are no longer alive or by citizens who have become German citizens and who should not appear in the register anymore."
"Incorrect data entries can slow down return processes significantly," the report says.
The statistics on people who have to leave are also covered by EU citizens who do not have to leave.
Such false allocations, however, led "to a distorted debate on how to deal with leavers", it is therefore said in the analysis.
Meanwhile, the federal government has apparently begun to return refugee families with children under the age of 16 to Italy once they have arrived from there.
This is produced from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the new Osnabrücker Zeitung.
According to the paper, it is said that the BAMF carry out such procedures "concerning families with children-with the exception of infants and Kleinstkindern-after Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014 this was practically no longer possible, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
According to the Dublin agreement, refugees are the EU state that they reach first.
If a migrant continues to travel to another EU country, that state may send it back to the country of entry.
In the explanatory memorandum, the office now writes: "In the meantime, the absorption capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly".
Italy has made guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
The internal political spokesperson of the left Bundestag group, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: "Families with children are threatened with indecent reception conditions and a risk to the welfare of the child because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system".

The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the slowdown in inflation have dampened speculation about an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it maintained the interest rates on family incomes in the midst of an intensifying pressure.
The Bank's monetary Committee (MPC) policy makers voted 6-to-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members aiming for an increase this month, with weak economic growth supporting an increase in Has weakened.
In its quarterly annual inflation Report, the bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and 2018 to 1.6%, and warned that the pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to fall to just under 3% in the autumn Should rise.
But it signaled that in the next few years, interest rate hikes would become necessary to curb the inflation fueled by the Brexit and said that the cost of borrowing might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
The members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year ago after the Brexit.
It will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected that it will make 15 billion pounds more available under this system-with 115 billion Sterling.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the central prognosis of the MPC, the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, because the pressure on the real incomes of households continues to burden consumption."
On the interest rates, she repeated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be necessary to cool down inflation and a "slightly larger" scale than the markets expect.
The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in the year 2020.
However, the bank stressed that increases would be "gradual" and "limited".
The downward-adjusted growth forecasts of the bank for this and next year are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in the year 2018.
The pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision to make no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations for an increase in interest rates, and GDP in the second quarter has risen from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although the bank will recover slightly towards the end of the year.
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and small salary increases, as the tightening first gets worse before it gets better.
She added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" the incomes in the next few years, but she added that wages will "clearly" recover at the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also bolstered by the rising demand for British goods, which is attributable to the weak pound, which will compensate some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes one year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.25% last August after the shocking EU vote which caused the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that it will probably take four years for prices and the economy to reach its fullest.
Before the bank's last judgement on the interest rates, the call for an increase in interest rates had risen as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% in June to 2.6% last month, although the bank said this was expected and will attract it again in the coming months.
The bank said that the overrun in relation to its target of 2% was "wholly" attributable to the weak pound.

NHS (the National Health Service) is to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight in front of the High Court against the financing of the NHS drug.
NHS England announced that a pre-intercourse Präexpositionsprophylaxe (Prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-hazard patients by around 86 percent, is now estimated by the health service through a first three-year study for 10,000 people.
He agreed to finance the process after the Court of Appeal last year confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court that the NHS had the power to pay for the prep despite the assertion that the local authorities were funding it Should.
The move, announced on Thursday, was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as "important new intervention," while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a "crucial moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to sign up, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in April 2018 throughout England.
Präexpositionsprophylaxe (Prep) is a series of HIV preparations that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces HIV transmission in the case of infectious diseases.
To take prep before intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been treated successfully.
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive sourcing.
The study is intended to assess the full potential of prep by collecting clinical evidence as it is targeted, absorbed and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said, "This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in tackling one of humanity's greatest health challenges. "
Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
Prep, when targeted at needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September on, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, which will improve Many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, chairman of the Executive Board of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind.
Now that prep Test medicine has been procured, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people. "
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: "The start of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the Government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our HIV prevention approach and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of prep.
It is now important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV-infected and that it will help us to get a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society. '
Living the Big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.
It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace-and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"Before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day. "
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout-you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom-wanted to add Joanne storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement, "she says.
To this end, she commissioned the architecture and design Studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot-high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the handicap.
"The steel mill is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on one another without us having to stoop.
It was not just a matter of building a simple platform, but of laying the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below. "
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height, with a lot of additional drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored Goldmöbel, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.
By exercising a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.
What is special about this is that it is a garage door.
"A little bit of engineering went into it," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered mdf door.
"It's counterweight, so when you push the door up, it glides very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, they will sell the footprint-or how their property is valued," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the size of the soil."
Here you have managed to enlarge the floor area and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things they touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical outlets in the walls.
These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "
It shows that an apartment can transform itself by good design and increased square meters of something standard into something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave this.
An architectural history with highs, lows and happy ending: the Austrian Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels 1958 won prizes, was in Vienna to the museum, stood empty and degenerated into.

"
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" at the Channel RCN, said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition does not eventually become Queen".

Brothers fighting for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth over 500 million dollars.
The former director of the ' Carlton Football Club ' and developer Colin de Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother Paul. He has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be divided.
Paul wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers possess 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood.
There, the Westco family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold 1999 for 85 million US dollars.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre, the Development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs.
According to an agreement with her deceased father, Colin-of Paul described as "main operator and the dominant personality" in the de Lutis family-about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third.
A court Act states that this means that Colin owns property worth 316 million dollars and Paul worth 176 million dollars.
The Division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The splits suggested by Colin have left him with what I thought to be the best objects," he wrote 2015 in a first Affidavit.
Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also struggling to control the existing business-Colin, as Paul claims, has ruled him out.

Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid on leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars.

Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump-including news media reports-hoping to keep the boss on a Mäßigerem course.
Here's a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with senior executives on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he wanted to repair: bad information that was in the hands of the Presidents.
Kelly told employees that information about him should flow-whether on paper or in briefings-because the president would make better decisions if he received good information. "
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship to television goes back decades--and now that he's in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"When candidate Trump was annoyed because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from posts that were convincing," said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February against Politico.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."
Ok.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know to others-that Trump's tweets would have included even more fuel without their interventions.
We'll probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump hasn't sent.
If his employees had managed to keep him out of trouble a few times, then their efforts were worth it.
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from provoking controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may have their views of the world Promotes.
Politico-quite busy with this story-reported in May about the preference of the advisors to bring dubious information to the President for strategic reasons.
This was an example that was described by reporter Shane Goldman:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press clippings, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is stiffened to find out where they came from.
That's exactly what happened in late February, when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the internet agitator Charles C. Johnson's website, accusing the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "the source behind a To be heaps of leaks "in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he had made false accusations and revoked them in the past.
Trump read the article and began to question employees about Walsh. "
Goldman added that the then chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives".
How did that work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
In short, they fear that all the sacrifices made for price stability will have been in vain.

In the current boom, contagion has taken place within markets and across markets, as rising prices are fuelling enthusiasm-and thus further price increases-first within a city and then in other cities, even at the other end of the world.
Historically, home prices have developed enormously, and prices in the aforementioned cities are still rising rapidly, although this increase is going a little slower than it was one or more years ago.
On the basis of the growth trends, it is certain that prices in most of these cities will continue to rise considerably for another year or more, even if the rate of increase continues to decline.
Prices in glamour cities are likely to fall drastically in the next serious recession, or in the event of a shock to the local economy and rapidly rising interest rates.
In this case, contagion could lead to a downward spiral within and across the markets and reduce prices over the years.
Travelers negotiate a ditch and return to the ' Millionaires ' series
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands are back with some determined travellers on war, who have negotiated a ditch drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
The travelers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy road of Solihull called the "Millionaires series".
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after being thrown out in May, but without being deterred by a ditch dug up by the Council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a loophole in the defensive systems and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unobstructed to find a way.
Angry residents have harassed the Council of Solihull, who said it was "useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said, "They moved there on Monday night after they were sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at the passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame because it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, were moved further and are now back again.
More arrived last night, probably even more today. "
She added: "The Birmingham council knows how to do this by holding long teachings to protect your parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue paying my community tax if the Council can't even stop it. "
A resident who didn't want to be named said, "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last lap of these travelers just to be looted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park area. "
A spokeswoman for the Council of Solihull said: "We are aware of an unauthorised camp in the country beyond Streetsbrook Road and we cooperate with the police of Solihull. We take the necessary legal steps to keep you moving as quickly as possible.
In order to support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we submit our case. "

From Birkenhof, Waldhotel Luise
From the former hotel Birkenhof the Waldhotel Luise.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and will be reopened on the 1st of March next year.
That's good news for the city.
With the closure of the hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente mbh on April 13, 2014, at the time, around 30 000 nights were lost per year and also income from the tourist tax.
In the autumn of 2014, in view of the dramatic rise in numbers of refugees who came to the county, the hotel building was offered to the district office as a collective accommodation, which caused controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by establishing a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not uncontroversial at the time in the municipal council.
But above all, Freudenstadts Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious prospects at the house.
He should be right.
The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer, headquartered in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to return it to a house of the three-Star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise Make.
The group has four houses with the city of Freudenstadt.
Two of them in bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former hotel Birkenhof, rubble containers have been in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear how extensive renovation work is being carried out.
The floors were torn out, ceilings partially dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still much to be done by March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is remodeled and new windows are installed.
Everything should later become "beautiful to the Citizen", as Thomas Scherer expresses.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it."
Facilities include a swimming pool, a spa and a meeting room.
It would not be possible to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an upscale inner-city level, Scherer emphasizes.
The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set up wide, explains Scherer further.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or businessmen should feel at ease in the hotel.
Talks with whether Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause had already led him, said Scherer.
The ideas of the city are congruent with those of the hotel group.
"We are on the same line."
According to the amount of investment asked, Thomas Scherer does not want to define exactly.
Just under one million euros, he reckons.
The outdoor facilities are also brought to the fore, which is already clearly visible.
In the courtyard there is a large terrace which is accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
It is not an easy task, but it has to be done now and there is no longer a way around it.
The "Much more important task" is imminent on Sunday.
Not a single accident is the same and calculating the cost of parts and working hours can be a tedious and complicated task.
The basic models typically only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
The joke of the matter is that the company appears to the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
They must also accept that the SIM card in your phone does not run in your name, so you cannot have the full value of it as the normal customers of the mobile operator. "
"At these points, the traveller is also provided with a switch with trained personnel, who advises interested parties on the Internet purchase and also places the coupon on the card," said Martin Opatrný, spokesman for the project.
A passenger who does not depart with suburban buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupon ends can go to the self-service machines where the coupons are played on the card.
The elections are over, and now everything revolves around the coalition; In the debates on public television, the party leaders had little to look into their cards.
Russia affair: US special investigator sets grand jury
In the Russia affair of US president Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called grand jury according to a report.
The panel had begun work in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper took the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigation.
The CNN broadcaster reported that there were already first summonses of the Panel in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin of having interfered in the 2016 presidential campaign for a long time.
Mueller investigated whether there were collusion between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation will focus on several men who acted as advisors to the Republican in the election campaign.
Mueller has also been reportedly taking a closer look at Trump's private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator Trump personally put the spotlight on the accusation of whether the president might have obstructed the judiciary in the course of the affair.
The main task of grand juries is to examine the evidence in possible cases of crime and to decide whether to charge.
Grand juries are therefore also called indictment Chambers.
Most of the time, they are turned on when there are major and controversial cases.
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.
The panel may also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor's Office to summon persons for interrogation under oath.
According to the CNN channel, subpoenas have already been issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, it was said in the report.
You should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kusher and his then election campaign chief Paul Manafort were also present at the meeting.
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the establishment shows that Mueller is not intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wants to act quickly.
However, it does not necessarily mean that the grand jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the imposition of an indictment.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the Panel is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"The Russia story is a total invention," Trump said.
The theme gives the Democrats a chance to "feel good because they have nothing else to talk about."
His special adviser Ty Cobb stated in an opinion that he knew nothing of the establishment of a grand jury.
But they also usually work in secret, he stressed.
The White House advocates any measures that accelerated the work of the special investigator in a "fair" manner.
Former FBI Chief James Comey has said three times that it will not be determined against the president.
There is no reason to believe that something has changed in this, the declaration further stated.
Mueller had only been deployed after Trump Comey had fired.
Because of this Rauswurfs accusations against Trump had become noisy, he wanted to obstruct the judiciary.
Comey said in June before a Senate committee, Trump asked him for a cessation of investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.
After the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special investigator and its employees.
This triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller wanted to be fired.
Unlike an independent special investigator of Congress, such as in the Watergate affair around the later President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Ministry of Justice at the urging of the president.
However, several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented bills on Thursday, according to which the special investigator could no longer be dismissed as easily.
Antarctica: Gigantic iceberg drifts in Antarctica
In the West Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg has detached itself from the almost sevenfold size of Berlin from the Ice Shelf.
This was shared by the Bremerhaven-Institut Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine research on Wednesday.
The Colossus, which is over one trillion tons and 5800 square kilometers, is now drifting northwards and will probably need two or three years to melt.
With a length of 175 kilometers and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest giants of the Titans that researchers have registered in the past three decades.
It is not a danger for people.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear according to the information provided by researchers.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses of Eisschelfen in the region for around 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.
Many researchers believe that this can be related to global warming.
The now demolished Colossus has been a part of the Larsen-C ice Shelf.
Ice Shelf floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
So it keeps growing into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C Ice Shelf is located south of South America near the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this ice shelf, the balance of growth and abortion was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete ice shelf was displaced there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is some evidence that the Larsen-C ice Shelf is also in danger, because the front edge has never been as far back as it is at present.
In addition, the plate is under tension and can decay if a piece of the key is interrupted.
The melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not increase the sea level as it floats on the water and displaces as much water as it does after the melting itself.
However, the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and to drain much faster than before.
This could possibly increase the sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British Research Project on Antarctic Observation (Midas).
According to AWI information, the Larsen-C Ice Shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica, with almost 50 000 square kilometers.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the leading edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks down regularly.
"Although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University.
"This is the widest retreat since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.
It is controversial among scientists whether the Larsen-C ice Shelf will now grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding, "Our models say that it will be less stable".
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many Eisschelfe of the Antarctic Peninsula have decayed in recent decades.
This long tip of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to data from the Research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The increase in temperature contributed to the decline.
In the past 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula had warmed up by about three degrees and thus counted among the areas where the temperature was fastest to rise.
The Adaptation Fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member council, presumably at the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as stated in the "Piac és profit".

CDU wants to pay the staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU calls for the employers ' association to be withdrawn in order to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the District 41 has waved new jobs in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 apprentices have their first working day behind them.
The apprenticeship positions at the circle are apparently highly sought after.
About 620 applications were recorded for the places to be issued this year.
Nevertheless, the group lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
At present, there are still 50 unoccupied posts in the district of Mettmann.
The search includes doctors and engineers as well as General administration forces.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the circle of the Bundestag and to counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
According to the wishes of the parties, the Administration should "develop a concept for recruiting and personnel development".
The aim is not only to cover short-term demands on skilled workers, but to counteract future-oriented challenges for the candidate shortage, it says.
The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, show concrete measures for cross-starters and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know before.
Other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The speech is about a "competition of public employers".
In addition, there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.
It is high time to take action so that not even more vacancies remain vacant.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, group leader of the CDU, is still going beyond the joint motion with his party.
He recently took care of a fist-heavy surprise in the circle-time, when he publicly questioned the personnel cost capping and stunned the rest of the parties.
Peoples wants to see all the possibilities that make it possible to withdraw from the local employers ' association.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district Administration should strive for a public tariff with the trade unions, perhaps also in cooperation with the districts of the city," said Völker.
The CDU is thus trying to pay the employees and officials better than the public service tariff regulations actually provide.
Salaries are currently strictly prescribed, increases or more money is only available if you move to a higher level that is based on professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees would take care of the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection Act.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, the District administrator Thomas Hendele and county director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunters who choose more for the Republican side to use the tickets issued by these Parties for elections.

Italy tightens the tone of NGO-migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs using lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they should not continue to do so if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa.
Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organisation ' Youth Rescue ', because their team had effectively worked with traffickers in a way that illegal immigration Facilitated.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on the detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor, Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, the salvation of human life is our top priority. So we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment, "said the organisation in an opinion on the social media.
"We cannot judge any accusations that are currently being made after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of ' Youth Rescue ', the Iuventa, since October.
It is believed that its crew will take on board inflatable migrants, which are delivered directly to them by traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting was supposedly held only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the Act of the Prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of overcoming the authority of the Italian coastguard to monitor the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives.
Under the code of conduct, boats such as Iuventa must have, above all, an Italian police officer on board to oversee their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to stick to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and pro-Activa open arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, since they would not entail any "significant changes or hindrances" to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize-winning organization is MSF.
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue operations in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast Guard and co-operation with local Have borne fruit to the mayors.
"In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of Europe can be achieved.
A modest home market compared to the global sales.
Since their accession to the EU, the Central and Eastern European countries have gained importance for Switzerland, both as production sites and as sales and procurement markets.
When the price of oil reached the mark of 150 US dollars per barrel, sales in the US were already shifting in favor of more economical models.
At BMW, the growth rates for sales in the first six months of the year were even 100 percent.
We are also experiencing this experience when investing in the sale of road cars.
And he adds that the provision of information about a company's philanthropic activities is as important as the communication of sales or competitor information to board meetings.
The sales for TrueView-ads, i.e. advertising clips that are either played before the start of a video or displayed as display ads next to it, also rose by 45 percent last year.
The Skilled Industrial Engineer (Berchten) and the Robotikspezialist (Guernier family) are convinced that their product will be sold, and anticipate the future with airbags 80 000 to 100 000 each year.
The sales of computers, printers, servers, and additional storage capacity will be lagging behind software and services for the time being, but may catch up over the years and perhaps even drive up the profits in the highly competitive PC market.
After a decline of 10 percent compared to the previous year in the first quarter of 2013, the PC sales to companies in the second quarter were roughly at the same level in the quarter compared to a stabilization of sales figures.
Climbs and trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berlin Outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and Festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micheal's chapel above Deidesheim.
It was followed by viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far over the Palatine forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there were always longer climbs, for which long trials were rewarding.
On the second day we went to bad Dürkheim to the saline and the fair sausage market.
Again, the viewpoint was lined up with a viewpoint, connected by "Flowige" trials and moderate climbs.
In the last two days, many altitude meters were announced again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refreshment huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers inhaled in the open-air inhalatorium healing brine.
Neustadt was also controlled.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 metres of altitude, the group had met the Palatine forest at its best-sporty and cultural.
Console instead of lawn-Bundesliga gears up for e-sport
Are the sports stars in the future sitting in front of computer consoles instead of struggling through the stadium lawn by sweating in the wind and weather?
Fact is: E-sport has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business-big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high fees included.
The first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly involved in this area, have also recognized this.
The beginning of the 2015 was VfL Wolfsburg, followed by FC Schalke 04 and most recently VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sports division in mid-July and signed two pros for the FIFA 17 computer game.
"We hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB," says board member Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure "that there are many clubs on this train."
Next weekend, the FIFA World Cup in London will be organising the first "Interactive Club World Championship", in which the gamers of different clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.
"The real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, that the young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian.
With prominent e-athletes under contract, one could be more often present on these markets online than just once a year to send the Bundesliga team to Asia.
What exactly is it about?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League of Legends", "DotA 2", "Counter Strike" or the football simulation Fifa are fought at the competition level.
As in normal sports, leagues have long since become established, in which the pros compete against each other.
And in the Asia Games 2022, E-sport is already part of the official program.
But is it actually a real sport?
For many, the idea is sure to need getting used to.
Ingo Froböse has also dealt with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne, E-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports-for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal Changes.
It also needs cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding, and rapid responsiveness.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console, but also their body and pay attention to the diet.
"The Fit player is a good player."
Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more an issue".
Controls are difficult to carry out in online games, and the scene lacks the structures of classical sports.
The scientist emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sport.
The players are on the move internationally, this is like a big global family, there are no intercultural obstacles.
A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association for Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts the rapid growth of e-sport.
2016 were thus implemented in Germany 50 million euro, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and large tournaments.
In three years, sales will be at 130 million.
This is little against the almost 2.4 billion euro of the football Bundesliga.
However, the "E-sport" is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey, "writes the Deloitte consultants.
Many countries are already on the international level.
Major markets are Asia and the USA, where former basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG esports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the esports betting provider UNIKRN.
There is also a lot to do in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, E-sport was introduced as a subject, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, according to Dutt, the football Premiership football clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
"Germany lags behind in European comparison," says VfB board member Röttgermann.
Only to fall into nostalgia, and to clarify the old times, is no longer enough today.
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but at the same time to align the company with the modern market.
"We live in a digital world," says Dutt.
"You can't hold on to the fact that only in football everything stays the way it always was."
Unfortunately, the European system of State art financing is a victim of slow economic growth and growing fiscal deficits.
An immediate deployment of an appropriate civil and security presence during the months immediately following NATO's 1999 bombing campaign could have created appropriate safeguards against the counter-reaction that made victims become perpetrators.
As part of one of these projects, developing countries will be provided with medical information via the Internet, another project will provide communication equipment and experts for use in emergency situations and humanitarian emergencies, And a third aim is to give significantly more children worldwide vaccination protection.
However, access to resources is only part of the problem and I would like to underline once again how important it is to denounce the production, distribution and use of these indiscriminately acting weapons.
The forum, which successfully completed its fourth session in February 2000, deals in particular with forest issues from the point of view of a sustainable forestry sector, not only the underlying causes of deforestation, but also trade With forest products and the use of market-economy instruments for forest conservation.

ADE-egg alternatives for cooking and baking
Almost all federal states are now affected by the scandal of poison-contaminated eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and all the eggs from the sale are taken throughout Germany.
Only eggs that have been shown to contain no Fipronil should be taken to the shelves.
In this highly balanced meeting, however, the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto consistently agreed on the great physical commitment and a pleasing commitment of both teams.
The Council is currently examining the extent to which these mechanisms are incorporated in article 7.
We would therefore ask the rapporteur, the Commission and the Council to add the agricultural policy part to the Fisheries Policy section, for example by taking the title ' Agricultural aspects of enlargement ', ' Agricultural and fisheries policy aspects of enlargement ' Make.
I would particularly like to refer to the Council, which is unfortunately essentially absent, but has some expectations and concerns.
The mixed fodder industry has now tried again to influence the Council and to overturn the open declaration.
I would like to point out to the members that the Council's Working Party has unanimously decided to recommend to the Council that a joint committee be set up in the action programme, by combining the management and advisory procedures with the influence of the Can be increased in individual Member States.
In our view, the report contains a discrepancy over the question, which, however, my group does not agree on, namely whether the establishment of an internal auditor is only for the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament, or even for the To be prescribed by the smaller institutions.
Two examples: The Education Council, in conjunction with the agenda item on mobility of students and teachers, because we have found a strong inequality in mobility and the internal market, Consumption and Tourism Council in Connection with the agenda item on the development of e-commerce in order to make it accessible to all women and men, because, as we know, there is also an inequality of women and men.
So I have to admit that this amendment, as the Council and the Commission said, is not justified in this case, and I would like to take the opportunity once again to remind you that the procedures for import controls in the European Union are not Work that fraud is committed and these cases of fraud are not only bad for the taxpayer of the community, but also bad for the functioning of the internal market and even for fairness to third countries.
The Commission and the Council will do their part, and that is the most important thing that is currently on the agenda in Yugoslavia; That was always our interest.
As far as the Intergovernmental Conference is concerned, the work before Biarritz at ministerial level, I believe, has already been progressing as much as possible, and the informal Council therefore took place at the right time to confirm certain advances in order to provide guidance for The final phase in which we now find ourselves.
Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate the European Council for adopting the draft Charter as binding.
Fulfilling the demands of the large countries for more power in the Council and Parliament would disrupt the balance within the European Union and result in the small countries paying the whole price for enlargement.
We must support the efforts of Mr Prodi and Mr Patten to strengthen the Commission's capacity to act through parliamentary scrutiny and the necessary parliamentary control, which does not refer to the Council and Mr Solana.
Even though we share the criticism of the Council on many points, it remains to be noted that it would be a politically incurable confrontation and would undermine credibility in European institutions.
I do not want the impression that the Council does not answer the questions that it has addressed.
The Council is actively examining the Commission's proposal and the amendments referred to in order to reach an opinion on this issue as soon as possible.
At the time, we did not know that the Council and the Commission had pledged aid for the reconstruction of Serbia and Kosovo from these funds.
Mr President, the Council has really surpassed itself with the draft budget which it presented for the year 2001.
In this respect, and also in view of the Commission's concession that the Member States ' demands for payments for the Structural Funds for 2001 exceed the estimates of the PDB by 8 billion, I think it is time for the Council to take a very serious Think that we need to do something about the payments and not increase the "RAL".
In a timely way, this support and signaling effect will also be necessary to the Council.
Several proposals have already been submitted to the Council and Parliament, such as the package of proposals for recasting and updating hygiene rules.
I therefore ask the Council, which is not here, and the Commission, to convey the importance of increasing this amount, because, unfortunately, a new one is being laid for every mine cleared between 20 and 50.
The renunciation of the need for closer cooperation within the framework of the Treaty and the abolition of the right of veto and the possibility of submitting the matter to the European Council would constitute a breach of the fundamental principles of the European Cooperation within the EU.
The General Affairs Council approved the first five action plans for Somalia, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Morocco and Iraq in October last year.
The committee responsible has followed me, and the signals from the Council are also positive.
The Council will have to ask whether, with the award of candidate status to Turkey, it has no longer harmed this concern than it has used.
The Council adopted a common EU strategy for the Mediterranean in June 2000 at its Feira meeting and, after proposing and enforced the reform of the MEDA Regulation, the European Commission recently presented a document on the To intensify the Barcelona process.
The Commission and the Council express their willingness to do so.
What diplomatic initiatives does the Council intend to take in the interests of the rapprochement between Armenia and Azerbaijan, the resolution of its bilateral differences and the promotion of its cooperation?
Secondly, in its response to NATO, the Council referred to as Pontius Pilate, without commenting on the provocative violation of Greece's sovereign rights by Turkey, which was expressed this time on the occasion of the NATO manoeuvre.
But other countries really want the Compensation fund, and I have to say quite frankly: if we were to propose a compulsory introduction of the compensatory fund now, the result would be that we could forget the whole thing because there would never be a majority in the Council.
I would like to give one example: we know that the Council has had difficulties in banning exports of products that are considered unsafe to third countries, whereas this ban is very important for the European Parliament and we fully support it.
The Garot report aims to improve the Commission's proposal in some respects by trying to find a compromise solution with the Council, in particular for financial participation in the Fund.
The Council of the European Union, in cooperation with its institution and the European Commission, is also playing an active role in the updating and continuous strengthening of European rules for the prevention and control of this disease.
The Commission and the Council of the European Union have a heavy responsibility for the extent to which the crisis in connection with mad cow disease has been adopted.
Parliament can be proud that the proposal for the establishment of this academy was born here, and we are grateful to the Portuguese Presidency for having taken it up, and I thank the Commission and the Council for their support.
A declaration on the economic, social and cultural characteristics of sport and its social function in Europe is also being prepared for the European Council.
His voice would be stronger, and the voice of Ministers defending agriculture in the service of sustainable development would also be much stronger in the council if it could rely on decisions taken here in the codecision procedure.
As requested by Mr Brok in his report, the Council will have overview documents, which list the relations between the Union and the individual partner countries, in order to make better use of the Union's overall efforts to improve its efficiency and to better prepare its debates on foreign policy measures.
I would also like to say that, in the context of all the positions adopted by the Council, there is no budgetary commitment by the European Union to finance any military activity.
Furthermore, it is totally illogical that only the Council can amend the Financial Regulation and we are repeating our request for conciliation on this point.
In many respects, as Mr Watts has already explained, the European Parliament has a stricter stance than it seems to be in the Council.
Discussions have also been held with the sectors concerned and there have been many contacts with the French Presidency with a view to reaching a consensus-capable text, which is quickly adopted by the two legislative bodies, the Council and the European Parliament can be adopted.
I would like to say to Mr Jarzembowski that the Council is not seeking a compromise.
"It is a sign that there can be an incompetent and provocative official, but if 15 Member States agree to such responses, I think that you, Madam President, must take the initiative and encourage the Council to have a prerogative of the members of the European Parliament.
It is becoming more and more obvious that the debate on proportionality (votes in the Council and seats in parliament), i.e. the power relations between the Member States, opened up a Pandora's box that will be difficult to close again in Nice.
The report has been the subject of difficult discussions in the Council.
I have been told by my chairman of the Committee on Budgets that it is the first time that an agreement has been reached between the Council and Parliament in a Conciliation.
In the end, it was the voting weighting in the Council, which was most hotly debated and where it was most difficult to reach a decision.
As a representative of the groupings in the free European Alliance, I would like to warn the Commission, and above all the Council, in case the EU does not want to be more than an intergovernmental community.
But the Nice European Council, like many other summits in the history of the European Union, represents a victory of reality, a victory of pragmatism over Utopia.
If the Council wanted that, it would behave carelessly and imprudently.
Secondly, did the Council inform itself of the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights, who is well represented on the ground?
What improvements will the Council make to Directive 92/12/EEC, which is referred to here, so that the responsibilities of the supplier and the recipient are clearly defined and without the possibility of fraud?
According to article 23 of the EU Treaty, such a decision is adopted unanimously by the Council, as well as all other decisions with defence implications.
Mr President, as is true of the Groupement européen of Sociétés Auteurs et de Compositeurs, the draft that we are debating here has been attacked in immoderate manner during the course of its examination by the Council.
Secondly, this issue will be on the agenda next Friday at the Telecommunications Council.
The trialogue showed that the Council was not prepared to make concessions on this issue.
The precautionary principle was also discussed at the Nice Summit, which took note of a resolution adopted by the General Affairs Council.
The 2001 budget is largely based on a compromise between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, which we support.
The Nice European Council had a positive aspect: with the decision on a new weighting of votes and a new distribution of MEPs, with the involvement of the Eastern European candidate countries, he gave the strong signal of his willingness To record them as soon as possible.
Michelle Carter convicted of the texts that Conrad Roy is urging to commit suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boyfriend through texts and calls to suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended on probation.
Carter was convicted in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who took his life on July 13, 2014.
The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "My family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was allowed to remain free until his appointment.
She had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy were suffering from a mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood there with tears in his eyes, with his hands folded and down-facing when she was convicted.
"Their actions have killed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor to the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She took no responsibility, "she said.
"She has shown no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "terrible circumstance she utterly regretted."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said that he had not found out that her "age or maturity or even her mental illness had a significant impact on her actions".
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy saying that there is "no day where I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I'm going about everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pains that we will carry with us for eternity, "it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she was "persecuted" by the knowledge that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
"No longer having the only person I've been with since I was born is a pain I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in the year 2014 by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle.
The case attracted national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang on, jump from a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "all you have to do is turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press.
The case has shared the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was sentenced to 2007 for murder of her British roommate in Italy before being acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a commentary in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."

Joshua Kimmich: Learning about the new mini-lame of FC Bayern
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run for the Audi Cup as captain is no coincidence.
FC Bayern dares the confer Cup winner a great season too-extra motivation does not hurt.
Something was different in his seat in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich saw immediately, even if the extra garment was very, very small.
But since far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course no Philipp lame and also no Manuel Neuer was to be seen, he made his allotted bond hold to the arm.
"The coach has not announced it," the confer Cup winner told afterwards, after his first assignment as a Bayern captain.
Well, the start could have been better than the 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign from the coach could also interpret Kimmich.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal was chosen as the game leader in the existing C-elf from youth players, debuters and just from the holidays, but he.
The best way to distribute candy is to those who have a lot of confidence that you want to keep in good spirits.
So anyone who has been chosen to take the legacy of lame can only use a little extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: take responsibility".
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old sped over the field as a mini-lame.
Right back, now it's his position, the white bandage on the arm did her rest.
And at all, Kimmich worked in this starting formation like the one who can also take the rudder best in his hand.
He gave instructions, tried to steer the Uneingespielte troop.
He had the view for the whole, while many others were occupied with himself.
Vidal by overplaying his lack of fitness (barely worked); Renato Sanches with the devil come out on the achievements of the Asia-trip to establish (also worked only partially); And Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle not to be negatively noticed in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
That worked out quite well.
Süle ran alongside Kimmich, Rudy before the defense, both acted sovereign.
The famous Napoli storm often had a hard time, and Süle also tried to succeed in the game building a few times.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not as we hoped."
But he also showed a good performance in his debut.
Relocation of the game, tempo change: "I was taken for this style as well".
How unaccustomed this Bavarian world is for the new additions, one saw after the match.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich adopted a few crisp statements in the back of his new teammates.
There he heard from Süle an interesting sentence: "What is going on here, I have already noticed.
In Bavaria you just have to win every game. "
After all, he doesn't have to teach the new.
Alaba Motivated ÖFB-women
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's best-known footballer has reported on Twitter just before the game and wished the ÖFB ladies all the best.
The Bayern Legionary is a quasi club colleague of ÖFB-captain Schnaderbeck and has a fever with our ladies.
The tweet of the Austrian Footballer of the Year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational syringe.
Our ladies may also need the famous Bavarian good luck.

Company satisfied with Rhineland-Pfälzischem minister: Economy praises Wissings pace
It was often unforgiving, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Greens) was still minister of Economics of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on a T v request of a change in economic policy-and at the same time blame the old minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Association of Trier Companies (VTU), says: "Wissing attacks the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked".
The biggest U-turn sees Natus in infrastructure policy: the gap between the 1 and Kelberg motorways is now at the top of the country's priority list.
Later this year, the ministry hopes to have a planning approval procedure until 2021 is to be the right of the law.
A role in the country's plans also plays the West Bypass Trier, which is in the urgent need of the federal transport route plan.
The aim is to make the line operational in December 2020, says ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a signpost to support regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier, as suggested by Wissing, aspires to a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine export, which has been sagging for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praise the IHK.
The Trier chamber of Crafts sees the new Master bonus as an additional incentive for young apprentices, says managing director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euro is foreseen for the Master's exam and 2500 euros if graduates make themselves independent within ten years after the master's training.
But the homework list for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction, facts should be created quickly, at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, general manager of the Trier Chamber of Commerce.
Of 56 new engineers who want to Wissing mobility in the country, only 29 positions have been occupied so far.
The Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices.
CDU Bundestag group vice-president Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country is investing 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in obtaining national roads than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country as it will solve the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
The current broadband expansion in the country is also sobering.
In the year 2016, regional companies had evaluated the grid supply in an IHK survey only with a rating of 3.4.
They complained of overstocking Internet connections and crashes.
Ex-Minister of Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the Wind power company per wind.
The Greens group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe-where she cleared the field again after four months due to discrepancies.

Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles-car manufacturers face a backlash
One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW Chairman said that the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities-including Munich, where BMW is located-to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe in order to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the company as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to the car manufacturers to install facilities to neutralise the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of coddleing the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which is the use of so-called shut-off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested, but to return to normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several employees were accused of Volkswagen, while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent the emissions regulations in Europe, and a request to the United States was expanded.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could severely burden Volkswagen: The luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen's profits.
Instead of helping the camp Röszke immediately in the construction of structures that guarantee humanity, our Chancellor highly officially and publicly moved the Hungarian government's stance into the National Socialism circle.
When the negotiations began six months ago, Britain was the first to take over the presidency in the European Council.
That is exactly what the European Commission did recently when it put its first strategy for the post-Kyoto Arä, which will be discussed by the European Council in March.
The Commission has the task of monitoring the practical application of this legal framework within the framework of its role as defined by the Treaty.
I therefore believe it is entirely appropriate to entrust this task to an external and morally indisputable authority in this case.
This remains a task for the future.
Madam President, it has been raised what the task of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs could be.
Enlargement has put them and all of us before the same task that Monnet and Schuman and others were fifty years ago: A method of developing a structure and a vision for the future of Europe.
This message has the raft on Saturday on the ISAR
The city wants to protect the ISAR.
In order for the ISAR visitors to join in, a raft passes through Munich tomorrow, which has a special message.
If you go to the ISAR on Saturday, you will see a big raft between Flaucher and Reichenbach Falls Bridge.
And this is not a usual raft, with ISAR tourists.
But the department wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a great info transparent.
It shows a rubbish.
The prelude to a publicity campaign to appeal to the ISAR visitors.
The motto "True love Is..." is intended to sharpen the understanding of the ISAR as worthy Wild River.
Last summer the raft drove over the ISAR and again this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a respectful and environmentally conscious behaviour.
The European Monetary Cooperation Fund (EMCF), led by a board of directors consisting of members of the Committee of Governors of Central banks and a member of the Commission, has the main task of working Of the European Monetary System (EMS) created in March 1979 as a substitute for the "snake".
However, this monetary mechanism of the EMS differs from that of the "serpent" in that the EMS has been accepted by all Member States (with the United Kingdom and Greece not yet involved in the intervention mechanism), so that it Community system.
However, this monetary mechanism of the EMS differs from that of the "serpent" in that the EMS has been accepted by all Member States (with the United Kingdom and Greece not yet involved in the intervention mechanism), so that it Community system.
This was the mechanism that became famous under the name "Snake in the tunnel" (European currency snake).
The "serpent" represented the narrower range of fluctuations allowed for intra-Community currency exchange, while under the name "tunnel" the greater range of fluctuations, as granted for the exchange of community currencies in dollars, Understanding.
In the meantime, the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (1973 built to manage the snake in the bandwidth mechanism) continues to serve as a forerunner of the new institution.
It is forbidden to hunt, catch, disturb, kill, live or dead to acquire, damage, sell, transport or give to other persons completely protected animals (in Upper Austria These are most birds and snakes as well as all lizards and amphibians).
Banotti only something that he cares more about snakes than about horses.
He did a lot for our snakes, but he didn't take care of our horses. "
I have too much respect for the dogs, the snakes should hiss, our caravan continues with the calm certainty that every non-European invasion of the West was followed by a Poitiers, a Lepante, a Vienna.
Objectives C. In the year 1972, the "Snake in the tunnel" mechanism reduced the fluctuation margins between the community currencies (snake) compared to the bandwidths between these currencies and the dollar (tunnel).
The stability mechanism was joined and receded, and the serpent, originally conceived as a community-spanning agreement, was reduced to a zone of currency stability around the DM.
(snake) to ± 2.25% and to limit the fluctuation margins between these currencies and the dollar (tunnel) to ± 4.5%.
Gemeinschaftswälirungen to 2.25% (the "serpent") was further applied by the original member States of the Community and Denmark; The volatility of these currencies against the dollar (the "tunnel") was limited to 4.5%.
The return of the French franc to the queue, the relatively satisfactory functioning of this system and the introduction of a European unit of account were characteristic of this development.
In the year 1975, negotiations were held on the inclusion of the Swiss franc in the "serpent" in order to contribute to a greater exchange rate stability in Europe.
The logical consequence of this was that there were always difficulties in the foreign exchange markets: The French franc was out of the "serpent", pound and lira had to accept strong price losses on the international foreign exchange markets, and the Deutsche Mark was Upgraded to relieve the snake.
Readjustment of intervention rates within the "serpent"; The central rate of the DM is upgraded by 2% compared to the ere.
Within the "Serpent", two exchange rate adjustments were made, both of which concerned the Scandinavian currencies.
While fixing prices for 1978/79, this border settlement was reduced, but again increased as a result of currency changes in floating currencies and revaluations within the queue.
In the start-up time of the system, Member States that are not involved in the queue may opt for a few more bandwidths for a limited period.
The question remains whether it will be able to resist the up and down that caused the "serpent" to fall.
The former "Floateten," the latter were integrated into the serpent and could only fluctuate in a given frame.
In the EMS, the unit of account that is valid for the "snake" is replaced by the ECU, which corresponds to the value of the ere and thus is about 21% below the value of the "Snake Unit of account".
The United Kingdom and Ireland, followed by Italy, however, divorced from the "serpent".
The European rut, however, can also record undeniable successes: The British renegotiation of 1975. The general direct election of the European Parliament and on 12 March 1979 the introduction of the European Monetary System (EMS), which is in place of the "snake "has entered.
This construction was known as ' Snake in the tunnel ', with the fluctuations between the community currencies the serpent and the external fluctuation limits approved by the IMF formed the tunnel.
The three candidate countries, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark, joined the line in May 1972, but were unable to comply with the discipline and left the queue after a few months.
In the beginning of 1974, France and Italy also left the line, which thus consisted only of a small number of currencies under the leading position of the Deutsche mark.
This was the birth of the "serpent in the tunnel."
The serpent was thus half as wide (2.25%) as the tunnel (4.5%).
In addition, it was decided that interventions aimed at keeping European currencies within the queue should in principle be made in European currencies, while dollar interventions should only be allowed to escape the snake From the tunnel.
The EEC Commission then proposed a common float of the European currencies against the dollar-the retention of the serpent, however, which should leave the tunnel-including the possibility of the parities within the queue within Certain limits and under certain conditions.
In September 1974, French Finance Minister Fourcade proposed a plan for a "coordinated floating" of all the currencies of the community, which would achieve closer coordination between the five snake currencies and the four separate floating currencies. should be.
As a starting point, he recommended the existing serpent, but wanted to surround it with a kind of wider and more elastic "boa" in which the European currencies outside the queue would be included.
This outer shell could have larger bandwidths than the snake and could include a possible option for the currencies to be in and out.
In December 1975, the Belgian prime minister, Tindemans, in his report on the European Union, developed a series of proposals to consolidate the snake, which has a community character and its impact on the key areas of Economic and monetary policy.
According to Leo Tindemans, the strengthening of the serpent should also encourage the gradual return to more international monetary stability, with the first stage being to create greater stability zones in the world where exchange rates are stable would be kept.
This target zone for floating currencies should gradually move to the line in which the weight would move in favor of the snake.

Mordillos tubers noses and laughter against suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoon artists, the tuber noses of his characters are his hallmark.
Even with 85, the Argentine still draws and works on a film.
His message: laughter, "because there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In his first years as an artist, he was among other things a draftsman for greeting cards-which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day I lost my job," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he succeeded in the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, rounded Mordillo figures abound in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own data, he is still at the drawing table today, working almost ten hours daily.
Through calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, T-shirts, plush toys and watches, his droll characters continue to find much spread worldwide.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe-Mordillos most popular animal in his drawings-which has a myriapod as an opponent.
For the first time his characters speak in the 3d film, which is supposed to come to the cinema screen 2019.
"I don't know exactly what you're going to say, it's weird for me," says Mordillo.
The screenplay is not written by him.
This is why he relies on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced in a wordless way.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union €1 to fulfil its obligations, France gives just 10 cents and understands this as a comparable bet.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in the south of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining due to the drought-remembering conditions and the insect-borne diseases, which causes great headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert of the Agrarforschungsinstituts CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in the spring And in the fall much more.
This has an impact on the lifespan of lavender.
There is also a small cicada, a micro-bacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts holidaymakers, it is also very much in demand for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "
The solutions that are being considered include better water distribution and the slowing down of evaporation from the soil, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that More resistant to drought.

The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They have been told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, the 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: enemies, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column-no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of government or cartels, a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no respite from violence, and as the corpses are piling up throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year.
Among the latter is her editor and her Inspirationor from Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is present everywhere-a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "justice", hangs on the façade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the Thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists.
As with most thousands of murders that are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and even though the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra.
"It's very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know the why, we mistrust everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to go a few blocks long before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper-which is translated with "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a wife and two grown children.
Rumors tend to fly freely around in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions are struggling here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" when only one cartel has control over the coastal State with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First, in February, the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel groups in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have upset the sons, presumed gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newsstands.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He was 2003 as an experienced reporter for Noroeste when he joined together with five colleagues to set up RIODOCE and sold 50 US dollar holdings.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run journalism without bumping into the drug problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history wherever she led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take on the task that you, as a journalist, will have-either that or you play the stupid.
I don't want to be asked, "What have you done in the face of so many dead... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the Joker who could swear like a dock worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted in his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now ask: Was his love of routine to be spoiling?
His death has also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her work and stay alive.
"They do not like to deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their clandestine runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result, even in the best of times, is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa-just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where the employees of RIODOCE met for safety training, no mobile phones were allowed. Days before, it was announced that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of RIODOCE in a four-storey building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Half jokingly, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 percent of police officers who the governor himself called untrustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountainous landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's edition, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the assassination of the brother of the former famous boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government spending, which focused on the governor's home town.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was necessary when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favourite eatery of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), who dominated all political levels for almost the whole century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of high-caliber cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this venue, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Only a few months earlier, the readers would have considered the Valdez column to be the best-informed source of kidnapping.
"We used to know what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slender body stature.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
The Valdez office has been rededicated to the storage space for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they would never have expected: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration about another journalist to the prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
On this day, the director is Bojorquez away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and letting them kill them because they told the truth.
She has since asked her to be re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organized crime, government officials involved, and an indifferent society.
In his last book, "Narco journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also by orders from politicians and security forces who were under a blanket with organized crime.
Last year, the media guard group "Articulo 19" allocated more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials.
"In Mexico you die because you want to keep your mouth shut," Ramirez said.
Obviously, the killings have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were located next to their disconnected head.
Some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of their director in the year 2004.
2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the headline "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and you're still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it appears to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing from Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue work, it is a daily dance with risky choices.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade frightens him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones started humming.
A series of shootouts with gang rivals and security forces near the resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed deaths.
The war escalated further, as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region.
From the curb you have published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens howled nearby--another shootout in the area.
Bojorquez glanced at the policemen who stopped guard to see if they were in readiness.
If they were scared at all, they didn't show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed his footsteps.
"How can you even think of closing it," said Bojorquez, "when the same day Javier was assassinated, the intern asked me to send her to the street for reporting."
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling had an opportunity to "pass" to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing the decisions until after the election.

"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, economic adviser to the economic audit firm Deloitte.
After the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the biggest street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
The defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators arrested after the election were tortured to death in prison in August and others were raped.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the unrest after the election and the reactions of the government, but so amnesty, the mandates and the power of these institutions would be unclear and the Results which would have been obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been published.
Oaths rejected all accusations, but he also said that the accusations of Galbraith-which was fired-have undoubtedly inflicted damage on the mission, because there was already a great deal of skepticism about international interference in the election.
Having separated from Georgia during the conflict of 1992-1993, with several thousands of people dying, Abkhazia wants to prove by this election that it is ready to join the international community.

I felt like I had a right to get some advice.
It happened to his advice that my father put most of his fortune into the speculation which ruined him.
"About twenty years ago, a poor young preacher fell in love – his name does nothing to the point at this moment – into the daughter of a wealthy man; She, too, fell in love with him and married him against the will and advice of her relatives and friends; After their marriage, they said they were completely rid of her.

Then they come to the advocate for advice, and behind them a servant carries the files which are otherwise so secret.
At this window, you could have encountered some of the gentlemen you would least expect to see, as they looked downright bleak in the alley, while the lawyer at his table studied the files to give you a good advice.

But the sister, unfortunately, had different opinions; She had, however, not quite unjustifiably accustomed to appear when discussing the affairs of Gregor as a particularly expert to the parents, and so now the mother's council for the sister was reason enough to be on the distance not only of the box and the desk, to which she had first thought alone, but to insist on the removal of all furniture, with the exception of the indispensable canapés.

"If you ask me for advice," she said, after she had finished her prayer and made her face free again, "I advise you not to do it.

Dinosaurs used camouflage to dodge his enemies
At first glance it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening one.
Now researchers have discovered that the first findings of the incredible rhino of a Canadian miners have been so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa the Dinosaur".
It was so well received that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown--and they said she had something of a "troubled past."
The report in the journal "Current Biology" described it as "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period before between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly well-preserved state has amazed researchers who describe it as "truly remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivores is the best-preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
He met something that seemed to be out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paläontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild beast within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) of heavy lump.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it was asleep," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.
"It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens-the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that even though it is covered with armor and resembling a changing tank, this herbivores has probably been threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as anti-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to blend better into its surroundings and dodge its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines for the first time in May and can now be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild beast and named it Borealopelta Markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours uncovering it carefully.
The astonishing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered the counter shading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its base.
Although the countershading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It indicates that the dinosaur was chased by enough pressure from carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favored the veiling of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use the counter shading--think of deer, zebra, or armadillos--are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this Nodosaurier was a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predatory behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal for clues about his life, including his preserved bowel content, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much farther inland than they are today.
"This Nodosaurier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal," said Brown.
"The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the Early Cretaceous period.
You don't need much imagination to use it to reconstruct it. If you just squint a little with your eyes, you might almost think he's asleep. "
The Cretaceous period was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, traversed the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was chased by some of his fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six ton heavy monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank in the sea after death and was mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from snout to hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch long spikes protruding from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were washed by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin still cover bumpy armor plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as ' rare as a win in the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Petrified remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy armor plates that carry the skull of the animal.

In the thunderstorm: Mass pile on A8: many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass pile.
There are numerous injured, kilometre-long traffic jams and gaffers.
On the motorway Stuttgart-München (A8) about 20 people were injured in a mass pile on the late Thursday afternoon.
According to the first information of the police, at 17.00 clock between the junctions Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm almost 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, Ineinandergekracht.
No information was given on the exact number of injured.

Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "comfort check-in"
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced: there is nothing suspected about sitting on the train and sleeping.
Or one is deepened in his work and has just a brilliant thought.
And then: Pufff.
The conductor Comes and awakens an ungentle or rips the passenger in the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the Schaffner-free ticket control.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your place and devaluate the ticket.
A test operation is currently underway on two routes.
"If the offer arrives, we will be wide.
It is expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year, "said a train spokesman.
"Comfort Check-in" is what the railway calls the ticket devaluation without a conductor.
To be able to use them, however, some prerequisites must be met: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to have booked an online ticket-which is what most passengers already do.
You also have to buy it from the app of the Bahn, the DB Navigator, which is anyway the most convenient way of ticket booking.
And finally you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: You climb into the train, call up your ticket under "my tickets".
The test customers will then see a button for electronic devaluation.
The train attendants will receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger x is on the move and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the train attendant arrives at Place y at the ticket control, he knows that there is a passenger with an already devalued online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, continue working, keep quiet.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train-which in turn will use the passengers.
"If you want to travel without a ticket control through our conductors speak, simply check in the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to make their travel time on the train more personal, "says Michael Peterson, marketing board member of DB long-distance traffic.
Second Plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs".
Those who often ride trains know that in addition to delays and missed trains, the ticket controls are one of the biggest nuisances.
After all, it is often the case that one of the fellow travellers does not have all the documents needed to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to show is missing.
The result is endless discussions between the train attendant and the passenger, which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large area and delays in the control of one's own ticket and the conductor takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And that also only on the connections ice 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and Ice 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.
Just one day after she arrived in New York City, the one born in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of a AIRBNB apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled upon a post from someone from high school.
"The police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the road," it said.
Confused, since no one else on your feed had posted the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah has been constantly retweeted on your timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was in the process of tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body that was stretched out on the road and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," thought Ferrell with himself.
But death was nothing new for you and your community.
She left her cell phone to return later in the evening to tweets about people on Canfield Drive.
There were photos of the police band and people shouting, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who wore a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another cop reassured his rifle and shouted, "I'll give you... Animals all kill. "
"That's not common," Ferrell recalled in her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder that we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical."
At that moment I felt shivers.
I was angry and cried. "
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11pm, she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", in the cinemas from 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience, which is from the point of view of the people who live in the community and who have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell and her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a matching crown, drove to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation they had countless times before this morning» about the black experience and the black State «.
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" She remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right.
I couldn't take her away, "said Ferrell later.
"What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
She must know it and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the various layers of black experience and the black Constitution know and what we need to do to become free to liberate ourselves.
Even though I am fortunate enough to give her an experience where she personally has no blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women's child.
I feel like I'm going to do her a bad service to keep her away. "
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police department, which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter have joined a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly began a new kind of activism for Ferrell to take shape.
"My activism has changed completely after August 9th," she said, noticing that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in Black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It all came. "
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
One question Ferrell came to mind: "Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can take advantage of?"
This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by whites, in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently stated in an interview, "We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not have their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already collaborated with co-director Damon Davis, an artist in the field known for his activism around death row occupants.
His engagement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals, followed the team of "Whose streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. We're talking, "said Davis.
"That was the main thing for me as these people are portrayed, for so I will be portrayed."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience-to show that the movement is "not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan--she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose streets?" show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrell, laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understand that there has to be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader black-lives-matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in the year 2012, marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement as a whole," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything. "
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really held upright by black women and many black women".
However, it insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action" where Ferrell was chosen because of her identity as the heart of the movie.
"She was the person who roused this energy," she said.
"It is no coincidence, although it was at the front line, because in a life at these crossroads as a black, gay woman is so much at stake.
You can feel your energy through the screen. "
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of the blockade of a highway during a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A mess".
However, she clings to a song and she feels committed to this memory ever since she went to the streets three years ago in Ferguson.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose-except our chains. "
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
"Not at the front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow hats on the same benches, in the room distribute!"
"Very little space has remained in the possession of the city and we want extra place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago to re-pave the small street and set up seats, which are intended, among other things, for a café to which the company wants to rent space.
Thanks to a camera and a shape and Gesichterkennungssystem, this ' Rezeptionistin' can recognize how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the key words of their conversation.
From "Dream" to "delusions": TV readers discuss about bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, even though it is not built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping mall at the southern end of the pedestrian zone splits since the first presentation 2009 the population in proponents and opponents.
Cold leaves the subject hardly one.
Also on our Facebook page "popular friend Bitburg" The topic is discussed.
While the one to the bit gallery say: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "that would be really great" (Nicole Schauer), comes from the other side: "Need no Man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Delusion of size!" (Lars Scholz).
While the proponents rely on a gallery to attract more customers into the city, and the rest of the shops benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.
Add to this: The gallery is planned exactly on the plot where the farmer's Market hall is located, in which 13 direct marketing operators offer their products.
With the start of the construction work will be concluded.
The gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building-and to the Beda square with possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying in the farmer's market almost every week for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women always very happy.
We also discovered the butcher's shop for us.
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities, there is also.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of the rent.
The new project is unlikely to be very low. "
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstore or supermarkets: I find this superfluous.
There's enough of that in our town.
You can see how many shops here are empty-some for months and years.
Since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is maintained.
After all, the merchandise offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is, moreover, inexpensive.
As you can see, retail stores in a shopping center are rented only by larger companies, because the rents there are often not acceptable for a retailer.
Too bad, there are almost no special shops and what is left of it will probably disappear. "
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping mall with a market hall does not match for me.
and the gallery doesn't fit into Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the farmer's Market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution-even in the long run if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the Specter bit gallery already manage to expel all the shops from Bitburg? "
George Marquet: "That just won't work.
And no one needs a shopping center that is empty.
I think it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market instead of this gallery.
But there is no room for a farmer's Market hall thanks to the insanely many-as I find-pointless construction projects in Bitburg.
If the farmer's Market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again. "
An appropriate similarity: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannes DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible-white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptibly identical-hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and haircuts, which were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence, after she made public the secret diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called a becoming Resemblance (a fitting similarity).
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combines her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and groundbreaking dissident whose conviction of Barack Obama He had only three days left in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg has, through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from Manning, from which 30 portraits were created, how someone with these genomic data might look, a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual, commentary not only on the formability of DNA data-the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations-but also created for identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since puberty, 2013 was convicted of 20 charges, including six violations of the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison, her image was oppressed so much that there was only one photo--a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which manning visibly uncomfortable sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blonde wig--with which she was associated.
In the year 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project ' Stranger Visions '.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts, such as cigarette butts and chewing gum, by extracting the DNA from the garbage to create a picture of how these people might look.
That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so they contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal pen pals who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "suppressed images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which misjudgments a future in which the President would transform Chelsea's verdict and be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would in fact only a few days after the book was published, would demand Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong, since Donald Trump leads a war against whistleblowers from the government camp and against transgender forces to find new, tweetfähige ways to fix the rigid divisions that he actually should continue to flare.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning demanded with her oversized signature (the "I" in her surname is with a heart) an end to the "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which is sex, race , sexuality and culture. "
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence-a centipede of CS and GS and AS, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's highly developed scientific lexicon) how astonishingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people will hopefully take away from this is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, also to be seen Is.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of those stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the aforementioned comic novel.
She shows Manning using a hands-free phone in hand from the United States disciplinary barracks like King Kong.
"If you make your speech cold, then you have won," it says.
"So never shut up."
"It came straight from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose bumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person-just as it was anticipated in the comic book-but if she should do it, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulacra, which is like hordes of protesting rallies.
This was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, manned stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind its liberation."
Professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford for killing wanted
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University who are being looked for as a suspect after a man stabbed in a luxurious Chicago apartment with fatal injuries had been.
On Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56), arrest warrants were issued for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as shown by the files of the District Court of Cook County.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stings.
A community warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the corpse was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene of the event, and detectives investigated the stings as murder, while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president of university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now on leave and was excluded from entering Northwestern University's campus.
"This is now a criminal matter that is being investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is a senior Treasury assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman at the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "We are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help the U.S. investigating authorities in every way possible."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to put up.
Chief communications officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to ask the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building who had just received a puzzling tip saying that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza management team published a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving back to those who sacrificed.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) had called for Tuesday to protest against the project, which in their opinion is the victim of the pedagogical training of future teachers.

"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future"-the Russian Deputy Premier Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it would not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect, "said Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could give cause for concern to Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.
However, one of the criteria set out in the list is that the Russian anti-doping authorities report the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport must accept publicly.
With regard to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation as our anti-doping system has made a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist. "
Mutkos words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the independent Russian Anti-doping Commission.
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov gave problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
Nobody wants to accept this report unconditionally, "added Smirnov.
RUSADA was banned in November 2015 in the course of the doping scandal by WADA from the implementation of doping controls in Russia.

Every minute of the working day, another five people come to the queue, who is about to receive unemployment support.
The fact that the well-sounding concept of a common market does not mean much proves daily the long truck queues at the internal borders of the EC.
In the United Kingdom, this distribution took place under undignified conditions, because the retirees had to queue like in the Thirties to get their free package of butter.
Logically, this causes inconvenience, since the snakes of non-French travellers-contrary to the notion of "grandeur," which probably inspired the officials who invented the system-are much longer than those of the nationals of the Member State to which the said airport belongs.

There are 2.792 unemployed workers at every vacant place in Sunderland, and more than half of the school leavers of 1981 had not yet found work when the graduates of 1982 were already in the queue of job seekers.
This last point may seem superfluous today, but so shortly after the "Bad Time" which lasted until the 50iger years, every politician had the empty shelves in the bakeries, the food cards and the long queues in front of the grocery stores only All too present.
In the United Kingdom, the practice is very different, i.e. there are both really personal conversations, as well as the so-called "cattle Market", where the teachers sit at tables in the school hall and the parents are queuing to have a few To be able to change short, more or less meaningless words.

The start-ups that will help your business not get to the next
Amy Errett wanted to measure the happiness of her employees in her e-commerce start-up, but the polls did not work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful or-even worse-fraudulent.
And even if she promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.
"There was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
She called people from the outside for help.
A new breed of human resources start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, address specific groups and demographic groups, employees anonymity and Complaints hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to circumvent the C-suite executives and contact the board of Directors directly.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies To measure employee engagement.
Errett said that she gained a better insight into what her employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and polls of specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results-so they drill Can why.
Companies come to see that must remain at the top of the workplace culture so that they do not become the next to be involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that is an environment of harassment Which those who have spoken were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation, and compliance industry could have 2020 more than $118.7 billion value, according to the financial engineering website let's talk payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies to prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw a rising interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the uber-case discredited.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time, and view the heat cards of their problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the general manager is involved, complaints go directly to the supervisory board.
"The court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convercent.
If a company is found that treats its employees poorly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycott, employee turnover and lawsuits, said Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has deployed Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and an easy way to have their Corporate headquarters.
Earlier, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail for the corporate office, submit a formal complaint, and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays general counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints from employees.
Now that the company is using Convercent, problems that were previously hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states-such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair practices-can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view in the experience of employment," said Vitrano, who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002 more seriously after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.
But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies recognized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service and burden the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.
Sparkle secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its total funding to $60 million.
These investments come hardly surprising, given the networked nature of business, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing research complex that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than they have done so far.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes.
The employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they give their time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices are heard, and that the work they do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global Benefits and employee experience on LinkedIn that uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are engaged and committed.
If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and dedication of employees, it is no wonder that they will find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture important.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take any action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for their feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change does not come quickly enough, or not at all, this can breed disappointments and motivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at the business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies relying too much on data collection.
"Because if they don't follow employees will ask themselves," Have you really heard me?
Do you mind?
And if you don't care, why should I? "
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate action on the same day when a problem is reported on Glint, said Errett.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was through the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training To address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insights about its employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to better bonding of workers in an industry that is known for high sales.
"If you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose business.

The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It's at 11pm when a lot of UCLA football players are on the campus on one side of the team's new practice areas.
Some have stripped their jersey tops and show their backs full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes are a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise, before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.

The NCAA eliminated two-day exercises to ease the load of players, and it has actually extended their days – at least until the finals on Friday.

Mora said that he supports the NCAA rule change even if they add another point to the busy itineraries of the players.
"We put this enormous burden on you for three or four days, and it's very challenging," said Mora.
"And they just pushed it through, they plackened, they're great people.

Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora conceded that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," said Mora.
"This is a real problem, and it is not far-fetched to think that people are renting a room there and then setting out there to record an exercise.
If you have the videotape of an exercise, it's a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking 8.
We will do the best with what we have.

We have a plan. "

Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England
In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-ER and 1980-years.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the close by river Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a Mophaarigen Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
"What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."
' A castle in England ' spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist-Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote 2014 ' Dead Men's teeth and Other Stories ', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library-a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only responded to the thumbprint on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 years that worked for the Jacobin," he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
and letters always smell of smoke, because at that time a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he were there himself.
Oh, I love archives! "
For someone who is so beaten up with old papers, that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome greeting") This seems all too good to To be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, watching the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the assembled hyenas ' heads on the walls and the bottles, the centuries in the trench Had spent.
He wandered through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapers, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "whiskey and started writing."
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees were just beginning to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" oh, throw it in the attic ".
Diaries, letters from the time of the English empire, maps showing who possessed what: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to the two families struggling.
Boys, let everything go his way! "
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to delve more widely into English history, including ' The Labourer ', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book titled ' Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex '," says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought a uprising was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected? "
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle-like ' The Priest ', which tells the story of the Jesuit father, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or ' The Smuggler ', depicting the 18th century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made years later when his coffin was excavated).
The darrells are Rhodes ' favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite crooks, always making debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women--I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking guys, with a talent to woo. "
After the end of his mission in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has spent a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.

Ministry wants to rehabilitate route for racetrack shuttle
Over the past few months the future of the race-path shuttle has been fought over and over again-now it is to go very quickly.
Before the end of the year, it is planned to build on the ailing route on which the tourist railway runs.
In order to secure the future of the race-path shuttle in the long run, construction work on the route will begin later this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to continue to order and renovate the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this link, which is particularly important for tourism," said Transport Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of repairing the line was estimated at about 2.5 million euros.
The country 75 per cent of this sum.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future, is currently being voted on definitively, Sühl explained.
The ministry and the South Thuringia Railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details.
"This is how the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the ministry and the railway Company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
With this the Rennsteig-shuttle should be ordered regularly on December 2017.
The Rennsteig shuttle is a popular rail connection between the stations of Ilmenau and Rennsteig, especially for tourists.

Appropriate measures should be taken to ensure the following rights for the victims of crime: the right to receive and obtain information; ensuring communication; Participation in the procedure and access to free legal aid; Adequate protection of the person and the privacy; Entitlement to criminal compensation and the possibility of settling disputes through arbitration.
The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
Just when you thought that it 2017 can not become even crazier, comes a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yes, actually.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, professor emeritus of Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take their ascent seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
"People are making fun of them, but companies are delivering a lot of them, and we will see them much more often," said Mr Sharkey, when he published his new report.
Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm-with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more troubling, as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there's the Roxxxy gold sex robot developed by true companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah" that gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible," raves the true companion website.
So she likes what they like, and she doesn't like what she doesn't like, etc.
She also has her moods during the day-just like real people!
She can be tired, fixated on conversation or she can be "in the mood"! "
There are many troubling aspects to this rise of sex robots – not least because they replace real human relationships – but the submissive feminine traits that allude to rape when you take a step on Frigid (is called here: Reluctant) Farrah, worries one the most.
On his website likened true companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" it says on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.
Their genesis and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men, of course, will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR their growing popularity, they remain on the fringes of consumer culture for the time being.
But what seeps out of the edge zones can be very educational in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap in the fact that these highly developed sex robots are emerging at a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, where there is a president in the White House who boasted of having sexually assaulted women.
The most dissuasive aspect of the TV series ' The Maid's Tale ' is not the graphic images, the intricate bodies and the eyes that have been pierced, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but right now this doesn't feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.
But, to the point when it comes to their "personalities", the robots do not represent real women.
You cannot separate from your companion or simply leave.
They have no mediation or a background story, nothing that indicates independence or anything that might disturb the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are pleasing slaves.
Or to express it in the speech of 2017: maid

Trumps great performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have also split small-format families.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers in the USA advising on how to deal with the horror of Trump-electing relatives.
We're all supposed to be looking to burst our filter bubbles.
Less has been noticed is the power of trumps to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet who lives in Chicago and has been busy with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship with whom she had fought for decades because of politics, is suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but it is a further connection to me that this also brings considerable risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disempowering effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and "Trump", we're referring to the creepy possibility that his antics will one day not repel us.
However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump's right-wing Republican "normalizes", which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as the epitome of rationality.
I find myself nowadays inconsiderate of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the Madman – the dog on the rooftop, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) – both of which, compared to Trump in fact, a occur as very mild crimes.
When Trump goes, the next Republican candidate must only be mentally healthy to qualify as an immense improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we brought our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York Park department carousels, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder-all clowns are knurrig and the animals twist to look full of fear over their own shoulders-extremely sinister and the Klimpernde music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage-the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count-but a large roundabout in north London.
The Central Park Carousel, however, is still a strangely magical experience, as two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40 years can walk on it and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily no one asked for it.
On the other hand, at a department store this week I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.
In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip-this to buy something about the counter.
This not only leads to a slowdown in what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the department store was apologetically grinning while I was tired of the experience of reaching her my five star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius with chest pain moved from prison to hospital
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of cuts on his wrists, according to the prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by the prosecutors for a first homicide verdict.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder who hid in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius, which they say is too lenient.
The National law enforcement authority said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the opposition could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.

Also surprising here was the price of a two litre Coca-Cola deposit bottle of under 200 forint, thus the beverage, including deposit, only cost 257 HUF.
Our calculations have shown that Cora's prices in the "NAPI" basket compared to the Christmas prices last year at 15, while Tesco and Auchan each increased by 18 percent.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price increase, the price of daily consumables in the hypermarkets has risen by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at the prices.

When Bauer Arnold finds a kinda rdiges egg
As the last of the Blumberger schools, the fourth graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released into the holidays and secondary schools.
Three of the Entlassschüler go to high school in the future, four to the Realschule.
School director Angelika Sion welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Biesental House in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of school dismissal, the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young eagle who grows up in the Hühnerhof, but is then released into freedom.
In addition, the lively crowd led a musical called "The Eagle in the Hühnerhof".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg, and had it hatched by his hens.
Instead of a chicken chick, a little eagle came out.
But the hope of making him a chicken was smashed, and the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and vanished.
After that, the three and four classes showed a chicken dance in the chorus of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young Gockeln, who wore cylinders to make the bet.
The eagle is in favour of integration, said school director Angelika Custome.
The cub is different from the other Cubs (chicks), but belongs to it.
But he'll never be like a chicken.
His destiny is to be free.
She wished every fourth graders that he felt accepted in his new school.
This was followed by a word of thanks to the colleagues, the former head of the school, Michael Müller, who repeatedly jumps in on teaching bottlenecks and the parents ' representatives.
The Chicks ' ages are now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
After two years of teaching, she dismisses her students very reluctantly, because it was a really great time.
Finally, she could rely on the fourth graders.
At the end of the day all the students heard a song of summer Time and holiday time.
The children were very happy.
Eight first graders are already registered for the new school year.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "Please translate the first paragraph".
Two Bulgarians detained for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal camping in Greece, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted from the television, shared.
On the morning of August 1, the police arrested a group of illegally camping people in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day, they were released while an investigation is underway.
The Foreign Ministry reported bTV that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping, and they impose considerable fines on anyone who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The controls will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said that the court can impose a fine.
Firstly, because some young people do not use the advantages of these cheap cards anyway, because they would not listen to classical music at any price.

Software update for diesel vehicles: What the affected people need to know now
How exactly is the software update taking place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars in the Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 emission categories.
Euro 4 diesel or worse are exempt from this.
Anja Smetanin from Ace Auto Club Europe gives estimates:
Is the new action obligatory?
No, the software updates negotiated are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously apply only to vehicles that have Schummelsoftware," says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofitting has been arranged by the Federal Motor Vehicle Office (KBA).
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months, but have not yet mentioned an exact date.
Daimler has notified the letter to each person concerned.
If an inspection is due anyway, it will be done within its scope.
How long will it take to change the overall changeover?

The awards will be passed at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US president Donald Trump will host a reception and participate in the award together with his wife Melania.
The award-winner Lear, with progressive TV series known, has already announced that he will refrain from participating in the gala.
"The New York Times" he said: "This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights-even to deprive them of the means-and that burdens me".

We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslachs City Builder, will retire in the coming year.
The job is already advertised-however, suitable candidates are scarce.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And the work still makes him great fun, as he conveys in the press conversation.
He reports on varied but also demanding tasks that await his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application has yet fulfilled the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or a civil engineer at the earliest possible time.
In accordance with the regular periods of notice, there is still enough time for an intuition.
Since Haslach acts as the lower law enforcement authority for the administrative community, the applicant must have appropriate degrees.
Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.
If it could no longer be completed, citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But the proximity of the citizen is important to the city and to itself, says Wacker, who reports a good working climate and a good mood between authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, a number of important projects have accumulated, with which Wacker is proud to look back.
"We make the city worth living", he is sure about the building and its employees.
But also in the future there are diversified projects on the agenda: The transformation of the former Hukla-area and the Niederhofenparkplatzes, for example, have been initiated.
The Kinzigbrücke bridge turn between Bollen Bach and Steinach is renewed, and the stadium renovation is still a topic.
The latter alone will make a booking with around 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," Wacker estimates.
"All in all, great tasks are waiting for my successor.
The work here is fun. "
There is great scope for a city builder.
With Haslachs own building yard and nursery can be reacted to many quite flexibly.
"You can make a lot of moves," says Wacker, and the design of the green areas is often praised by citizens and visitors.
As the old town is listed as an ensemble, it is important to "have an eye for what fit" when new buildings are approved, stresses the outgoing city builder.
Anyway, the city builder is very responsible.
He is a builder, "in the end everything runs over my table".
He can count on long-term employees for supervision and coordination: Markus Newmaier (Building construction) has been involved for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) for 15 years.
The fact that his successor remains long is also a wish for Wacker: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job".
Continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further design of the city.
Those who wish to inherit Roland Wacker, according to the city of Haslach, should be able to have a degree as a graduate engineer or bachelor with a degree in architecture and have good expertise in the areas of building regulations and construction planning law.
The City Building Authority is subject to civil engineering, construction planning, basic acquisition matters, administration of the municipal real estate, municipal depot with building yard and town gardening as well as lower construction law authorities including monument protection.

Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable state, which affects around 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurring or bloody incidents, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells, That promote a tolerant bowel.
The senior researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in the food do not penetrate into the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease.
In experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a particular bacterium in their bowels.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan-one of the building blocks of proteins-to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a connection between a bacterial species-Lactobacillus reuteri-which is a normal part of the intestinal micro-biome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus if the same system also applies to humans.
Postdoctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was separated, did not Had.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal micro biomes of the mice-the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of mice were DNA-sequenced and six bacterial species were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but were absent without them in mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked an intestinal micro biom and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
In order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri had to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid-without the bacteria-to immature immune cells that were isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3 lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice ' feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Preragan explained that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic has signed a "genius", believes Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup starts against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the halter role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira at will Marching.

New low blow for Martin Schulz-Hannover, we have a problem
How the Wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader, social Democratic prime ministers always looked at a certain concern for Berlin before elections.
Just no harassment from the party headquarters, just no headwind from the Covenant-that was the most important wish of the election fighters.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the employees of the Willy Brandt House have been observing the events in the SPD-governed provincial capitals with increasing horror.
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with headwinds.
It was a deep blow.
One at a time.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens.
"This shows once again: red-green simply cannot be reliably governed," said CDU general secretary Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising factional exit of a Green MEP plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the Landtag election, its red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
The green-Federal managing director Michael Kellner has asked the renegade Lower Saxon Green MEP Elke Twesten to return their mandate.
The crossing to the CDU means a clear distortion of the electorate's will.
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate, "said the federal managing director and campaign manager of the Greens to the editorial network Germany (RND).
"This must not be true," sighs an SPD election fighter, when on Friday morning the new bad news the party headquarters.
Stephan Weil, SPD minister-president of Lower Saxony, is there after the entry of the Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU without his own government majority.

The aspiration of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin was not concealed by comrades in the environment of Martin Schulz.
They allowed him to be granted because they promised to stabilize the party.
Now the exact opposite may occur.
This is because the party-internal quarrel of the Lower Saxon greens is basically not a fault.
And Schulz not at all.
For the time being, comrades strive to keep their ranks closed.
Their anger is directed at the Greens, and here especially on the renegade parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is unbearable and damaging to democracy, as Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the SPD Bundestag group, the Editorial network Germany (RND).
Mrs. Twesten was elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but via the country list of the lower Saxon greens, the Lower Saxon MEP continued.
The logical consequence would be that it should return its mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Bundestag group, laments an "undemocratic maneuver".
"The voters ' will four years ago was clear: the people have made Stephan Weil the Prime minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxon SPD as a top candidate in the Bundestag election, the Rnd.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU MEP is distorting the election result," Oppermann said further.
He called for the background to be clarified.
I want to know whether there has been more or there have been further commitments from the CDU of Lower Saxony.

With a back-up battery and a normal SIM card, reliable and inexpensive internet access for up to 20 devices is provided (as long as a mobile network is available).
Against the strong Russians we collected a red card after an emergency brake and the subsequent kick-off led to the conceding.

"The tax collectors are not surprised at each other if they are a little stumped in front of a 20 kilo suitcase full of cards and I explain to them that I would just come home from a barter exchange," says Antarez.
Antarez kept up with prepaid, SIM and refill cards over water, but when profane Kassazettelchen from the supermarket took over the charge of the call credit, after about 30000 phone cards, the end was funny.
Often, Antarez gets the cards in the same pile.
«Ten years ago my wife and I met in the USA on the cards of Starbucks, which I liked so much that I began to collect immediately and expanded the focus quickly on maps of all the men's shops and countries», says Antarez.
There is only one nation in the world from which he does not have a map:
The smaller the edition, the more remote or enclosed a country, the higher the value of a card.
Well, there is no hand-firm, some mass-stable market for cards.
«I send a collector's colleague 100 cards that are still missing, and receive from him 100, which I do not yet own.
As a rule, I don't buy tickets, so I don't spend much money on my hobby except for postage and for travelling to the exchange markets.
"He could not give me an answer at first, but the next morning there was a sack full of used cards on our breakfast table.
The whole crew of the staff had contributed old maps.
He also learns support from various companies and businesses, where he has spoken and who now put cards aside.
In total, the collection of Antarez includes around 60000 cards of all kinds as well as around 100000 duplicates.
In a moderated workshop on the total assets, all the cards were placed on the table and the replacement of the company was discussed.
At Christmas, you can get these cards with heart-grabbing motifs and children's heads with big eyes.

In the meantime Bachmann has made 50 games for Switzerland and has scored 27 goals.
If you lose the duel 70 meters in front of your own gate, you still have plenty of time to defend yourself successfully.
If the same error occurs 30 meters in front of the gate, it is fatal.
In the National League there would certainly be a little more than 15 goals in 96 games Dringelegen (laughs).
He's not bad, but he should shoot more goals.

I think our coach Walter Eich, the goalkeeper legend of the Bernese young boys, did not take us so seriously at first; But after I shot 2002 at the four country tournament in Schruns the only goal to win against Austria, this has changed.
Joseph Deiss (CVP/FR) was also trying to get in the gate, but after two games it seemed too dangerous.

In the third paragraph, the application is governed by the Commission.
However, the more important provision of article 109 j is contained in paragraph 4:
It refers to a pass in the solemn declaration of the Stuttgart European Council of June 1983 (Point 2.3.7. Last paragraph):
At the end of the explanations, add the following paragraph:
However, paragraph 2 has a third paragraph with the following wording:
What does this third paragraph say?
The last paragraph of the amendment suggests that the work should be carried out mainly through research contracts and, in part, from the Commission's biology group in Ispra at the Joint Research Centre.
I would therefore ask you, Mr President, to vote on the first paragraph separately from the rest of the text.
Rules of Procedure article 14, paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 6 These paragraphs shall be replaced by the following single paragraph:
The explanations are to be changed by adding the following paragraph:
The amendment to this paragraph requires hot water showers during working hours
In the explanatory memorandum on page 8, the final paragraph states:
So either a single amendment replaces everything-and that was the procedure so far-or it is individually voted on by each paragraph.
However, it will amend this paragraph in such a way as to make it clear that the tariffs must cover the direct operating costs of the airline on the route concerned and that state aid granted under Article 93 of the Treaty shall be exempt from the costs of the carrier Deducted who can.

I would therefore ask all those present to pay attention to the last paragraph of this motion for a resolution, in which we recommend a joint study of all the new aspects of the sugar sector, which will be carried out mainly by the Agricultural and Development Committee.

In the last paragraph of article 3, only the right of initiative granted to the Commission by the Treaties is taken up.
In this agreement there is a paragraph stating that the Council of Ministers should agree to fill the budget hole 1984 and 1985.
As regards respect for human rights in the Community, the Council recalls that, when ratifying the treaties establishing the European Communities, the Member States have approved the following paragraph of the preamble:
It attaches far too much importance to a subcommittee of the Senate, which actually has no power, and does not sufficiently deepen the subject in the other paragraph.
The French version lacked the term ' the European Parliament '; As a result, the paragraph, which has been discussed very extensively in the Committee on Development and Cooperation, loses its full meaning.
A paragraph in the resolution tabled by Mr Herman and his party friends, on the other hand, requires a remark on our part: We are astonished that the Commission's proposals are considered only in the short term.
We voted on the first paragraph of article 102 a), but, as far as I recall, we have effectively not voted on the second paragraph.
It is a fact that the House has adopted the first paragraph.
Then this paragraph was voted out by a majority of the Committee.
An amendment that I have tabled and adopted by the majority of the house is recorded in the Minutes as rejected, and finally the recital β of the original resolution was miraculously transformed into a first paragraph of the main part.
In paragraph III of the last paragraph concerning the Committee on Budgets, the German text again shows the wrong translation.
In this paragraph it is forgotten that the Baltic countries are currently part of the Soviet federation, that their authorities and their peoples know this precisely, as they also know that the rhythm of the reforms depends on that of democratisation in the USSR.
I refer here to article 14, second paragraph.
However, if we analyse this article, we find that, according to its first paragraph, Member States are striving to promote improvement, particularly in the working environment.
Because of a misunderstanding, 16 members of my group voted against this paragraph, two abstained.
It is clear to me, however, that this would not have had any effect on the final result, since the paragraph was rejected by a majority of 55 votes.
Can the Commission tell whether it has submitted a report on progress in ensuring social protection in accordance with paragraph β of recommendation 85/308/EEC (X) on the social protection of voluntary development workers?
You will no doubt know that the first paragraph of article 146 of the EEC Treaty is in today's version: ' The council is made up of representatives of the Member States.
Firstly, will the Commission accept this amendment, namely to abolish the second paragraph of article 6?
For, Mr President, in each paragraph, it mentions the issues of the Kurdish question, the Cyprus problem, torture, freedom of the press and trade union freedoms in Turkey, and this means that there are problems.
Secondly, it is true that the first paragraph of article J4 of the Maastricht Treaty reads: "The common Foreign and security policy covers all issues relating to the security of the European Union, including, in the longer term, the establishment of a Common defence policy, which could lead to a common defence in a given time. "
I therefore hope that the Commissioner will consult with his colleagues on Christmas and ask them to forestall my paragraph in the resolution in the new Year.
We had a good start this week in the European Parliament, but we discussed, among other things, the Barzanti report, in which the following paragraph summarises the opinion of a large number of Members of Parliament.

Funding for the Centre III
If you want to renovate your house in the years to come, you can get support from the country soon.
This was informed by Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of Steg city development on Wednesday in received.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a review of what has happened so far.
Since 1991, it has been in received redevelopment areas.
At that time, in the redevelopment area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding.
In the Redevelopment Area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still at 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "success project"-it is ultimately important to promote interior development and not only to open up new construction areas.
On 4 April, the government Bureau of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a redevelopment Area III.
The funding amount 833 333 euros, which would be 500 000 euros from the country, the rest of the community received.
How does a redevelopment area arise now?
Schindler continues to investigate where the "really old" houses are.
It also plays a role, however, whether there is any interest in the planned area to remediate.
If necessary, the territorial borders could also be postponed.
The pier represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the Bund-country programme "Social city", in which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and development of the infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out in relation to the object, i.e. per plot.
The redevelopment area would then eventually be laid down as a statute.
The grant period for the funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
Until September of this year, however, the stocktaking would be carried out, in the context of which the participants in the redevelopment area will receive a questionnaire to fill in.
In November or December, the decision on the statute should preferably be made so that the renovations can begin in the coming year.
Pietzschmann then declared that each municipality should carry out the above-mentioned preliminary investigations.
The aim is to assess the urban developmental shortcomings and to decide when to rehabilitate and to what extent.
A remedial note in the land register will then be entered for the respective plot.
Pietzschmann will come once again and make a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants.
That is why there will be questionnaires which will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow Questionnaire is the "Building and property sheet", which deals, among other things, with the structural condition and the renovation intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and apartment bow", information on the size, distribution and inhabitants of a living room can be made.
The blue "farm bow" is to be filled only if business premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted, Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also emphasized that the distribution of subsidies according to the "Windhundprinzip"-who comes first, grinds first.
You could not "reserve" funds for later.
Finally, photos of the "Centre II" project were shown in order to make a renovation "palatable" for the present.

The advertising costs of the White House cost taxpayers thousands
The White House decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing in the last month will cost taxpayers according to the information of the military left to Time magazine, up to 24,000 US Dollars.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3d, known as Marine One, when the president is aboard, was at the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American building programs.
President Donald Trump, vice president Mike Pence and White House leaders made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-based helicopter was exhibited alongside a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire engine, and a Mississippi forklift truck.
The White House Military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it's such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superior, the Deputy naval commander for Aviation.
The message indicated that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn for the event at 3pm at 7 a.m. on July 17, and remained until the lawn was vacated between 18:00 and 21:00 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was to be delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the limitation of the hours of service.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground on the plane during the time.
From the records made available to the time, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 has asked if the event could violate the determination.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander.
"Sounds as if you are locked," replied the deputy commander.
The "Made in America" event was called the official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But also official events have political overtones.
At the event, the President gave an impetus to the reform of the health care reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.
But to request their use only for a photo op is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential aircraft, in the light of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, provided taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of messages about the use of the presidential aircraft complained by his predecessor.
"The White House is thrilled by the show" Made in America "-which shows products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials," said White House's deputy press secretary, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights in the Washington and South Lawn areas to set the US president in the White House with precise centimeter sentences.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 performed 58 practice landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted on the training needs of the flight crew for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours on that day for non-presidential support missions.
The White House said that the taxpayer took over the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
According to the US Department of Defense hourly rates for the financial year 2017, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3d is 24,380 USD per hour of flight.
Unit Records record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate.
"It is highly misleading to determine the cost of taxpayers based on the estimates for the refund rates," Walters said.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funds."
According to a RAND study from the year 2015, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract completion.
At that time, the former White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present things that are made in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this. "
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat down in the driver's seat of a fire engine.
In the White House, Trump spoke to Sikorsky representatives and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."

GMB-concern about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A union would like to make sure of the long-term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow for biscuit maker McVitie.
GMB Scotland said the company was silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, which produces Hobnobs and rich tea biscuits among other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he had invested more than 5 million pounds in the last few years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be "the first to know" if their activities would change.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland McVitie called on "to express concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be pushed forward".
GMB-Senior organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the general site manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross affects our members deeply.
Generations of families have been working here and the workforce is concentrating heavily on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, an important pillar of decent employment in a region with high unemployment and social disadvantage .
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving Production presence at McVitie ".
A spokeswoman from Pladis said: "The store manager at Tollcross only yesterday received a letter from GMB Scotland, and the company will respond directly to it, as we appreciate the continued commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with our employees that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and unsure business climate, we are constantly reviewing our business-and this applies to all our business units and locations-to To remain competitive.
She added: "Over the last few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross site, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the heritage of Tollcross as a production facility. Should our operations change at the site, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know. "

And then my soul made the first serious effort to grasp what was put into it in relation to heaven and hell; For the first time I looked around me and saw in front of me, beside me, nothing but an immense abyss; For the first time my soul trembled in shock, she felt and did not feel anything more secure than the one point on which she stood – the present, everything else was an informal cloud, an unfathomable depth – it shuddered to stumble upon me at the thought of staggering – and Into the chaos Hinabzutauchen.

Without a doubt, St. John would have given the world that he could have followed her, calling her back, holding back if she so left him; But he did not want to give up the atom of his entitlement to heaven; He did not want to give a single hope for the Elysium of their love to the true eternal paradise.
Then she raised her old lament: "Oh, why did heaven want it?
He regretted him, but then he explained that in some respects the sick person must rejoice, for it is the will of the Lord, who would give him the opportunity to reconcile himself with heaven.

She straightened her reddened and dried eyes to the sky, to the sun, to the silver clouds which were zertheilt here and there by deep blue triangles and trapezes; Then she struck her down, looked around her, to the Earth, to the crowd, to the houses... Suddenly, while the yellow man tied her elbows together, she uttered a fearful cry, a cry of joy.
It is one of the wise worthy death, which has wavered throughout his life: a death that is not flesh and not fish, like the spirit of the real skeptic, a death that seeks out all the doubts and inconclusiveness that holds the middle between heaven and earth Holding one in suspense.

As for Quasimodo, who had not stopped for a moment to fight, he fell down on both knees as he saw this savage flight, and raised his hands to heaven; Then he stormed away with joy, and ascended with the swiftness of a bird to that cell, whose entrances he had so fearlessly defended.

A heavy clap of thunder came rolling and blustering down from the sky and lost in the distance in muffled rumblings.
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago Neymar?
The page of La Liga may regret your interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not let in its persecution of Neymar after it has made an offer of £189 million to trigger its release clause, but have you warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record robbery?
The sensational approach has fueled the transfer window in the summer, as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds last season.
After completion, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers salaries of more than 500,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona is furious about the way Neymar has forced its way outside, although a source near the Catalan board insists that the club has always given its best to take care of it since its arrival from Santos in the year 2013.
But did the PSG president warn the football world three years ago of this prospect?
When Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for every club that wanted to sign one of PSG's best players.

"We respect all clubs.
But if you try to have one of our players signed, it will have consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club at the beginning of this summer expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.

Positions at General Motors Overseas Corporation with responsibility for European sales, marketing, planning and trade relations.
History: The concept of tariff preferences is based on the recognition that it is particularly difficult for the countries whose industry is still under construction, i.e. developing countries, to gain a foothold in the markets of the industrialised countries and to increase their sales there.
Such a market structure attracts internationalisation, because national oligopolies with a stable internal market are looking elsewhere to increase their sales.
Price reductions when sales are exceeded: in France, automatic price reductions apply to products whose sales significantly exceed those indicated in the original price calculation application.
Uniform EC standards also create an important competitive advantage for the European car industry in front of truck manufacturers outside the community, since 57 states are now taking over EC standards in their national legislation, because they have Recognised that they are also useful and practicable for their countries; This promotes truck sales and at the same time creates thousands of new jobs within the community that we need so much, Mr Collins.
It seems important to me to note that in the European automotive industry, all farms have been behind a record year in sales by the beginning of 1980, and that the advance of Japanese competition has long been foreseeable, also on the part of the Automotive industry in Europe, which perhaps partly believed that things were going on so cheaply, without having to exert themselves accordingly.
It will exacerbate intra-European competition, because even the Member States of the community, which have hitherto tried to secure themselves in a restrictive way against Japanese competition, will soon find that the European suppliers are moving towards the Market in these countries in order to secure the sale of their vehicles in spite of the increased Japanese imports.

As you know, the community has fallen considerably behind in this area over the last ten years, as its paragraph, which at that time was already moderate, shows.

The community consumer organisations, like the Socialist Group, have been tirelessly pointing out for years that only a departure from sales and price guarantees and the turning to genuine structural policy will restore the process vehicle to the right track Can bring.

This initiative is all the more correct, as we already have estimates of the campaigns to promote the sale of olive oil and flax-which Mr Fantuzzi has also pointed out-whose sales in third countries, thanks to the support of ad hoc instruments Has risen.

(14) The impact on the Community industry concerned, in particular those companies which produce a large proportion of non-standard goods, was mainly due to a decline in production, in sales and Marktanteüverlusten As well as a significant decline in prices, combined with significant reductions in net proceeds or rising losses.
-Increased sales of raw materials from the ACP countries in the Eastern European countries;
The Commissioner, Mr CHEYSSCN, recalled that the alcohol market in the community is undergoing a clearly declining development, which naturally has a effect on the sale of rum as well as other spirits in this market.
Their production and sales increased by 2% from 1981 to 1984.
Compare community data on production and sales of industrial products;
-Compare community data on production and sales of industrial products; -Assess domestic markets; -Compare economic sectors; -Know the current situation and plan the future of these industries; -To be more informed and more competitive.
In recent years, sales to natural gas have been broken down as follows:
The paragraph was distributed as follows (estimate 1984):
In its turn, sales to households in the year 1984 were distributed according to the following zones: kwh/year
In the year 1984, the sales of the public network were distributed as follows (preliminary results):
These associations, which are subject to civil law, may, on the express condition that they do not distribute any profits (not even in the form of rebates) to their members, to the joint purchase or The common use of agricultural machinery and the collective supply of its members and the collective sale of their products.
Without neglecting the important aspect of raw material supply, a stronger focus on sales and market problems was therefore urgently needed.
The increased sales of motor vehicles 1994 led to a slight recovery in the production of the rubber industry, although the production still did not reach the level of 1992 in the market.
The fact that the large enterprises are weakened or even close is also contributing to the lively development of small businesses and their share of sales in France from 1980 to 1988 by 10%.
Sales of coal coke decreased in the community since 1990 from 45 million tonnes to 40 million tonnes. During this period, the percentage declines in the individual countries were between 3% (UK) and 17% (Luxembourg).
Sales of coal coke decreased by 1.8 million tonnes in the EU (4.4%) from 39.7 million tonnes in 1992 to 37.9 million tonnes in 1993.
The shortage of beef is likely to have favoured the sale of poultry meat, the prices of which are relatively low and attractive to the consumer.
A decision under article 86 obliges the United Brands company to abandon the following abusive practices in the sale of Chiquita brand bananas within the Common market: closure of the market as a result of the ban, green bananas Resell; Refusal to supply a Danish Reiferei introducing bananas; Differentiated sales policy in which the Irish, German, Danish, Dutch and Belgian customers are charged different prices; The use of inappropriate prices for customers in the latter four Member States.
The main measures introduced in 1972 for the sale of butter and skimmed milk powder surpluses have also been continued this year; In particular, butter cheapened was given to certain food industries and consumer groups.
However, the continuing bad economic situation in the second half of 1975 has resulted in significant losses in the sale of coal and coke to the thermal power plants and to the iron and steel industry.
The Joint Group of Experts, which was established after the visit of President Jenkins in Tokyo in October 1977, will further examine in depth the conditions for the access of Community products to the Japanese market in the sectors where the Increase in sales.
On the other hand, the paragraph should also be secured.
(i) Either the commission or the usual surcharges for profit and overheads (including the direct and indirect costs of the sales) for imported goods of the same genus, as a rule, in the case of a sale in the community or type;
The Community shall support the financing of work which will help to increase production, reduce the price of prices or facilitate the sale of the products concerned.
(i) Either the commission or the usual surcharges for profit and overheads (including the direct and indirect costs of the sales) for imported goods of the same genus, as a rule, in the case of a sale in the community or type;
Tunisia's sales of industrial products focus heavily on apparel and, to a lesser extent, on textile materials (1979 more than 18% of all exports); This is partly due to the spectacular increase in "outward processing", which followed the investments of companies from Community countries, in particular from the Federal Republic of Germany.
This could even lead to the fact that, as is already the case with the products of the north, the community is supplanting established exporters through subsidised sales on the world market.
In particular, Morocco managed to redistribute its sales of France and the Federal Republic to the Benelux countries and Scandinavia and especially the USSR and Saudi Arabia.
This solution should have the advantage of having a less open community commitment than revenue guarantees or guaranteed/Absatz on the Community markets themselves.
Since employment is at least as important as the effects on the balance of payments in most of these cases, it would be a better way to guarantee sales of reduced quantities, but to higher (possibly intra-community) prices than Earlier.
The prohibition of minimum prices does not apply to the sale of books, newspapers and magazines, or to goods and services subject to specific legislation in which at least or fixed prices are enshrined.
They represent the decisive framework conditions for the sales and Entwicklungsmögleichheiten for regional production and employment.
In the case of mineral raw materials such as copper, phosphate and iron ore, the ACP countries receive project assistance if production and sales are at risk and the export proceeds fall.
The overall concentration in the food production and processing sector is low, measured in terms of sales.
Of course, this programme is not a panacea for European agriculture: in individual cases, however, it can help to develop new sales and income opportunities.
As long as the crisis persists, it is often accused of protectionism on both sides; This accusation is raised by lobbies who encounter obstacles in the sale of their products or who fear that their market will be swamped by products that no longer flow into the usual sales areas.
The Dutch exports, which consist of a considerable part (1983 almost 30%) of basic materials and precursors whose sales are particularly responsive to economic developments, could be stimulated in particular by the current stock-building.
This would be a considerable increase in volume, taking into account that the forecasts for sales on foreign markets amounted to 440 billion m3 in the middle of 1983.
In fact, it is likely that the demand for steel products is unlikely to it's, which is likely to be reflected in a rather slow increase in overall exports, although sales of new companies will develop dynamically.
While sales of natural gas abroad tended to continue to lower compared to 1986, exports of finished goods developed relatively briskly despite the strong appreciation of the guilder in the years 1986 and 1987.
As the ministries continued to control the supply of raw materials and prices and to guarantee sales, most of the company's management seems to have been more interested in a good relationship with the apparatus than To demand a regained entrepreneurial freedom.
Parliament must also be represented on the board of Europol and be able to participate in the election of the Director of that institution.

The Touranium driver Touchierte the guard rails.
Damage to the car arose.
The driver of the oncoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overhauled a truck and continued his journey without worrying about the traffic accident.
According to the accident victim, it may well be that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the polluting vehicle to contact the Commission in Stolzenau under Tel. 05761/92060.
The lack of storage and transport capacities as well as organisational difficulties mean that the slurry has to be concentrated "disposed" on land-conveniently located agricultural areas.
These bookstores publish the publications of EUR-op in a shop window or a part of a shop window reserved for this purpose and must have the most important publications of EUR-op constantly in stock; In addition, you must be connected to an online ordering system to obtain unstocked securities.
The fall in domestic consumption due to economic crisis, declining income of the workforce due to unemployment and high inflation, and the decline in exports of Greek wines have led to significant Stocks, for example, in Crete, Santorini and other areas.
In addition to the 1981 harvest, there are still 115 000 tonnes of the 1980s harvest in stock that could not be deposed.
Only one of the speakers spoke of the possibility that his own garden could become a storage place for radioactive waste.
We should be ashamed that we have huge amounts of milk and butter in stock, while in the third World children are dying of hunger.
It can, of course, also reject them at this stage, but this would only be postponed, because the day will surely come when the Council is bound to reduce quotas and dissolve the camps.
However, the honourable Member's finding that 50 000 tonnes of last year's harvest are in stock is to be contradicted.
If we carry on with our land-deposition program, we will soon have 18 million tonnes in stock.
The Commission suggests that the camps are too large, which is not true, because less than nine million tonnes of stock, not even 6% of the annual production, is not exaggerated, but let us leave that aside.
After intervention purchases, we have 200 000 tonnes of butter in stock, apart from the East German stocks, and by the end of this year these stocks will grow to about 270 000 tonnes.
The war will come to an end, and in the camp of the vanquished as in the camp of the victors one will take stock.

According to press reports, an old load ship is in use in the Saronic Gulf, which was refunctioned eight years ago to a floating laboratory and a warehouse for the oil-containing waste of the passing ships.
The offers must be addressed to the intervention centres which have good stock and resale facilities.
And now we are told that the camps are too expensive.
Most of my group supports the rapporteur's amendment that military facilities or camps should fall within the scope of the directive.
The entire camp is divided into different rooms.
In principle, it should be possible for Germany, France or England to deposit their radioactive waste in a warehouse in Sweden.
The concentration of the production capacity enables maximum economies of scale and leads to the task of interconnected production, storage and transhipment locations, resulting in agglomerations in the production and distribution areas.
Up to the point of individualization, the number of bearings is kept as low as possible, reducing storage risk, storage costs and throughput times.
Concrete applications include: business people who want to retrieve their faxes and email transmissions from the outskirts and without special equipment, sellers who want to check without a terminal, whether a given product is in stock, and individuals who have their bank account Want to check by phone.
Development of intelligent storage and handling systems to optimize product quality.
New developments in the field of biotechnology enable novel approaches to reduce quality losses and to develop environmentally friendly storage and handling systems.
-On the Levels 03 and 04 in direct connection with the camp and the loading zone (sections FG. Gh. GM and MN): The workshops for the printing and distribution as well as the rooms of the maintenance services;
This service takes care of removals, warehousing (including warehouses in Overijse) and insurance and inventory inventory.
However, this could not be achieved because the negotiating conference was unable to dispel the differences of opinion on certain fundamental issues (in particular on the question of the general scope of the camps, their distribution to the Member States, the Details of the participation of developing countries in warehousing and price levels at which the camp intervenes by admission or levy).
The Council has decided to increase the monthly surcharges for the 1981/82 marketing year by about 20% in order to take account of the development of the storage and financing costs of cereal storage and the need to store stocks of cereals in accordance with the Market needs.
This increase, which applies to cereals, flour of wheat and rye and to coarse and Feingries wheat, has been adopted under the objectives of the basic regulation on cereals and in consideration of the storage and financing costs of cereal storage in the community and the The need to discontinue the stocks of cereals in a way that does not cause market disturbances.

While the staff working in the business premises need a lower qualification, the people responsible for warehouse management and data technology need a far higher level of education and training.
Changes in inventories may be determined either as the difference between the stock at the end of the reporting year and the balance of the stock in the course of the reporting year, or as a difference between the additions to the warehouse and the disposals from the warehouse.

Therefore, a high degree of elasticity compared to the share of capital inflows to the assets of a low adjustment of the warehouses.
Apart from losses due to the ongoing storage, processing and transport difficulties, the supply will decline because the farmers, who, after the increase in the state purchase prices in May 1990, obviously expect a further price increase, the Hoarding of cereals.
Obviously, the partially degraded warehouses in the spring are replenished somewhat in front and between products.
The development prospects for production, for their part, remain positive, even if they worsen by one point (+ 5 versus + 6) and thus reach their July level again, which is undoubtedly with the somewhat less favourable expectations regarding the extent of the stock Non-sold finished goods (+ 12 Versus + 11) (table 2).

The dumping in the mines will be 1985 considerable (especially in the UK), but almost fully compensated by an increase in the stocks in the UK's power stations.
Thus, at the end of August 1975, with 960 000 T, the ninth community held almost 1 mill, T (1974 322 000 T) in stock, although production 1974 compared to 1973 had decreased by 2.4% and the increase in the first months of 1975 (January to April) with 6.2% does not seem so spectacular.
In recent years, preservation, storage and transport technology for dairy products have been developed, disseminated and cheapened to the extent that the nationwide supply of all dairy products is practicable today.
The Bayesian requirement is satisfied if all goods stored in a particular room are transferred ("Room security contract") or if items which are to be transferred from the warehouse are individually labelled ("marking contracts").
However, the market can also be supported by more resilient measures, such as aid for storage or distillation, withdrawal by producer groups, among others.
Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the cases of abuse relieves Pope Georg Ratzinger.
This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann says.
The final report on the Missbrauchskandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen continues for discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reform movement "we are Church", declared after publication to the German press agency, he expects from the former Regensburg bishop and present-day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the director Georg Ratzinger, The 93-year-old brother of emeritus Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.
It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret about their own omissions or their erroneous assessment of the operations at the time.
The Vatican newspaper "L'Osservatore Romano", on the other hand, criticized the fact that "double standards" were measured in the reporting of violence in the Domspatzen.
As far as the assaults in Regensburg are concerned, no one doubts that they are "shameful and shameful deeds" that must be punished and prevented in the future; The "degree of medial manipulation", according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee, was conspicuous.
"The habit of denoteing the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of the everyday experience and is preparing public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with the Bavarian radio: "You like to go to the church and this is a found food".
She also pointed out that in her youth "blows were a normal educational means" to cope with naughty children, as I was one. "
It would be unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on the abuse cases, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger also appeared frequently.
Quite wrongly, writes author and historian Michael Hesemann, who, with Ratzinger, wrote the commemorative tape "My Brother the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is in the 440-page report that the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who was appointed by the Bishopric of Regensburg, presented with the Enlightenment?
A total of 547 Regensburg Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of assaults, 67 Domspatzen.
The final report says Georg Ratzinger, who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "In summary, it can be said that from director R. In many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence were used.
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more violent.
Nevertheless, contrary to many other accused people, many victims have appreciated the general humanity of R. And, in many cases, have even combined positive memories with him in spite of violence. "
In the interview, Hesemann explains why, in his opinion, the final report on the abuse scandal at Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of the exercise of violence against protection ordered by the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of director Georg Ratzinger.
On the one, many students emphasize his "humanity".
On the other, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who often became tangible when a Domspatz musically did not bring top performance.
How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble and read the whole 440 page long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in the first place.
He is dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the horrific cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence in preschool also occurred outside of his sphere of influence.
It is possible to accuse him of being too late or to have taken first hints seriously enough.
The Domspatzen Gymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as-so literally-"salvation", "Heaven" and "Better World".
The vast majority of his disciples, Georg Ratzinger, also presented a very excellent testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted", "popular", "sincere", "competent" and "understanding", as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly treats the boys with cakes, biscuits and Sweets and was "always moved by grapes from children".
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to outbursts.
That he not only slammed with chairs and threw the keychain on the floor, but also spread slaps and too naughty boys on his hair or ears, he himself already admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
In his honor, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the time in question, the 1960s and 1970s, among parents and teachers.
Do you know any such Züchtigungs methods?
Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.
I too have experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.
In comparison with what is actually in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at pre-school, that is, of course, trivia.
One wonders whether it is not more with his notoriety and his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just fallen on him.
Many who have never understood him are still working diligently on the Bavarian pope.
But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!
In the media, in connection with the report, a great deal has been reported on the subject of abuse at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
In the final report, will Georg Ratzinger also be burdened with any involvement or complicity in relation to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Quite clearly no.
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted themselves to the director.
Not even the parents were privy.
"I have never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one concerned representative for the others, "it was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem with the Enlightenment of sexual abuse was and still is that most of the victims are silent in shame.
If they were not even entrusted to parents and siblings, they would certainly not be a choir leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators of the profession.
How do the Domspatzen students evaluate Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: One interviewed student put it this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely findings and could have halted the offender.
I think it... even for being really absurd to assume that it is precisely him... Jacks more forceful or clearer or more open than to their parents, boarding directors, trust teachers etc.
That you talk to him about sex...-Unthinkable. "
So the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "That pupils and/or their environment involved in the run-up were entrusted to him, could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation".
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free from any complicity.
Thus, he cannot be accused of not preventing or displaying him.
There is therefore no reason to link his good name with these obnoxious crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media there was much to read about "violent excesses" at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
The former director Georg Ratzinger is accused of "looking away" in the report.
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That is the big problem, that in the reporting everything was mixed and blended into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the midst of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is again an abuse of the report.
Because it is separated cleanly: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violent excesses as well as, let us say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, i.e. also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choirmaster of the Domspatzen.
All the terrible thrashing pedagogy, the cases in which boys were harassed and being slighted by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly, all occurred at preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous States must have prevailed.
But director Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only got to face the boys when they were already at the Domspatzen Gymnasium.
On which, as most of the witnesses pointed out, the subject of "pre-school" was taboo.
One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacal" states.
What was different about the Domspatzen gymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases, despite violence, they even combine positive memories with him".
So, at most, there is still the accusation of having looked.
But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the conditions at preschool.
The first time in 1970/71, when he was about to establish himself and from the processes at a school where he did not work and was responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then only again at 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut his ears before the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because already 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzen Gymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In this he points out that "in preschool the caning continues to be punished".
Already in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when floggings were also banned in Bavaria long ago.
Before that they were in a legal grey area, as each of us probably still knows.
It was also difficult for him to assess where the persons concerned might have exaggerated or dramatized, and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he always looked out.
That's just not true.
Only in the year 1980 the caning was officially abolished in schools in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "pitfall of the anachronism", that is, the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.
The Princess is right.
But this does not, of course, apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times and not for what was broken in preschool to tribulations and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond what was then usual.
It's all awful and I'm glad it's finally being worked out.
But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishing, i.e. slaps and pulling on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When corporal punishment was then banned, he also kept strictly on it.
What picture of his time in Regensburg did Georg Ratzinger play for the book "My Brother the pope" in the talks with you?
Was the subject of caning also discussed?
Michael Hesemann: Well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, that the Domspatzen played only a supporting role.
Nevertheless, I am not in any way concealing that he led a strict regiment there.
But this too must be said: Without this perfectionism, without the demand for unconditional discipline, it would have been hardly possible for him to form a world-class institution from the hitherto more nationally known Regensburg Domspatzen, true Cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and candies alone, the unruly boys do not make great singers and stand before every success, in whatever field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
As for what person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks about your book?
Michael Hesemann: By working on the book and Beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger quite well and again and again experienced as a wonderful, humorous, reasonably good, deeply believer and heart-loving person, from whom one cannot imagine that he Even a fly could do something.
I regularly get to see how many former Domspatzen today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly keep in touch with him, visit him, read him aloud-he is almost blind-and treat him like a member of her family.
Those who do not forgive him to this day, that he once was strict to them, are thus clearly in the minority.
Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them to the world of music.
And that he is always a good, paternal teacher-a stern father, certainly, that may be-but it was also a lovable respecting person, to whom they still look up today and which they downright adore.
And please, once again, quite clearly: all that is being reproached to him are educational methods that were at that time the order of the day.
We can be glad that we have long since overcome this time.
But it is most unfair to make a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother, the media scapegoat.
The evil intention behind it is all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves him.
Now the decency would be to finally let a 93-year-old man, who has earned himself great merits, and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany, no one would know the Regensburg Domspatzen, at last in peace.
With all the difficulties and the scarcity of resources in the implementation of these missions, I can make the pleasing statement that last year we have also succeeded in achieving the commitment of the United Nations in Tajikistan and in the Central African Republic.
