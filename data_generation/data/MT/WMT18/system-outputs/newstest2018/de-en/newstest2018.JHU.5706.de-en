Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
An Irish institution where young people are supposed to meet today.
A pit chapel, where is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small gardeners manage the former reason of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to days.
It's annoying when maps aren't up to date.
This is familiar to anyone who has had to get excited because the Auto-Navi displayed a green meadow instead of a bypass.
The historical maps of the digital Bavaria atlases, a bid by the state government's Geoportals Bayern, are far from up-to-date - but that is precisely why it is very revealing.
Especially if you compare them to current online maps.
It then becomes clear how towns and cities in the distribution area of Munich's Mercury have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that, as such, is not recognized in the same way.
More detailed maps, known as position sheets, have been incorporated into the large overview map for towns and cities.
According to the Bavarian surveying administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and are the result of the first surveying of Bavaria.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader has occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a topographical recording of Bavaria - for military purposes, of course.
Even though the French troops finally pulled out with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801: It was today's neighbours who created the idea of a blanket Bavaria map.
Elector Max IV. Joseph continued to drive the project, establishing the "Topographical Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian surveying administration.
The position sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and, like all the others, can be found on the website of the Bavarian National Library.
The comparison Early / Today is most impressive on the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and grown together.
An example of this is subsendling, which still appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated as a Munich district 21 years after the map was created, that is, in 1877.
Today, Untersendling is in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserstraße, which was only named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers "uprising against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, you see nothing but fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a smaller-scale map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: Handwritten numbered flurries from the so-called "primeval" from which the land tax was derived.
Small parcels no longer occupy farmers there today - but small gardeners of the "Land in the Sun" plant.
A large green area is located north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, the site of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact still a meadow - not a concrete desert - in the 19th century.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the area of the present district of Au-Haidhausen you can read not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the hill "Auf der Lüften" - but also in big letters "Irren Anstalt."
Yes, here on Auerfeldstrasse, you once shut down people with madness.
The Munich circle-Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüften" was founded there in 1858 / 59.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - that psychiatrist brought in connection with the death of King Ludwigs II.
"He was progressive for his time and, for example, ended up anchoring the so-called Irish.
He also prohibited staff from using force against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.
There was room for 280 patients at first, and later expanded to 500 places.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar in 1905.
The Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of the largest psychiatrists in Germany, has been located there since 2006.
In the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people are now meeting in the Salesianum in Munich.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training establishments.
To the west is the football pitch of the TSV München Ost, east residences dating back to the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural reference to the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed in bombing raids in World War II.
The Marienplatz was listed as the "main square" around 1856, and the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse."
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs ripped many holes into the city centre in December 1944.
A big one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval pit chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where the groundwork is taking place these days and the spate of spades for the second S-Bahn regular line on April 5, 2017.
With the slider, you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.
He reports that those waiting in queues for the security check keep asking what the problem is and receive the response "There's no problem" from security officials.
By and large, it ran smoothly in most places when it was quite inefficient in hospital as well - people dug in a long queue. '
I left the polling station at 5pm and the queue was about a kilometre long.
A snake in front of a Takoyaki shop.
Ahmad Shuja uploaded a photo via Twitter showing people standing in a long queue to receive their electoral map.
At some polling stations in Malawi, the queues were so long that people could not see the polling station at the end of the queue.
"Today the snake is long," she notes as she goes.
Normally there is an extra queue for students.
"And they closed the queue for the students, but that's important," Vicki continues, ignoring Arlet.
Civil rights group releases travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the promotion of people of color has issued a warning for colored people traveling to Missouri due to the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, due to come into effect by August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling through the state, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents occur recently throughout the state and are noted here," the group's opinion states.
A recent Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
'They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten up or killed, "the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told the Kansas City Star.
'We're hearing complaints at such a frequency that we haven't heard yet. '
It is the first such warning the organization has issued for a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist offenses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year after he had no gasoline while traveling through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The council also points to a recent report from the Missouri attorney general's office showing that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
'People need to be prepared whether to bring in chewing money or let relatives know they're travelling through the state. '
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, which ranks the state 16th in the country in terms of the number of such injuries.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Earlier in the day, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU says will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
There are about 13 establishment centres in the northwestern border province, and there are 30 other camps in Belutchistan, but they are smaller.
It is no longer possible to look at the problem from the point of view of participation or non-participation and thus move to one of the two opposing camps.
At the moment, in southern Afghanistan, logistical camps, rolling transports and the expansion of world airports are creating the military conditions for getting to grips with Beluchistan and reaching the Indian Ocean.
The hospitals and police clinics, as well as the camps near the border, were looted.
There are guarded United Nations camps day and night.
The Israeli government assured the presidency that security measures around Palestinian camps would be strengthened.
With the reopening of the camps, with the police raiding the neighborhoods of ordinary people, and with mass arrests in the early hours of the morning, the regime wanted to brutally, in our view, scandalously, respond to the ever-growing discontent and popular anger at the regime's difficulties and economic failures.
This organisation has limited responsibility for helping refugees living outside the camps.
Indeed, there are countries where there is a kind of revolt around the camps, because the local population has the impression that the refugees in the camps are better than themselves.
Their camps are being bombed.
They preserve as reminders and symbols the camps of torture and the workshops of death.

Mr President, I will end with the simple statement that we are happy with the electoral process, but not so much with demobilisation, because the Honduran Government has prevented the international organisations mentioned in the Tela Convention from visiting the Contras' camps recently.
This puts it in the camp of the brakes of European development, of those who see the strengthening of the EC as a provocation towards Moscow and Eastern Europe, which is a very regrettable development.
We welcome everything the Commission has done and I am sure that the Commissioner will insist on a thorough investigation of the camps during his visit to the camps.
Many died in resistance, while others fled to camps in neighbouring Papua New Guinea (PNG), but they can't feel safe there either.
I agree with the honourable Member on the importance of preserving the concentration camps for future generations as a testimony to the Nazi crimes against humanity, but I believe that the sites of several camps have already been placed under the constant protection of the competent national and local authorities for the reason mentioned by the honourable Member.
I visited a different camp than Mrs Ewing: A camp of 97 000 refugees on the border with Somalia, which was maintained by non-governmental organisations, the European Community and other donors.
Without naming names, I would like to say that there are two camps in the 'Neinsagern'.
However, it seems that several of these camps are under the constant protection of the competent national and / or local authorities.
I thought the old leftist and Rousseau's utopia had long been buried, responsible for the millions of deaths of the gulag and the camps of Communist China.
Parts of the population are deported to camps in the Arab north, with the sole aim of depriving the people of the Nuba of their Christian faith and culture.
The Community and its Member States have also condemned the existence of detention centres, especially in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and called for the camps to be opened immediately for international inspection and resolved as quickly as possible.
By the way, this can also be blamed on the Lebanese Government, which, with its refusal to allow the deported Palestinians into the country, and also with its refusal to allow aid agencies access to the temporary camp, has no other objective than to exploit the matter for political purposes to the detriment of Israel.
For several weeks now, following the discovery of the camps, we have been discovering the rapes.
This attention and financial support must not be limited to the camps located within the territory of the Community, but must also apply, if not above all, to the camps located in the rest of Europe.

One-size-fits-all project is basic
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year.
The CDU's Peter White and Kordula Kovac took a picture on the ground.
Representatives of the Fishermen's CDU local association, along with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies, met at the Schwendemann family's legal tomb.
Markus Schwendemann initially granted insights into his farm, where he manages 55 acres of meadows and 40 acres of forest, supplies 40 dairy cows and as many juveniles, and houses holiday homes in five apartments.
For him, "Black Forest milk" is the aging marketing route for the milk of his cows, according to Schwendemann.

As a result, the disclosure area is 40 hectares, which may not be forested until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of €71 500, half was funded through Leader, with a quarter carried by the municipality of Fischerbach.
As a result, farmers were left with EUR 12 610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of wheat.

The disclosure area is 35 hectares and the calculated cost is more than EUR 112 000.

Now the White House is taking the Statue of Liberty from Trump
The surest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
Americans value them as much as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein in the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump regime's key ideologues, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta about the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have lynched him if he did.
But he attacked its significance, and in particular the importance attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed.
When Miller labeled Acosta, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you refer to, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. '
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, it's not really about history.
It's about the contemporary resonance to the awkward words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your fatigues, your poor, / your beleaguered masses who yearn to breathe freely, / the elating waste of your rich shores."
There was never a time when the "elated waste" was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's United States.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute: It is, in fact, a conflict over the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who set out to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that she was performing a highly political act.
The sculpture was meant to show the connections between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classic pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed that meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of the exiles.
The poem's connection with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this back for a long time.
The great shrimp Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone, but rather an early neo-conservative bringing the American flame to the surging world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is designed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not meant to illuminate the way to the United States. '
Quite unusually, Limbaugh has come across something here.
The significance of the statue is entirely a matter of the position of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, elated but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It is, in the truest sense, about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.
And, of course, that's not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not meant to illuminate the path, but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of UK team
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots were part of the Great Britain team
UK athletics performance director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the world championship squad will "make a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which kicks off on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and the UK's athletics needs to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we're trying to understand it, and we're going to continue it until we figure it out," Black said.
'i speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it's something to do with what they've done.
Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant. '
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle has been elected team captain by the team.
'Eilidh is pretty humble.
Your captain's speech was incredible, "Black says.
'a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, walked out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh brought in quite naturally was great. '
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth world championships, says it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's best total number of athletes to date at the World Cup was seven achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The middle-distance runner, Muir, is leading the way and last year set five British and two European records.
She will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500m, is another Scot to watch after a great season that included winning the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "hugely proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is because she was chosen by the other members of the team so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added.
"Obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots who are part of the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to get on podiums.
As for my speech as captain?
Yes, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.
So it's really important to put on that home support and benefit from being back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such a great atmosphere out there. '
The key to the website was our desire to create an audio platform that provides a space for emerging talent from a wide variety of areas in the region.
Overall, the EP supported the harmonisation proposals by a large majority, although some of the victims of those involved and certain deviations from the usual policy in some Member States were called for, because it was clear that, without harmonisation of cost factors and legislation, no major progress could be made towards greater freedom of movement.
The need, the benefits and the gradual implementation of such a project must be recognised and felt by all, so that the efforts and necessary sacrifices are made on a voluntary basis.
But how can we demand these sacrifices from our peoples, our constituents, when the same voters read about such human rights violations every day in the newspaper?
Nevertheless, I believe that farmers are prepared to make these short-term sacrifices so that the health of the people can be improved in the long term.
Mr Berkhouwer has pointed out how bitter this is for the athletes who have made sacrifices for years, taking deprivation to attend this event.
This is not about refusing to make a sacrifice, but about the time impossibility of returning to the constituency and coming back in time on Monday morning.
The devotees of Tunis have not died for otherwise if their victim makes a legitimate charge against the regime of Bourguiba, this sprout of the so-called free world, and if they are confirmation of the need to oppose human rights abuses wherever they may occur.
They are certainly words she pronounced with the feeling of a woman, a Democrat, an anti-fascist fighter who knew the victim.
This is testified by the dedication and sacrifices - including to people - to which some of the newlyweds were ready for this country and its people and continue to be ready by placing troop contingents with the UN peacekeeping forces.
But communicating credible values also means convincing others that, if necessary, they are also prepared to make sacrifices for these values.
In view of this situation, it seems logical that, in return for the sacrifices made to milk producers, a co-responsibility levy should also be levied on the fats of plant and maritime origin imported into the Community on preferential terms.
This also explains the heroic sacrifice of Bobby Sands, O'Hara, Hughes, MacCreesh and, sadly, Joe MacDonnell, who died yesterday after a sixty-day hunger strike, who enjoy the approval and support of Irish Catholics and much of European and global public opinion.
This is meant by the word 'victim'.
Our notion demands some sacrifice on the part of the rich.
The Olympic fighters from many countries, who valiantly made a tremendous personal sacrifice, also believed that the Community would keep its promise.
The fact that we impose heavy sacrifices on ourselves is of no use if our competitors exploit it for their own growth.
And the success of the Camp David agreement just shows that, for the first time in history, the military victors have made material sacrifices for peace to return.
This action - to put it bluntly - will require a great deal of sacrifice, particularly from the population and the workers, victims who must seem haunted if they do not quite obviously find their justification in the efficiency of the plants and a sufficient balance between the surplus and the deficit of production and consumption per head of the individual Member States.
Thirdly, account must be taken of the great efforts and sacrifices that Luxembourg has made to restructure its steel industry since the beginning of the steel crisis, that is, since 1975.
Enlargement would pose a dramatic threat to the Spanish fishing industry, and even this sacrifice could not prevent our production capacity from being significantly curtailed.
Considerable concerns have been expressed about the fact that victims - because sacrifices were eventually demanded - should be put on an equal footing by farmers in all countries.
We state very firmly that we do not have our backs to the wall and we do not need to impose new sacrifices on small and medium-sized farmers; it is also different.
The agriculture ministers were realistic and I know that all our farmers will be prepared to make some sacrifices to promote the long-term viability and stability of the common agricultural policy.
However, the victims must be evenly distributed among the Member States, and I firmly reject the idea that British farmers should be worse off than their European counterparts.
In view of the fact that we all have to take part in the happy and unpleasant events of the Community in the same way, and that it now requires sacrifices if the economy is to be reinstated, we accept the price reduction proposals in the Woltjer report.
The members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats even go so far as to call for a fair distribution of victims in the resolution they have signed with others.
We must also remember that if the democratic parties of Europe had been vigilant and determined, this sacrifice of so many might not have been necessary.
However, these efforts must continue for a while, otherwise all the sacrifices that have already been made, particularly in terms of jobs, would have been pointless.
A civilised state must avoid the sacrifice of the innocent.
The economic losses, the number of human victims in the fight against fires, the costs are so high that they can no longer be borne by individuals, by the Autonomous Communities, by the municipal and local authorities, leading to serious economic shocks.
Of course, the reduction mentioned fell victim to several important parts of the programme, including, in particular, research in the field of aviation.
It would therefore be unfair just to commemorate one part of the victims and not to mention the other part.
Now, anyone with a bit of common sense knows that you have to be able to make compromises and make sacrifices if you live together to twelve.
Through this sacrifice, they effectively managed to shake up the international conscience and trigger a wave of solidarity with the Afghan people, which is now culminating in this victory.
But in the name of what goal are we asking for all these great efforts, all these upheavals, all these sacrifices?
In line with these efforts, producers outside the Community should make similar sacrifices if we are to achieve a more stable balance on world markets.
The Polish people, who have been suffering for years from the shortage and scarcity of basic products, have just embarked on an ambitious process of rehabilitation and economic reform which will require further efforts and sacrifices from this courageous and patient people.
An extreme sacrifice is now being demanded of the families of the workers at Sellafield.
Only then will all the soldiers of Europe, whose blood, as an invisible ornament for the victims of the past, have encircled the door shaft of every house in this area and tweaked every plot in fields, meadows and gardens, only then will all these soldiers who have fallen in battle be able to rest in peace!
On the contrary, they would lead to increased social and national sacrifices, especially for the most vulnerable nations.
They have worked generation by generation and made heavy sacrifices.
I am told that every country must make sacrifices to build a well-organised, integrated and efficient community, both small and large.
Pakistan is a country that has already made great sacrifices in the war in Afghanistan with the arrival of millions of refugees.
Beyond these very general plans, we should not forget that there are special cases, such as the case of Poland, which, as a whole, were the first to initiate this process of democratisation and which, when it was ready to make sacrifices, have already become a demonstration of what our world policy will be and what our real intentions are.
Parliament is to agree to measures that make the United States conciliatory, but which demand a great sacrifice from the European farmer.
The sinking of fishing boats by submarines can be avoided, and I urge the Commission and the governments of the Member States to agree immediately on appropriate procedures to ensure that the Antares team was the last victim our fishermen brought to the Cold War.
We knew that war was the victim of politics.
I believe that the Council must ensure that something is done for the minorities that remain, including in a smaller Yugoslavia; in particular, the victims in Bosnia-Herzegovina also need attention.
The one-net rule being proposed will impose different hardships and sacrifices on fishermen in different regions and waters that will not be fair by the bank.
While this is a unique achievement in the history of international shipping (thanks to the self-sacrifice of the crew and the captain's flawless coordination of rescue operations under extraordinarily difficult weather conditions, there was not a single casualty), the deliberate slander was guided by low motives of unfair competition.
We will all have to make sacrifices in our way of life, production and consumption.
Secondly, it is important to strengthen the principle of safety and environmental protection, to raise standards and European and international controls throughout the cycle, from shipbuilding to ports and shipping; this is essential in order to halt the negative spiral that has led to ever more numerous and serious accidents in recent years and to prevent a ferocious competition that is increasingly sacrificing quality and safety.
Therefore, both the authorities and the public of Morocco have used their connection with the Community as an essential element in their internal political discussion, precisely because they have had the opportunity to "sell" to their own people, so to speak, that it is necessary for a more stable and better future to take on these victims.
I wish governments would take an example of such people who show more commitment and make greater sacrifices in the face of such a human tragedy.
The question, however, is whether we have the means to achieve our objectives and whether we have the courage to explain to our respective populations what sacrifices they have to make so that we can use sufficient resources to achieve our objectives.
Of course, the necessary restructuring cannot be guided by selfishness, but by a clear attitude on the part of the Commission, so that the sacrifices of the social partners and the investment efforts of recent decades will not have been in vain.
In my country, beef is the most important agricultural export item - no other product has this significance - and because we export 80% of our total beef production, the whole GATT issue has enormous weight for us, and it is fairly certain that we will have to pay more than the sacrifices that have already been made in the CAP.
The reorganisation of the market and the balance between supply and demand are to be found in the restriction of production, although this solution is difficult given the sacrifices involved.

Blocking critics over Facebook: Don't apply for public office if you can't fault the encroachment of voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to beat him because of everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
He shrugs at the criticism, for sure.
But he has not silenced his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we are led to slaughter like the sheep."
Which brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hodge's staff have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
And that's why the American Civil Liberties Union indicted him earlier this week.
The governor's bar dismissed the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Na, and?."
"It's just Facebook," a lot of people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state that is remarkably popular.
He has the second-highest endorsement of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary heathead.
He has shown a firm hand in leading his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very adept at using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his constituents and playfully debuting his hapless head after chemotherapy on his side.
As a result, blocking people coming to the governor's side - which is a public forum called official and by employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hodge's spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people swinging the whip online.
The Post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people talking to their elected leaders: A teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profound.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn't hate-filled, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the comments section of The Post news outlet.
'i don't appreciate this idea either, when a number of people take a stand on the same issue, they are more likely to be disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort and not recognised as a large group of citizens affected. '
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" would likely call others "advocacy."
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past, if you had done the same, that staff were dispatched to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or to arrest and silence protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening digitally right now.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for impacting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on the issue fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable portion had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers suggested his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers laying down Washington's decisions.
Petitions that criticised his position on the Amity contract, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historic documents collected by the George Washington Project's Online Papers.
But he didn't silence them.
Freedom of speech, difference of opinion and discourses are the foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
A week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks said MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley ordinary shares at the uniform price of $25.25, making a total of $3 billion.
The accepted price is less than 19% of the share price of 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in acquiring convertible shares, which will secure it a 10 per cent profit and can be sold again at a cost of $31.25.
The last few weeks have been tough for the group, which has had to watch its stock price fall by half as the price of insurance against default soared.
That price declined on Monday but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
On the 17th, two dead women wrapped in blankets were discovered in the village of Zoquiapan of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the next morning in Huixquilucan, the body of a man wrapped in a yellow-blue blanket was found likely to be Mario Ríos, according to the news his killers left next to him.
With dense smog burning in the throat and laying like a blanket over China's larger cities in a matter of days, improving air quality in China is one of the most urgent matters in terms of environmental protection.
This is to say that they should invest more in innovative projects than in those that offer "safe social returns" - for example, a certain number of blankets made with a donation.
The ADQ has vowed to support the government's adoption of a Plan North.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort at Renaissance Club
Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who led next door at the Archerfield Links until the final round last year before losing to Paul Eales, is linked with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen the Renaissance club built, and we see how he achieves his fame with this event," Rafferty said.

An existing movement that stirred for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea encompassing the eastern part of the island.
The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive by car.
There is no public transport.
The town, which has a population of about 19,000, is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated metal roofs converted by rust into various yellow-brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans honored a god named Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes as well.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, hinting at her lively, hand-woven turban, her dark shirt and her bright skirt.
'in the past we only had leaves on our bodies. '
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's Goldland.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoRan of Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province the size of New Jersey with a population of 153,000.
In 2015 alone, Freeport, worth $3.1 billion, mined gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for Papua, which ensure Indonesia's powerful military retains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 investigation in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gans and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in dad's tribal highlands in the 1970 "s became genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
"We are scoring all losing," says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which includes reports of last year's atrocities, such as unlawful executions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular, according to another report - and the brutal defeat of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have intensified as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The province's population of 3.5 million residents is 83% Christian, but demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to keep up here.
"The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura for work.
'it's cost local Papua - the mum's mum [the women] of Papua - their market. '
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised to address inequalities and rights violations in Papua during his 2014 campaign.
The former Zimmerman secured 27 of Papua's 29 districts - including Paniai - en route to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua and today locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, just two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October, Paniai suffered a low point.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorbike.
The terrified children told them to turn their headlights on.
One of the soldiers took kick-off on her tone and later came back with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had been drinking chased and beat the group with their rifles, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, the nearby government commission's building was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting arches and performed the Waita dance - ongoing in circles and imitating a birdsong - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began tossing stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, the soldiers were sent a command via an internal radio: "If the crowds resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," says an official document from TIME that was not released to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of Enarotali's Kego Koto district, saw the imminent danger and called for calm and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, a lot of shots were fired," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was," Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, bears only one name, told TIME in a grim mood.
'i saw he was dead... I kicked him. '
Papua police chief inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because it was being attacked.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," the spokesman for Papua police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, said in 2015.
'it's all about life and death. '
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more wounded.
News of the killings only came 'filtered' to Jakarta the following day.
Three weeks ago, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the historic grievances in Papua.
"I want this case resolved immediately so it won't happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an out-of-court mechanism to settle historic human rights abuses.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
'Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90 "s and early 2000" s.
The point is that we have committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to go through, "he said.
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, whom the UN has charged with "crimes against humanity," which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights abuses in Papua had already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims took such claims with grim incredulity.
"I've been interviewed four times over the last three years, but there's been no progress whatsoever," Yohanes says.
'i'm tired. '
He says that years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
'i'm afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid of being shot. '
His brother, Yacobus, repeated the view that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military searched for me," he says.
The gunmen have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniais neighborhood of Deiyai.
One person died and 17 others were injured, including children, during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to take an unconscious man to hospital.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned when he was fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company's location office.
Police said villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one.
"We were so panicking, we are afraid there will be revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here, according to TIME.
'i've been hiding in my house for two days. '
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and for the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a source of trouble for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of tribal members Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in Papua's green highlands.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend Papua's rights by inciting sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years on the pretext of "securing national sovereignty."
Some never appear again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty strengthens discontent.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here are building everything they eat: Especially nota and fruit and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women, who can each handle four or five fields of sweet potato.
They keep most of the crop for the family, while the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between native Papua and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting remain strained by international media.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions despite being given rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi's campaign to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new dangers to foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and Westpapua: Visa denial and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
A lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to Papuan's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta: "A democratic system is still in place in Indonesia and there is free media so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and pressed him "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but wishes to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 but the Papua say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shootings," says Gobai, the leader of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor educational and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like others Papua, view their vote for Jokowi as a "guilt" he has to repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shot victims carried out one last symbolic act of comfort: The body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they don't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus says with a lowered head.
'What else can we do? '
Fires capture Dubai's' Torch 'skyscraper for second time
A fire took hold in one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-foot-high, 79-story building.
It is the second fire to blow through the skyscraper in just two years, which is accidentally called the Torch Tower (torch tower).
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame.
'We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and when people were screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor, "one resident, who gave his name as George, told Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said fire control units extinguished the fire at 4: 00 a.m. local time (00: 00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working to provide accommodation for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.

No Davis Cup reform: Continue best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has fallen through with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho-Chi-Minh City, the proposal, revolutionary for this sport to play Davis Cup singles only on two winning sets, was skinny not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
So the five-set classics, which are often very long, but also therefore highly valued, remain the trajectory.
63.54 per cent of member states voted in favour of the reform, so ITF president David Haggerty's target was only narrowly missed.
"We respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire package of reforms for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic contests, "Haggerty said.
We will continue to work to improve the applications.

Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the assassination of Catalonia, several thousand dollars had been sent through a money transfer company that were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "commandos" that put an end to the lives of 106 people.
As is generally known, the two players lost time a couple of minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls so the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and as Real Madrid would lead their group, the two players will meet the mandatory sanction in the next league game against the Auxerre, thus entering the next stage of the game without any cards.
The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice; it is more common in the world of football.
The advantage, obviously, is that players begin the next stage of the Champions League without any cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
The year 2011 was supposed to end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phone), with more than 6 billion units sold, according to Eurosmart.
The most compelling segment here is contactless technology, which allows payments on public transport or settling purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Their market share should increase further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent more than 10% of the global smart card market (6.925 million cards).
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
'Jane, your little feet are naked; put yourself in bed to me and blanket you with my blanket. '
On the other side of the square were tent buds, where cotton enclosures, blankets and stockings were haggled, alongside horse shields and clusters of colorful ribbons whose ends fluttered in the winds.
He asked K. to extend a blanket to him from the canapee.
K. picked up the blanket and said, "They put up with a chilling quite unnecessarily."
Throwing off the blanket was quite simple; he just needed to blow himself up a little bit and she fell by herself.
But then Mr and Mrs samsa, everyone on his side, hurried out of bed, Mr samsa threw the blanket over his shoulders, Ms samsa only emerged in the night-themed; so they entered Gregor's room.
In a small, dirty room, whose ancestral wall-making was arduous and through whose thin wall you could hear a next-door conversation, in an air filled with the suffocating smell of unclean things, a body wrapped in a blanket lay on a bed demolished from the wall.
The one arm of this body was located above the ceiling, and the tremendously large, a Harke-like hand was incomprehensibly attached to a thin, long stick equally strong from the beginning to the middle.
It didn't even come to his mind to establish all the details in the condition of the sick, to think about how that body lay there under the ceiling, in what curved attitude these emaciated thighs and hips and this lean back were stored, and whether it was not somehow possible to store them better, to do something so that the sick, if it wasn't actually better for him, didn't have it quite as bad.
The drawer was brought up, the body laid out, wrapped with a blanket and stuck with knitting.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. travelers bring banned items to the plane, a survey finds
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously smuggled prohibited items past the U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while accidentally carrying prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed they had belatedly discovered they had mistakenly traveled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers were more likely to disregard the rules.
Of those surveyed who admitted they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items deliberately passed to TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent said they knowingly carried items with blades through security control, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed they had deliberately placed banned drugs on the plane.
The company said it had interviewed travelers around the country to find out how many had accidentally brought contraband through airport security and how many had done it deliberately.
It's no surprise that the people most likely to carry contraband - knowingly or unwittingly - through security were the ones who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure what liquids they may take with them or how much of it.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of items seized by the TSA are banned liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA might view books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Electric-thousandsassa Elon Musk is happy to give up with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3."
In doing so, he has so far understated that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-triumphant numbers on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has betrayed a different, less ghastly figure for the first time when the latest quarterly review was announced: That of cancellations in the new mass-market Model 3.
In recent months, Musk has frequently campaigned with the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, the delivery of which is just beginning.
Now Musk admits that of the total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are merely non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will fully refund the €1000 (US $1000 in the US and £1000 in the UK) "reservation deposit."
There are currently 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk acknowledged in a conference call with analysts.
However, the Tesla chief does not believe that cancelling about 12 percent of all orders so far could become a problem.
His argument is that the challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not on demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, it will be 500,000 - all models combined - and a million in 2020.
The demand for it is obviously there.
According to Musk, 1,800 reservations are currently made per day.
If you order a "Model 3" today, you may not expect delivery until the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines, which have never been tested in practice, without major interruptions with maximum utilization.
Many experts doubt that is possible.
But if there are major delays, then the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company can't prevent unhappy customers from running away in droves.
EPA's Pruitt withdraws for delaying Obama-Era rules to reduce emissions
A day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, took back his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved more responsive to the needs of state environmental agencies than previous administrations.
He did not mention the lawsuit, which had been brought against his previous position in a federal appeals court.
At issue is a deadline that expired on October 1 for states to comply with 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering with local decisions or hampering economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's state attorney before being appointed by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and fossil fuel industry oppose.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay implementation of a rule by the Obama administration that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued Wednesday night, Pruitt suggested that his U-turn on ozone standards quite simply strengthens the EPA's willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely meeting the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indicted by activist groups and others, and to set the date for implementation in an agreement," said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
'We don't believe in regulation through court proceedings and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and authority it gives us seriously. '
Still, the EPA's opinion said Pruitt will eventually use his "power to delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure the rules are "based on sound policies and the best available information."
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader recasting of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is expected to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal - following our actions - is an important win for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog pouring into their communities," Schneiderman said.
In this case, New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone is created when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered on Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It's worrying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the Trump administration's ideological crusade to pander to polluters and their special interests."
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by an ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines that would like to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate the issue recommended last month that the government allow broader use of personal electronic devices.
One leading trader noted that despite the huge daily volume in foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of their own internal platforms by banks meant that "you can already influence the market with very low ticket prices."

Tumour celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, a serenade will be invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30pm.
With its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the town has made the friends and promoters of Tumlingens their concern.
As Walter Martini points out: "It's a unique village gem."
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the Wuerttemberg Urgent Book: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church on it to Tumlingen and the bird" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 marks of silver.
According to the wording of the document, on the Tumlinger Berg, apart from the former parish church, there was also a magnificent courtyard, which included the church or the right of patronage, and not the other way around.
So people lived there as well.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt in 1858, in addition to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the village of Tumlingen, the "mountain" was the third, the glorious settlement centre of the village.
Old maps dating back to the year 1600 substantiate these historical facts.
The right of patronage arose from the early medieval equity law.
A gentleman who built a church, refunded it, and occupied it with a priest, continued to be the owner of that church and was able to inherit that equity as well.
Associated with this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The biggest of the two zeroed in on Christmas 1673.
The newly created bell then first sounded in 1692, but had to be handed down later in World War II in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the window panes were taken and the bell-siders were stolen.
The roof was unsealed.
In 1796, French troops lagged near the church.
They broke out the chancel and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius Cemetery also served as the final resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilary church was canceled.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On New Year's Eve in 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was canceled.
Only the tower dwarf that still exists today was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "sheepish pensioners" maintain the Hilarius plant in place of Dieter Dockhorn.
As organizers, the friends and supporters of Tumlingens invite the sixth serenade to the old cemetery to the St. Hilarius Chapel on Sunday, July 16.
It is designed by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local resident Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 4: 30 p.m.
Admission is from 3: 30 p.m.
A trunk takes place in front of the cemetery to finish the serenade.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest," the organizers highlight the fantastic view.
The serenade only takes place in dry weather.
The organizers are hoping for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for tumors and hearing welders.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organiser Walter Martini affirms.
Association to allow approval of windmills to be examined
"Boisheim is resisting" does not see a legal requirement for construction and has therefore written to the Councillor.
The "Boisheim wests" association has called on Councillor Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that no wind turbines could have been approved at all at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette, as at the time a wind power concentration zone existed in Viersen only on the city's border with Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines is basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.
Such zones are designed to prevent a "saving" of the landscape.
The city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by changing the land use plan - but it had not been approved by the Duesseldorf district government, due to a form failure.
"Due to the lack of a planning requirement, the permit granted is still illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim wests."
Current state of affairs: The council has again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette ahead of the summer break; a permit from the county government is pending.
Mr Erkens said: "This means that, at this point, the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded."
The circle confirms the receipt of the call.
"The relevant letters have been received at Viersen County since last week," a spokesman said.
The county is taking it as an occasion to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not expected to cause the proceedings to be halted.
With a view to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, the county did not want to comment on the substance of the association's "Boisheim wests" argument on Thursday.
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans to build four windmills, each 200 metres high, on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
As recently as last year, the company, which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved in, closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65-acre site.
The four wind turbines are designed to meet the electricity needs of around 11,400 households - roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-seater households.
The NEW Re aims to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen's council gave the go-ahead for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen, as well as a stake in a wind energy plant in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg County.
'it belongs to us, it's our future, 'he added after taking a theatrical break to view the huge map behind.
So the emphasis on the civil character and the form of association do not merely serve to circumvent legal hurdles that might arise in the course of registration at court - it is also a political strategy.
A court ruled four years ago that Alemán had regularly shifted government money to accounts of foreign firms in Panama.
There is no appeal against today's ruling, only revision to the Supreme Court is possible.
In addition to nearly 20 men in that trial, courts legally recognized Berdych and a number of others as guilty of other robberies.
Other men from Berdych's circle will have to answer in a different trial, and other cases have not yet been brought to court.
The courts have awarded comparatively low damages to those affected so far, the amounts were determined by tables and moved in the range of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.

City and traders plan 'home shopping' weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to rediscover shopping in the city centre in September.
The business association and the city council want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to lure residents to the city centre for shopping.
As the chairman of the business association, Christian King, announced, the "home shopping" weekend aims to raise awareness among customers of what offers their own city offers away from the usual supermarket goods.
The plan is therefore to create a market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local firms are to present themselves with their apprenticeships.
In addition, the shops of the city centre will invite you to "midnight shopping."
In doing so, the action not only targets residents of the city and the surrounding region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, according to Christian King.
The city council and the trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
This will take the business association and the city to another stage of the "Attractive city centre" project.
These include new offerings such as the first "Active Day" to the Brunnenfest and sold-out Sunday, talks with all tradesmen and hosts to encourage them to actively participate.
Attractive offers on Saturday and the abandonment of parking fees that day are also part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential will be reopened or re-opened.
This includes spa guests and tourists.
But many locals would also have lost sight of the city centre when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to help invigorate the city centre - right down to landlords, the businesses of the whole city and clubs.
It was to overcome lethargy with a network that had partly spread, King said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen announced that at the nationwide third "home shopping" day, five Thuringian cities will participate for the first time.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance to the common good of our cities," Mr Streich said.
The action under the auspices of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his purchasing behaviour can influence his direct environment.
So-called 360 ° feedback (from superiors, colleagues and subordinates) best suits mixed cultures - here the willingness to support one another is combined with the assumption that individual achievements can be described.
The report concludes: "To meet global demand, private sector investment needs to increase by a factor of 20-30 to $200-300 billion a year, assuming government and philanthropic funds double."
The essence of the "This time is all different" syndrome lies in the assumption that crises only amount to others.
Behind this is the assumption that behind the longest chain is a majority of users.
Our estimates are based on the assumption that profit growth is in line with consensus expectations.
Under the optimistic assumption that government spending and philanthropy will double over the medium term, private-sector investment must increase by a factor of 20- 30 to meet the required financial needs.
Assuming that the value added of the suppliers is in Switzerland, the purchases of the big banks generate an added value of about 2.4 billion francs and 19 275 jobs.
That the relatively inexpensive pillow has future is a real assumption:

Assuming that the CHF will still depreciate slightly from current levels, we are reducing our forecast for GDP growth in Switzerland for 2015 from 1.6 per cent to 0.8 per cent.

Trump put pressure on Mexico over paying the border wall after leaked transcripts of phone calls
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by The Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a proposed border wall.
The US president seized on him for publicly denouncing the wall, reportedly saying to him: "You can't tell the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States, vowing to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the United States to take on refugees who emigrated to Australia was "ridiculous," "mies" and "stupid," and that the existence on trade brokered by the Obama administration would make him look like a "dump" after he proposed a ban on resettling refugees to the United States.
Mr. Trump ended the call after telling Mr Turnbull, "This is the most unpleasant call for all day."
I was led to a tavern where the conductor asked me to add me to dine; however, as I had no appetite, he left me alone in a large room at whose two ends there was ever a fireplace; a chandelier hung from the ceiling, and at the top of the wall was a small, red gallery on which various musical instruments lay.
My muff and umbrella are on the table, and I am trying to recover from the warmth of the furnace from the stiffness and anaesthesia that a sixteen-hour journey in cold October weather had caused me; at four in the morning, I had left Lowton and the city clock of Millcote was now just smashing the eighth hour.
After I had walked along the long, carpets-covered gallery, I climbed down the shiny blanched oak staircase; here I stood still for a minute; a bronze lamp that hung from the ceiling, a large, old Wanduhr, whose enclosure of oak wood was strangely carved and by time black and blank like ebony.
She climbed down from her chair and came to me to sit on my lap; then she seriously folded her small hands, threw her locks back, stitched her eyes on the ceiling of the room and started singing a tune from some opera.
It was a large, refundable compartment, with purple-coloured furniture and curtains, a Turkish carpet, nude wood-clothed walls, a large stained-coloured window and a richly carved ceiling.
I still see her in her raging passion when we had driven her to the extreme - she poured our tea, crumbled our butter beans, threw our books up to the ceiling and made a colourful mess with the ruler and the writing desk, the camouflage and the firepole.
Right, and faster than she expected: Before she had half-drunk the bottle, she felt her head sticking to the ceiling, and had to bite quickly to avoid breaking her neck.
Through the rites of wood, the sun's rays were stacked with long thin needles on the tiles, or they broke down on the edges of the furniture and twirled up to the ceiling.
"If you knew," she continued, smashing her beautiful eyes, from which tears rolled, to the ceiling, "which I dreamed of everything!"
The interior of the hut was as lapsed as the old one; its walls were tweaked, the beams of the ceiling were blackened, the fireplace collapsed, there was a series of wacky tables and broken stools in the middle, and in the background there was a staircase, or rather a wooden ladder, leading to a case reading in the ceiling.
In this passionate declaration of love, the gypsy sent a glimpse full of heavenly happiness to the dirty blanket that represented the sky here.

A crowds of a wide variety of people - no one cared about the one coming in - filled a medium-sized, two-story room surrounded just past the ceiling by a gallery that was also fully occupied and where people could only stand stocked and sticking to the ceiling with their heads and backs.
But not she was circling, but the man, he had pulled his mouth wide and looked to the ceiling.
Although there was no immediate light access, it was not completely dark, because some departments had, instead of uniform board walls, mere, but up to the ceiling, wooden grids through which some light rang and through which one could also see individual officials as they wrote at tables or were right on the grid and through the gaps watched the people on the aisle.
He liked to hang especially at the top of the ceiling; it was very different from lying on the floor; one breathed more freely; a slight swinging went through the body; and in the almost happy scattering in which Gregor was up there, it could happen that, to his own surprise, he let go and clapped on the floor.

Moores Ford massacre: Activists resume racist lynch act as call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumped onto Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns emerged to block his path.
The leader of the mock - a middle-aged man in a needle-striped suit - took a long train at his cigar and looked checking through the windscreen.
Inside, the inmates were floating in fear.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" The man shouted.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams tore the silence as a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Luckily, this horrible scene, played on July 22, is just a rendition.
But then when a blade is thrown around the neck of "Roger," almost everyone in the audience encountered very real sigh.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have come back to Moore's Ford Bridge to emulate the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It's really unfathomable that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the rendition.
'it's a smear stain on a story but it's a burden on our souls. '
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifetime civil rights activist.
For him, the rendition serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want law enforcement, we want the ending, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he said.
'We can't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice. '
A court medical officer places a bed cloth over the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford Lynch on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process.
But none have ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say the double motivation for the Lynch actions across the city has always been known: Politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote in the summer's primary contest for the first time.
Around the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black color guard Roger Malcom stood down a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumour in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcoms's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they then got away from the jail and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the killings," an FBI report concludes.
'it's also obvious there was a plot between state and local law enforcement that wasn't just involved in the murders, removing evidence and covering up the identity of witnesses. '
Brooks puts it even more succinctly.
"It was a suffrage massacre," he said.
"They were all killed sending a message to black people in this community:" If you register and if you vote, that's what's going to happen to you here. ""
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual rendition of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Her portrayal is vivid, moving, and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and even harder to look away from, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the Lynch because then we are confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said.
'But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through. '
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of blacks - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched a well-played overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director here.
He has played the role of chief clanmember for years, but he said the role never gets any easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Marbaugh said.
'But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return to those times. '
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The play begins with Malcom shouting at Hester and pushing him, furious that he has slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- er, vanish from my property!"
Rascona wields the fire.
There's a pause.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!" Asked Rascona.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," Greene said, still kicking.
'i just don't think white people said 'n --- er' at the time. '
"Yet," one of the other black performers withered.
'You just have to hit the hard 'R.'
And that's where the energy in the room shifts, a sense of companionship replacing the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not just because of the game but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and forcefully.
Absolutely no one is laughing.
This repetition ends violent and fast.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman, wearing a wedding dress, stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holidays's grieving praises "Strange Fruit."
Her voice breaks at every second word.
About a hundred yards behind, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is split almost evenly between black and white.
A couple have travelled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just coming down the street.
They have all experienced Georgia's oppressive moisture for nearly eight hours when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the killings have remained an anecdote, but now, when you're on the same land where the Lynch killings took place, the air feels ghostly.
When the song's final notes finish, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpse.
Children hook on their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," murmurs one little boy, as if to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe away their tears.
BRADSHAW embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clanmember.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his fellow players and then collapses awkwardly in their arms, the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaking out at him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
'We know that's not in your heart.
You did that for a reason. '
Later, the audience will sit down with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta chatted about the rendition with a black couple they've just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words about the feeling the performance has left.
"It's hard to hear these horrible words and actions... coming from people who look like yourself and who do that because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me makes me believe that the Lynch is still going on," she added, "today this is just called police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks is holding court at his table, he's eating and remembering civil rights.
He said he had already started planning next year's performance.
"The rendition is inspirational in a way, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
'it's like if we don't learn anything from it then it can happen again.
Those who don't study their own history, who don't know their own history, are condemned to repeat it. '
'Divine Dawn 'reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf puts on a colorful-frivolous staging in front of a gigantic, six-story setting.
The rotary stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) optionally shows a shabby street corner including Mauerrest and Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elaste" logo from the GDR era, or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes classic car is parked in which the Rhine daughters pose as Rockergirls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels recall Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - that moves through his "ring" staging.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully, as they did in the "Rheingold."
Kess they seduce Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), clasp a body in the boot in Hollywood fashion and give the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully fiddly Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he kicks off Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) also has to believe in it.
The audience thanks it to the ensemble with strong applause.
Precipitously celebrated are Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who is modestly bending his hands to the Merkel Raute.
There is great applause for the Festival Orchestra, which is showing up on stage for the first time - given the great heat back in legless leisure wear.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his Regieteam was eagerly awaited.
Had he yet to have a gleaming pipe concert over in 2013, there was great cheer five years later in which the isolated "Buh" calls went down.
Festival director Katharina Wagner is expected to be pleased with this.
"You notice that the audience grew up with the" ring "in a way," she said shortly before the dpa's performance.
Not only did the audience make a form of peace with Castorf, but it also grew an understanding of its point of view.
I draw a positive resounding.
Nearly everyone -- other than companies like ExxonMobil or U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney and their purchased henchmen and misguided entourages -- understands that carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere when people burn hydrocarbon, and that the CO2 there acts like a huge blanket that absorbs the infrared radiation coming from below and warms the Earth.
Sufficient brightness, good contrast, flickering and mirroring of the screen surface as well as high resolution and correct dimensioning of the characters are important for the readability of the display.
The finer the resolution of the screen, that is, the more "image points" are available per character, the better the readability of the information.
Graphic screens generally have a higher resolution than screens provided only to display letters and digits.

This option has allowed the creation of a high-quality map base, with an expected geometric accuracy of 2.5 m (RMS) and a resolution of 1m.
In this case, with a geometric resolution of 1m, each point can be clearly localized, except for objects whose resolution would be less than 1 meter.
The rule of thumb above must be revised if the geometric resolution of the image is low, that is, if a considerable proportion of the objects whose surface you want to estimate are submerged by the presence of mixed pixies.
On the other hand, there is still a lot of development and research work to be done in the field of agrometeorological models and vegetation monitoring methods with medium-resolution satellites.
Currently, the geographic information system of GEOSTAT contains not only grid and point data with a resolution of 1 ha, but also various vector files.
Integration, management and maintenance of various geocodized, spatial data available in the Swiss federal administration; this data will cover the entire country and have a spatial resolution of 100 m, which corresponds to a map scale of 1: 25 000;
Data on the surface development of a smaller number of land use categories (possibly 20 or less) with a lower spatial resolution and accuracy could be published 1 or 2 times a year to fill the data gap caused by the fact that area statistics based on aerial images can only be produced every 12 years.
The remote sensing provides the data according to geometric mesh of different sizes depending on the resolution of the sensor (pixels).
In addition to the Mercury program, the scale and geometric resolution (the smallest different unit of space), the nomenclature and the periodicity of the survey play a decisive role.
With regard to the selection of sample fields, however, it was shown in the first year of investigation in 1990 that very small fields can hardly be made visible in the satellite image due to the relatively low geometric resolution of the currently available image material (landsat TM: 30 to 30 m).
For the calculations, six of the seven spectral channels of the LANDSAT recordings of July 1990 and April and July 1991 were initially used; the thermal channel was excluded because it causes too many mixing pixels at the plot boundaries due to its low resolution (120 to 120 m2).
However, the intended improvement of the spectral resolution in the landsat 6 will in any case have a positive effect on the usability of smaller training fields.
Therefore, satellite images with higher resolution (SPOT, LANDSATTM 6 with 15 to 15 m2) should be available as soon as possible; at the same time, it would be necessary to check whether the inclusion of additional statistical and / or meteorological parameters in the correlation calculations can achieve sufficiently high determination dimensions and satisfactory confidence intervals of the yield estimate.
In 1987, with the support of the ITA Consortium, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry began to use satellite data with high geometric and spectral resolution to carry out estimates of land and crop yields supplemented by sampling data from land use surveys on 4,500 land segments of 50 and 100 hectares.
A first attempt to combine this survey with satellite data took place in 1981 with a picture of landsat MSS, but did not yield convincing results, which was attributed to the insufficient resolution of the sensor MSS.
It has also emerged that the regression estimate can be used for both ground data and segments, provided that one has a satellite with sufficient resolution, where SPOT appears to be more suitable for this field of application than landsat TM.
A finer spatial resolution is necessary in order to be able to study the effects on the environment.
Different applications in different geographical areas require different resolution and accuracy when estimating geophysical parameters.
For example, geostationary satellites can capture an area of one-fifth of the Earth's surface in thirty minutes and deliver images with a resolution of 5 or 2.5 km.
It mentions some of the problems encountered in the project, including the difficulty of obtaining consistent multi-temporal data, the problem of developing a consistent and generally accepted classification, and the limitations of the scale and resolution of other amounts of data that must be used to combine land use data.
PC with Pentium 100 MHz (minimum) - 16 MB RAM (minimum) - 4-speed CD-ROM drive (minimum) - 15 MB free disk space - screen: Super VGA, 256 colors (resolution 640-480) - Windows 95.
The quality of the post-irradiation examinations has been improved by the development of a method that can be used to produce high-resolution microradiographies from irradiated switch grains.
The resolution of REM is about 20 nm, the upper limit here is at least 1000 micrometers.
The main obstacle to the classic image remote is the bandwidth: With the conventional switched telephone lines, it is still difficult to transmit an image of good resolution with sufficiently high repetition frequency to really give the impression of movement.
The image sensor developed by IMEC provides a better resolution in the center of the image (according to the Fovea) than on its edge (retina), using a very limited number (8013) of pixels.
With the EISS-Browser, imagery can be found and viewed with low resolution.
Equipped with the right signal converter, any TV device purchased today can receive digital programs, just not with the high resolution.
BARON's stereoscopic projection table shows crystal clear images of high resolution computer workstations and PC graphics cards.
The resulting demand led to the development of CCD color image devices with high resolution.
However, many users use the range of lower resolution IVP products of slower devices.
Spa has high resolution, low time constant, easy compatibility with computer control and the ability to function within a wide temperature range
As a mechatronic device, the SPA-effek-tor / sensor offers some desirable characteristics such as high resolution, low time constant, easy compatibility with computer control and the ability to function within a wide temperature range and is suitable for the development of intelligent mechanisms.
The correlation spectrometers use correlation technology to improve the resolution otherwise limited by the specifically long reactor pulse.
The centrepiece of the project is "MGW," a "smart media streaming server" that allows content to be distributed to separate networks, changing the audio / video bit rate, resolution and format.
The Space Apphcations Institute, which is part of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), has published a report that outlines a new methodology for mapping Europe's forests using an advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR).
The measuring device is based on the application of a supraspectral sensor with corresponding spatial resolution, which is potentially supplemented by an infrared sensor with a lower resolution;
This will be the first time such a "snapshot" of planet Earth has been compiled in terms of resolution and capture / coverage.
The themes of the projects presented were: Ways of supporting the Altimetri for climate forecasting, monitoring of marine pollution, the use of Earth observation to assess the health of European forests, the PELCOM project, the objective of which is the creation of an "updated" map of Europe with a resolution of 1 km, assessment of the impact of UV radiation and monitoring of ozone levels.
The data should be obtained using the output of meteorological models and low resolution satellite data.
The third batch involves the management of a low resolution satellite data processing chain.
Operation of the MARS data includes data derived from a global circulation model, low resolution satellite data and derived products; mapping and delivery of the results; updating of the corresponding MARS database.
Siemens dealt with data quality, as fixed models require much higher resolution and accuracy than normal scans.
Finally, it commissioned the École Nationale Supérieure de Physique de Strasbourg (ENSPS) to develop a high-speed memory card that can store 2,000 images with the full resolution of 512 to 512 pixels.
The resolution of this vectorial equation according to the coordinate directions leads to the accelerations acting in x, y and z directions.
An excerpt from a measuring letter is reproduced in picture 43, with two times the signal frequency, once with high resolution, recorded.
One advantage of the empirical versus the teoretic identification of categories is that it is thus possible to determine their general applicability and reliability in the resolution of ambiguities in real texts.
The resolution, in turn, takes place in the source language; when translated into multiple languages at the same time, individual meanings can only be entered into these programs at certain points.
This could lead to an increase in the resolution of ultrasound testing.
For reasons of higher accuracy (greater resolution) in the simulation of the hybrid calculator and the uniform standardization of the entire road for arbitrary cut-off plans, the coefficients of the linearized rolling road model for set-value deviations were calculated and multiplied by factors for an amplitude normalization.
Full volume scanning with a high resolution radar (like the one in Chilbolton) would take too long.
Of these data, those with the low resolution (10 s) were only used to study long durations (larger than 32 s), while those with the high resolution were used to describe the process as a whole.
The shortcomings there, such as insufficient resolution and too long response times, are currently a major obstacle to the inclusion of certain innovation-relevant information in databases.
The research project of the IRSID (47) uses a new generation of X-ray radiation detectors with a photodiode line, which allows the simultaneous recording of a large number of measurement points with the same accuracy but with a finer resolution than with existing measuring devices.
However, the use of the new resolution has the advantage that it is now possible to detect the differences in surface temperature over the length of the absorbers flowing through.
The dissolution of this model of price flexibility is achieved by balancing supply and demand.
The dissolution of the model leads us to set three marginal quotas.
The improvement of non-destructive methods with high spatial and temporal resolution, which characterize, for example, bioactive interfaces (structure, function, stability) and the design of miniaturized transformers for devices based on biological function.
The ability to link high and low resolution images recorded simultaneously by the same platform allows for a much more accurate analysis.
A high resolution zoom effect and the same spectral bands make it possible to better describe virtually every image point.
The radiometric resolution has been adapted to measure the differences caused by soil growth - and not just the large contrasts that meteorologists need.
Using the low resolution (1 km) footage taken by the NOAA (National Oceanography and Atmospheric Administration) American weather observation satellites, the GFS has produced a map of all tropical forests on Earth.
This inventory was only possible due to several technological developments in the field of radar wave sensors (microwave sensors) with low spatial resolution.
Their goal is to track the development of tropical forest surfaces almost simultaneously through the combined use of images with both low and high resolution.
The high resolution images then make it possible to analyse the affected region in detail and to accurately determine the size of the existing woodland.
A new type of sonar • In the field of marine technology and the ACID (Acoustic Imaging Development) project, a new generation of sonars has been developed, the peculiarity of which is that they provide images whose resolution is independent of the distance between the detector and the target object.
(Resolution by the Annual General Meeting)
By scanning documents, the contents of paper pages can be stored as a computer file containing an image of the source document with a specific resolution.
The resolution of a scanner is expressed in dots per inch (dpi).
Color scanners can now easily reach a resolution of 300 or 600 dpi.
The resolution of a fax scanner is much lower (100 to 200 dpi).
Due to the low resolution and poor print quality, the optical character recognition for faxes is often difficult to apply.
Henning T. rips two cables from the stereo system, knots it to a blade and fastens it to a hook on the ceiling.
He called on governments in the region to commit to sustainable land use and sustainable facilities that do not come at the expense of Southeast Asia's natural resources - mainly forests.
Some investors seem to be relying on safe assets such as gold.
For this, investors in Europe hold over 34 percent short-term assets on average, compared with 14 percent in the United States.
For this, short-term investments in Europe are more than twice as weighted.
Especially for small countries such as Switzerland, where the possibilities for the dispersal of assets and the selection of securities are limited due to the size of the domestic capital market, the securities system abroad is of great importance.
In recent years, the economy has benefited greatly from global demand for US assets, especially debt in the form of securities that financed a large current-account deficit.
The whole financial universe - investment and trade - has been increasingly covered for 100 years, as it has hardly been in any other financial market:
In the past, sustainable investment was mainly about filtering out plants in "poorly respected" industries such as alcohol, guns and tobacco.
Such assets, as well as shareholdings or cash reserves, form the asset side.
What about currency risk - should assets be secured?
In a broad comparison, we therefore expect the risk-yield ratio of investments in the emerging markets to improve in the future.
The plant's guru, Jim Rogers, once said that at a plant in the Emerging Markets, it would be best to buy what emerging markets themselves buy, namely raw materials.
A new era of sustainable plants
Initial approaches only excluded plants in "scapegoating sectors," such as alcohol, guns, or tobacco.
We at Credit Suisse define sustainable investment as the explicit recognition that environmental, social and governance factors can influence the ability of companies to generate long-term returns.
Our research methodology for sustainable investments starts with an analysis of the sustainability opportunities and risks that can fundamentally affect a company's ability to secure its profitability.
Why do sustainable plants and sustainably run companies find so much more public attention today than they did 10 years ago?
Because of disasters like Fukushima or Deepwater Horizon, investors are asking how their plants affect the environment and society.
Awareness of sustainable assets has also grown in importance as a result of the market turbulence of recent times.
Do you expect the trend towards sustainable investments to be limited to purely niche areas such as environmental technology, or will the consideration of ESG criteria be established as a lasting trend among investors around the world?
We want to offer investors our know-how in the field of sustainable investments, play a visible and important role in this and, at the same time, participate in the steady growth in this area.
In investment and banking products, in the consulting process, in the instruments we offer and - most importantly - in our employees, "adds Pauli.
"Returns are important, no question," explains Pauli, "but good advice, including a clear rationale that speaks for or against a plant, is just as significant."
"Investing has become a very complex matter," explains Nicole Pauli, "and from a certain point, product specialists are required to have specific, detailed knowledge of a plant."
For example, asset management specialists for asset investments in funds and alternative investments, or investment bankers for strategic choices such as an IPO or merger and, finally, private banking advisers for private asset management.
For example, Value Investing goes to Benjamin Graham and David Dodd and their 1934 plant standard work "Security Analysis" (German:
Speaking to John Maynard Keynes, supporters of the Contrarian strategy take the following view: "A fundamental principle of investing is to oppose the prevailing view, because if everyone agrees on the merits of a plant, it is bound to be too expensive and therefore unattractive."
On the one hand, the in turn increased risk aversion would speak for a flight to safe assets, given the debt problems in Greece and Spain.
On the other hand, from the point of view of a foreign investor, a plant in Franconia would represent a diversification in the portfolio.
Moreover, inflows into indexed products are entering a relatively illiquid market, forcing investors from passively managed mandates in assets at a yield level that we believe is unsustainable.
The true dimension was evident in the publication of the Bank's results for the third quarter of 2011: The new Basel III rules would have increased risk weighed assets or RWA in investment banking to more than double, largely due to fixed income investments.
The lack of investment alternatives and the world's high liquidity in investors "depots also speak to an investment in equities.
You make a decision (buy a plant) and hope for a positive effect (want to get a return).
It is a measure of the yield volatility of a plant around its mean value.
Instruments at very low risk, such as most money market assets, receive one, very high-risk assets such as options, on the other hand, a five.
This is particularly important given the current very unusual market environment for fixed income assets, which is characterised by exceptionally low returns and a poor supply of safe assets.
For investors who want to share in the potential of equity markets but are unwilling to bear all the associated risks, an investment in convertible bonds is available.
Many of the company's founders are also looking for ways to convert some of their assets tied into the company into liquid assets and diversify them into unsecured and uncorrelated assets.
Long-term investment in the oil, mining, manufacturing and transportation sectors is more stable than the investments in stocks and bonds currently withdrawn from other emerging markets.
Responsible plants offer new opportunities
For example, the first comprehensive investment report from seven regions around the world of the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance (GSIA) in 2013 found that at least USD 13.6 trillion of professionally managed assets now apply so-called ESG criteria (environmental, social and governance considerations, environmental, social and governance criteria) to the selection and management of their assets when selecting and managing their assets.
This represents around 22 percent of the assets under management from these regions and proves that sustainable facilities have reached a critical mass in the surveyed regions as a whole.
The final panel discussion focused on the central theme of "Impact Investing," that is, investments that, in addition to their financial return, also lead to social and / or environmental improvements thanks to sustainable business growth.
Pointing to the collapse of the Rana factory building in Bangladesh in April 2013, which caused over 1100 deaths and around 1000 serious injuries among the sewers employed there, Oliver Niedermaier explained that long-term investors such as sovereign wealth funds, ultra high net Worth Individuals and employee benefits institutions consider these types of facilities to be particularly attractive:
Responsible Investment (RI) is an investment approach that takes environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations into account when choosing and managing assets.
We have been able to raise funds quickly, especially for alternative plants, and now need to industrialise all processes - from marketing to distribution.
Speaking of growth in alternative plants, what is the reason for this demand?
In my opinion, the AM, with its first-class products in the field of alternative and traditional equipment, as well as its strong multi-asset class solutions business, meets these requirements.
How do you ensure a sound investment and risk management process?
What does this mean in relation to installations?
The new, hand-picked investment themes and ideas from Credit Suisse's Investment Strategy & Research team have been developed to help you get the most out of your plant in the second half of 2014.
Giles Keating, Head of Research, explains the reasoning behind the ideas and the impact of the plant.
"For example, European customers like to delegate their assets and often opt for asset management mandates.
The third factor could play a role, although we do not have explicit government guidance regarding facilities.
Life insurance companies such as pension funds, which have traditionally built heavily on fixed-income assets, face problems.
Given their risk profile, and also because of the Investment Guidelines (BVG), it will be difficult for these investors to increase their share of riskier assets such as equities or high-interest bonds.
This debt reduction means that market participants liquidate their emerging markets assets.
Exchanges are now owned by shareholders who expect an appropriate return on capital for their plant.
The boom in 2001 was triggered by too-low housing supply, significant job growth, expansionist monetary policy, and the trend by households to shift their assets from shares to residential real estate.
In addition to the classic direct investment, there are a whole range of alternatives that avoid the potential disadvantages of such a facility, such as low liquidity and lack of transparency.
Put simply, I decide whether we invest more in bonds, equities, cash or alternative assets, as well as the allocation of various sub-asset categories such as loans, hedge funds or private equity, such as regions, countries and styles, such as value Stocks or Growth Stocks.
He gives today a number of ways to cover the megatrends "Demographic developments," "multipolar world" and "sustainability" with a single plant.
That would then be the right environment to deal intensively with plants that take these megatrends into account.
In fact, the plant has made high returns to countries with weaker economic growth in the past.
The primary investment issue for an investment in India is consumption, that is, an investment in non-cyclical consumer goods, personal care products, electronic products, high-demand goods such as cars and mobile phones or luxury goods.
For each profile it is established in which bandwidths the bonds, the shares, the alternative investments and the currencies may move.
The American data provides an approximate idea of the potential returns of plants to agricultural land.
Plants in farmland would have been a good admixture for most depots over the last two decades.
Only the right harvest year makes a fine wine a good plant.
The report also provides valuable data material for the important top-down analysis of assets, and assigns current concerns in the market regarding public debt in the right context: It proves that the estimated $42 trillion in global public debt in 2009 is equivalent to just one-fifth of the $195 trillion of households "global wealth," explained Giles Keating.
At the same time, they open up interesting opportunities for investments in companies that benefit from this development.
The Danish entrepreneur and venture capitalist, Morten Lund, learned this on his own, when a position of his portfolio of over 80 assets - the most famous of which was the internet telephony and video software Skype - became worthless in 2009, bringing him around all of his assets.
The development of exclusive offerings has led to new structured products, tailor-made facilities and new investment funds, such as a $750-million loan fund.
We can support customers in all areas - from pure asset formation to the stage when they need complex solutions to investment and investment issues. "
"In the last few years, our biggest competition has been passive plants," explains Küffer.
He was involved in two companies and had made some of his investments into money through an IPO of both companies.
"It has already occurred that we advised an internationally active listed company on mergers and capital markets while offering personal investment or financial advice to the family holding company," says Fleuriot.
In general, therefore, it is fair to say that - with the right advice and care - hedge fund assets are not necessarily more risky than traditional assets.
Alternative investments therefore remain an important part of any capital allocation.
Unlike in the 1990 "s, the minimum interest rate can no longer be achieved with a near-risk facility such as Swiss federal bonds.
However, the attachment of the coupons and repayment amounts of the bonds to higher interest rates compensates for the loss of market value in the long term.
However, at a time of negative real interest rates, it cannot be considered an adequate facility for the medium and long term, as the investor has to accept a real loss of wealth.
By expanding the range of products and services in the fields of philanthropy, microfinance, sustainable investments and the so-called "Impact Investing," Swiss banks could therefore open up interesting new areas of business.
However, against the background of the latent and hard-to-predict structural inflationary pressures, we are already increasingly relying on real assets.
Real assets are a cornerstone of our investment strategy.
The economic progress, the generous liquidity provision of central banks, the continued favourable or appropriate valuation of risky assets and the still existing investment pressure should leave the financial market pendulum further in the direction of opportunities.
In the case of alternative plants, it is also important once again to put together the right mix of these heterogeneous plants.
In contrast to the euro or the dollar, high-risk investments in Swiss francs still yield a positive return.
Should the states be offered a menu with just one dish or a meal à la carte?
I personally believe that the invention of the à la carte meal was a great step forward for civilisation compared to the menu with only one dish that matched the barracks' eating habits.
'We're merely pointing out how meals that make fat can be replaced with low-calorie yet tasty dishes. '
In addition, some dishes are complete meals, while others are made entirely of vegetables.
The protein / energy ratio recommended for dishes prepared only with meat (7 g per 100 kcal) is above the value of a directed beef half (5 g per 100 kcal), but is substantially lower than that for chicken, poultry and fish (15 g per 100 kcal).
Fruit juices (with or without sugar), nectar (diluted fruit juice, usually with added sugar) and dishes consisting exclusively of fruit have long been part of the diet of the infant to be breastfed throughout Europe.
The committee's recommendations allow for a slight increase in natural carbohydrate content (up to a total value of 15 g per 100ml in fruits and nectar and up to 20 g per 100g in a dish consisting only of fruit) to allow it to match the taste.
Changes in dietary habits were also caused by the explosive development of travel, mobility, the emergence of restaurants, among others, which offer foreign dishes, as well as the increasing popularity of foreign food.
Paella The dish comes from the Spanish rice-growing area on the Mediterranean coast, the region of Valencia.
A few days later, when he was given the same dish again, he used his detector to detect ionizing radiation at that time something completely new and hugely influencing, and found that the food was radioactive.
He gave a little of a radioactive substance to the food remains on his plate, and when the same dish was put back to him, he used his radiation detector and found the food was radioactive.
There are also gluten-free alternatives and dishes for allergy sufferers. "
Consequently, there is a great need for ready meals, which has led to the development of new food products and packaging, such as TV dinners and pre-cooked dishes that are consumed or only need to be heated in the microwave.
Examples of products in which these materials are already used are stock-based dishes, snacks such as potato chips and peanuts, and also the ultralight "brick-shaped" vacuum packaging for coffee.
Within a generation, our food has become more varied and varied - we eat food and dishes from all over Europe and around the world.
In each school, the most successful dishes were awarded, and these recipes were published in the magazine "Ha Kuriren."
She learned how to prepare Italian dishes and, in particular, desserts with fresh ingredients from the surrounding area.
However, if you like to travel this way, you have to find these wonderful places first, be sure to get a good reception there and taste authentic regional dishes.
Guests enjoyed traditional Finnish dishes based on reindeer, salmon and caviar, and Finnish beers were also served.
The event, organised under the auspices of the President and the Secretary-General of the EESC and organised in collaboration with Hervé Coupeau (Group III - Various Interests), representatives of the young farmers of France and the overseas French departments in the Committee, presented typical products and culinary specialities from Martinique, Guadeloupe, Réunion, Guiana and Corsica and served traditional dishes and beverages.
If you add a little flexibility and freedom so that a group can exchange dishes with each other, you may even achieve an even higher level of satisfaction.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in several places in their volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Crowd: Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I also worked at the school in the open full day.
What are your experiences with that?
Crowd: It's a beautiful, broad spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
They are now 26 years, so a late-career volunteer.
How does that happen?
Crowd: I graduated.
And then a civil engineering degree, let's say, successfully canceled.
I've realised for myself that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something different, work with people.
And then I wondered, what are you doing.
Make a social year, there's an insight, because you can see what it's like on the ground, in the focal point maybe, really.
And was it?
Crowd: I collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in social engineering in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably do a social work education in the Youth Welfare Office of Herne and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Is it not a little unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service?
Crowd: Yes, it's very variable.
It probably always comes down to where you do your FSJ.
You can do it from retirement home to youth work - in all sorts of facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also in the OGS in part, so in afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly the right thing that irritated me.
I was able to see my own strengths and see how it really works out.
Unlike in civil engineering studies?
Crowd: Well, this is not about counting stats.
You always have other people in front of you who each have a very different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, whether a young person who has been taken out of the family - you always have to go into it individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no sense of touch?
Crowd: I'm not the guy for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are negative moments, too, but that's just the way life is.
Merely the planning of the invasion of Iraq, in which Rumsfeld advocated the use of fewer troops than proposed, suggests an inadequate understanding of distributed systems.
Those who wanted to limit the use of juries apparently feared a risk to state security in some cases.
Nearly three billion sank the budget for various compensation for victims of communism and crime, or for expenses for the court disputes, even for building savings.
Local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials carried unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
The two first victims were hospitalised with serious injuries, where the eighteen-year-old died.
The lawyer for Samantha Geimer, the victim, also once again demanded that the criminal case be overturned.
As far as we know, Werner Söllner is not only a perpetrator, but also a victim.
The troops are outnumbered with praise for their victims.
Mario Monti, a future Italian leader, has called for a little more time from the markets to form his stall and implement a program that calls for "sacrifice" to regain the credit rating lost during the final months of the Berlusconi government.
If France took the decision to opt out of nuclear power, a large proportion of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and the annual EUR 6 billion in capital goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more.
For my group, it is particularly positive to see that the development initiated by the rejection of the budget by this House has now been ushered in an incipient resolution of the problems.
But time and again, forces are emerging that lead to a dissolution in the shield, although EuroPilot, the organisation of European pilots, also states that Eurocontrol is the solution to European air traffic control.
The resolution of the Committee on Transport draws attention to the urgent case of Eurocontrol and calls for its resolution to be avoided, or at least for its specific, albeit limited, function to be maintained.
How did the Commission assess the recent dissolution of the political parties in Turkey by the military junta?
Europe is changing under our eyes, but, and this should be emphasised, with the result of a dissolution and destruction not only of space, but also of family, culture and society: This is the Europe of the equal, not the Europe of the peoples.
I believe it is essential to prevent further proliferation of nuclear weapons as a result of the dissolution of the former Soviet Union.
The question, however, is whether the separation, the dissolution will end the disputes, or whether they will continue in the face of the new geopolitical links that are now emerging, which are unlikely to allow a peaceful life in the Balkans.
The dangers of the proliferation of technology and technical know-how for the production of (nuclear, chemical, biological) weapons of mass destruction increased significantly after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
Their desperation is the result of the dissolution of Yugoslavia and the failure of the leaders responsible to agree on how the peoples of the former Yugoslavia should live together.
It is also otherwise sneaky when it says that, in line with the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, other institutions could be dissolved.
You are basically asking the Community the question: Deepening to the state or dissolution to a free trade area?
Unfortunately, however, the developments so far, following the collapse of the socialist camp and the dissolution of the USSR, the statements by the representatives of NATO and America, the blatant attacks or interventions against independent states, prove the importance of the character and objectives of any conversion of the arms industry and conversion of military sites.
But this is no wonder: No country on earth, not even the richest and best-developed Western country, could have stood up to the sudden 85 percent drop in its own trade, as happened in Cuba through the dissolution of the COMECON.
His dissolution of parliament, the dismissal of the judges and the provisional repeal of the constitution, his imprisonment of a large number of people and, of course, his ban on the free press - much of it is not only questionable when it comes to a democracy, but directly unlawful.
(B3 - 002 / 94 - 0 - 278 / 93) by Mr Moran López and others to the Commission on the dissolution of the Gibraltar Social Insurance Fund.
There is no question that the dissolution of a number of African states, including Somalia, Liberia and Burundi, which Hen Pons Grau mentions in his report, together with the social and economic destabilisation that eventually led to civil wars, played a crucial role in the rise in the number of refugees.
Firstly, because we must not confuse the 'integration' of the Member States into the Community or the Union with their 'dissolution' in the same way.
Perhaps things could have taken a different course from the outset, from the hasty break-up of Yugoslavia; many sides, including the European Community, are partly responsible for the current situation - divisions, war, ethnic cleansing, national homogenisation, intolerance, territorial conquests, apparent incompatibility, acts of violence, cruelty, enmity that will continue for a long time.
Following the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, these countries are looking for a path to democracy and a social market economy.
In the wake of the political events following this signing, in particular the dissolution of the Kazakh Parliament by President Nazarbaiev, our Parliament was forced to suspend the ratification procedure for this agreement pending the holding of parliamentary elections.
There are disturbing reports of experiments carried out on people in Ukraine after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
It is not possible to strengthen Europe through its dissolution.
This includes an immediate dissolution of the military and civil repression apparatus, the prosecution of the paramilitaries, an end to impunity and compensation for the victims.
The Commission endorses the conclusions of the Vienna Summit, which provide for the disarmament and dissolution of these militias and the deployment of a United Nations mission to reduce tensions.
One thing I would like to highlight in this debate is that today we are witnessing the dissolution and destruction of Kosovo and an entire people.
The recent municipal and regional elections have been declared invalid and the military has taken over legislative and executive power following the dissolution of the National Assembly.
The standard of living of its population has fallen steadily, the insecurity and influence of various mafias has increased alarmingly, and the state is on the road to dissolution.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, it rearranged its relations with the parliaments of the new countries and formed four separate delegations: With Russia, with Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, with the three Transcaucasian republics and with the Central Asian republics (including Mongolia).
The net value of the ECSC assets was allocated to research in the sectors relating to the coal and steel industries, in accordance with the protocol annexed to the EC Treaty following the dissolution of the ECSC.

The maintenance and consolidation of parliamentary democracy was therefore always the fundamental theme of the work of the EZPWD in the 1980s, which grew in importance after the break-up of the communist regimes and the dissolution of the Eastern bloc in 1989 (meeting of correspondents in London, 1989).

Dissolution; termination of a company that precedes or follows the liquidation of the company, i.e. the divestiture of the company's assets, the satisfaction of the creditors and the distribution of the remaining assets among the shareholders.
The object of this analysis is the transfer of the "seat" of a union without resolution, as stated in the task.
The addition "without resolution" makes it clear that these are the rules of private international law which determine which law is relevant to a society and whether a society is to be regarded as a legally established legal person.
The present investigation is limited to the question of whether the rules of the Member States in the field of company law and private international law should be aligned in such a way as to allow companies to transfer their actual seat to another Member State without dissolution.
(1) the law applicable to a company; (2) the amendment of the law applicable to a company; (3) the possibility to transfer the administrative seat of a company without dissolution from the founding state; (4) the possibility to transfer the administrative seat to another Member State while maintaining the legal personality of the company.
This requires the dissolution of the society in the country of departure and the re-establishment in the host state.
However, in all the Member States which apply the seat theory, the case law does not allow a company to transfer its administrative seat without dissolution to another
In some Member States, this would lead to the dissolution of society in:
In all Member States, a company may transfer the administrative seat within the jurisdiction of the State concerned without dissolution.
(1) Companies should be able to transfer their administrative seat, i.e. their actual seat, to another Member State without dissolution.
(2) Companies are entitled, on the basis of the freedom of establishment, to transfer their actual seat without dissolution (subject to the rules applicable in the Member States on the grounds of traffic protection).
This is a step backwards for those Member States which apply the seat theory and allow the transfer of seats without resolution.
The Member State can only delete these register entries on the basis of proof of the dissolution of the company in accordance with the legislation of a Member State which is applicable to the company.

Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 per cent as another restructuring programme is launched to overcome the pressures facing the company.
The job cuts, announced by director general John Fallon mostly for late 2018 and early 2019, comes on top of its previous restructure, which has already lost 4,000 jobs.
In May, Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by a further £300 million (US $394 million) in a third cost-cutting program to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it posted a 1 per cent increase to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and wounding several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a statement from NATO said.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest violence to hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed at a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A statement from NATO says Thursday night's explosion happened when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "person-worn improvised explosive device."
The statement says all of the injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. Military Hospital at the Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% were in the capital.
In late July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out that attack.
On May 31, a huge bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's deadliest militant attack since US-led forces pushed the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as U.S. President Donald Trump weighs in on increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government, its policies and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has lifted a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration, requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency over the stride.
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to push ahead with so-called "ozone regulations in 2015," saying it showed the agency's commitment to work with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners," EPA Chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA's intention to delay ozone regulations - in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in part of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet stricter air quality standards - by a year until October 2018.
A group of 15 largely Democratic states, along with the District of Colombia, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, saying the effort was illegal.

However, the efforts have prompted the setback of Democrats and conservation groups worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPA's website says inhaling air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms," such as asthma.
The rules are not yet definitive, but formal adoption in the European Parliament and the European Council is scheduled for this spring.

Before the discussion, there is an important piece of information: The purchase contract for the missing part of the land has been signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will be a long time before the area so far belonging to the church community is in community ownership, there is now no planning impediment to the project to be stamped by a private investor.
There is a discussion about a common area for this.
One of the two investors still on the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, it would provide a living space - about 55 square feet - and an adjoining terrace with at least 70 square feet of space for a special price.
It is up to the administration and the majority of the local council not to provide such a common space as a meeting place only for the residents of seniority housing, but openly into the community.
As an example, the word from the "knitting café" made the rounds.
The decision, which was pre-decided by the provision of funds for the current budget as early as last autumn, will be sweetened by funding opportunities.

It sees it as a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.

Mr Staiger's request to split the proposal for a decision accordingly is supported by three advocates.

Let's give them that. '
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight." "
Climate asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy Lomachenko must fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also has an interest in battling the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight at the Forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans asked about him," Garcia said, later openly opting to fight with the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other names can generate that kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready... "
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter," and he may be taking part in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia, saying that he thinks the three-match champion from Riverside looks "very slow, sorry Mikey... you want the co-off."
Garcia said the focus was to show concussion, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum building up for their own fight.
'This is the fight that needs to be carried out.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it, "Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It's going to be a great fight. '
Four injured after tyre burst
Four people were seriously injured in an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle about 4.30pm just before the market-wide junction, presumably after a tyre burst.
The car veered to the right into the embankment, where it was overshadowed and then left on the roof in the green strip.
The four passengers - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident.
During the emergency service's initial care of the injured, the A7 was closed towards the north for about an hour, followed by traffic on the left-hand side of the road at the accident site.
This is good advice on land as well, but it is all the more important underwater because of the poor lighting conditions.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Threesome works better"
After 2-2 to start the season against Braunschweig, Andre Hoffmann hopes that optimising the defensive formation in Aue will score points.
With the first game of the season Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result also, had there not been the two opponents at 2-2 against Braunschweig.
"That was two tackles too much, and we have to be even better in Aue," says Fortuna Duesseldorf's defender.
In the Ore Mountains, the three-chain is to be further optimised.
And a goal after a free-kick, the Fortunes don't want to capture either.
"For the future, it will be that no one is putting themselves on the line next to Michael (Rensing)." "
Hoffmann is convinced that even after the experience in preparation, his team will cope better with the three-pointer than with the quadriceps.
"Still I don't know how we're going to operate in Aue," says his coach, Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause "because we've just got players in the three-way line at the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build well," Hoffmann said.
"The prerequisite, however, is that we harmonise even better and we don't make as many playoff errors in the build-up."
Of course, Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game.
"But whether you can talk about a failed start after an indecision, you don't know.
The performance might well be okay, "Hoffmann said.
"But if we can get by four points on Sunday and focus on the cup, we'll certainly be able to talk about a decent start to the season." "
His coach didn't want to know about that.
"I don't judge the start of the season until after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to talk about an advantage over Aue just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be canceled early because of a storm.
"Now they can virtually start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann believes the players from Aue might even be a little fresher as they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an upstart favourite in the bone.
"But they don't know as 100% where they currently stand," says Fortuna's interior defender.
Although the guests from the Rhineland will go to the meeting at the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue as a slight favourite on Sunday.
"The fact that we are feasting them away just because we are entitled to get under the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose record in just one defeat to Aue from nine games is quite positive.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start," explains Fortune's head coach.
'to make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant. '
And so Funkel doesn't want to experience his players on Sunday.

Bray led that the "outraged" response to the eviction of their tent camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to court, where the judge, Lucy Billings, issued an injunction banning the violent eviction of the place and allowing the protesters to camp.

New results of Swedish asylum-age assessment tests published
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 per cent of those tested are over the age of 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests last year.
They are expected to make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum process after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) were judged to be 18 or older, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged the person was "possibly 18 years or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under the age of 18."
The tests are only carried out in cases where the person's age is called into question.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been steady in recent months.
"We don't see a big difference in the statistics over the past few months, the numbers are pretty steady," he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to be over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases that "suggest the person under investigation was 18 years or older."
When the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of those cases, the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which makes X-ray images of wisdom teeth and MRI shots of knee joints, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.

However, Mr Göransson, of the Forensic Medicine Agency, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in which case that's about 10 per cent. '

Full in plan
Work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-tonne concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good in time, it's going super," says Reinhold Leicht, a construction manager at the Department of Road and Transport at the Freiburg governor's office.
In April, work began at the same time on all three remedial bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
Construction is scheduled for October and Leicht is certain the timetable will be met.
The first bridge, from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a vaulted bow bridge made of concrete, which is covered with red buntsandstone and has a total length of 4.80 metres.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings will now be thoroughly restored.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red Buntsandstein.
Both were built in 1939 and are 12, or 10.60 metres long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 metre wide and seven tonne so-called bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning.
This is a fringe attachment that is also used as an operating path.
A 2.20-metre-wide bridge cap will be used on the southern part of the bridge on Friday.
This is where the pedestrian path is supposed to go.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent from the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps.
The laying of lines by the building in Lauterbach has required particular sensitivity.
This is because there is also a fibre-optic cable to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed by hand papers about the project in the lead-up to the work.
In addition, fish and crayfish had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the yard building and the saddle weiler in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated single-lane by a traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is completely closed.
The combined cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000.
The whole thing is funded by the country.
In recognition of the increasingly complex task facing the United Nations in its efforts to prevent and resolve conflicts and to secure and consolidate peace, I asked an expert group led by the former Foreign Minister of Algeria, Lakhdar Brahimi, to present a report that gives an overview of the peace operations and makes suggestions on how they could be strengthened in the future.
I trust that the international community will swiftly support Lebanon in the task of rebuilding the economy in the south and restoring its link with the rest of the country.
That force has been assigned the task of providing safe supply bases for the operations of up to 500 military observers to oversee the implementation of the Lusaka cease-fire agreement.
AFD in Gerolstein: Bout protest at German potato salad
It is not so common for parties to pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to reconcile.
The parties represented in the Vulkaneifel district (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, left) are part of a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag on this day because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle invites Rondell to the "big campaign launch," according to the poster.
And well-known names to launch - such as Alice Weidel, who along with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the federal election on September 24, and Deputy Federal President Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are on the ground hours before the event starts don't want to listen to the AfD people, but demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colourful."
The city picnic was originally planned under the slogan "All at a table" on the fountain square, but now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the town hall.
A colourful picture that offers itself there.
And what Christa Karoli, president of the Forum One World and one of the key organizers, is really looking forward to: "Great how many people have come together here."
There is music and lots of food, including an "ancient German potato salad that the AfD could also eat easily," says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officers to Gerolstein, and it shows presence especially at the station, which is just a few metres from the venues.
How did the AfD actually get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he has sought such an event and has been awarded the contract.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf first asked in Daun, but got a cancellation there because there were not enough parking spaces because of the Laurentiuskirmes already built.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a beautiful event here."
Referring to the event on the Rondel precinct, he says: "This is the good right of the people, the main thing is that it remains peaceful."
It also does: At 8pm, there is a band for entertainment on the Rondellvorplatz, and various speakers in the town hall, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
There are about 200 listeners in the room waiting for the front-runner for the federal election, Alice Weidel, and Deputy Federal President Beatrix von Storch to deliver their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far officials have had a quiet evening.
The AfD event takes just over an hour, and guests on the precinct have a longer breath, but there is also a need to clean up there just after 9pm.
The police can move away - no special incidents.
The key to success is to stretch our heads into the sky, but to stay firmly on the ground with our feet.

However, if the tenants do not agree on the new rent, it will be set by an independent court.
But Mr. Hayes's lawyers have already filed motions in court setting out grounds for an appeal and which the courts will deal with for years to come.
But some lawyers said appellation courts were often confronted with the argument that social and technical changes would require adaptation by the courts.
Early next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to justice.
If the court were to charge her, she would refuse to go, she said.

Trombone meets trumpet
There will be a rehearing with the Wolff trombonist Frederic Belli in the series Haslacher Klosterkonzerte tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest," or even "Balkan folklore" meets a classical German education with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
For example, Petkov is a soloist at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is the Soloposaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both unites the desire not only to cross the boundaries on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
That's how Johann Sebastian Bach sounds at the two as in a new guise, Daniel Schnyder's "world music" reunites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the play "Exchange Suite" by the jazz echophile Nils Wogram, classical, jazz and free play blend into a fascinating overall work of art.
This centrepiece of the program was first premiered in Freiburg this spring with huge success.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it specifically for the two musicians and more than that: The Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.

Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
'Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything, "Kristen Stewart said quite frankly about her bisexuality.
"Once I bite in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh that was cool, what's next?'"
Arguably the Hollywood star's most famous relationship was the one to her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who ultimately fell apart bitterly.
Despite all this, the brunette performer assures the Harper's Bazaar magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I was dating.
Or do you think I'd played it? '
After her split, Kristen admitted she was bisexual: "I've always lived the dualism and seriously believed in it.
So it has never confused or hindered me.
I just never liked not being taken seriously. '
However, according to "Bang Showbiz," she particularly suffered in school time when she preferred to dress like a cub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was 11 the children told me I would look like a cub.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think, 'girl, be proud of you!' "
She doesn't like to explain her love life to the public in particular: "People expect you to relate in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some describe me as undeterred, but I don't like having to justify myself in front of the whole public. '
West Virginia governor announces he's changing the party
. The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, Democrats have moved away from me, "Governor Justice said.
"Today I will tell you with lots of prayers and a lot of thought... today I will tell you, as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a Democratic governor."
The rally erupted in cheers.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time to play another game." "
Mr. Trump promised a major announcement at the West Virginia rally before.

Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.

It's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, on Thursday night, the Republican National Committee issued a statement saying, "Governor Justice's party change is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us rather than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governors and the control of the least legislative entities in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the final rejection of a party that is without leadership from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," Ronna McDaniel, the RNC chairman, told CBS News in a statement.

CoE praises' honest 'Russian apology for doping scandal
The world's head of athletics, Sebastian Coe, on Thursday praised what he described as an apparent apology from Russia to a doping scandal, but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be re-admitted to the sport.
Russia's athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country's exile from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who have been snatched away gold and silver medals in competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to uphold the ban, which was imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the federation is redesigned."
CoE said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the task force's recommendations that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia," Coe said.
"We need to do everything we can in the coming months to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the spoiled system, 'he added

Mourning act for soldiers who crashed in Mali
A ceremony in the northern hemisphere of Fritzlar has commemorated around 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place in the cathedral city on Thursday under high security precautions.
On the still unexplained cause of the crash, Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
But she described the two fallen pilots as "kings of their specialist."
"We are linking ourselves to this highest sacrifice they have provided on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and 47-year-old Stabshauptmann, from northern Hesse, were killed in west African Mali a week ago on Wednesday.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and taken to the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter on Thursday accompanied by a German army death guard.
At midday, at first, only the loved ones in the church took leave.
After that, the ceremony began in the circle of the family, closest friends, representatives of the German army as well as politics.
Among them were Hesse's prime minister, Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the general inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Mourners laid roses, and the relatives stood arm in arm at the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers watched the ceremony on a canvas.
Defence Minister von der Leyen described the fallen soldiers as "highly decorated" and fed up.
The Stabshauptmann built the flight operations of the Tiger combat helicopter in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of its regiments.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also stated: "If this crew could not avert the crash, then none would have been able to."
Minister von der Leyen did not show any doubts about the UN mission in Mali: The deployment was dangerous.
But it is also of high importance "for a country from which we are separated only by two states," she said.
After the ceremony, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
The German army did not specify when and where they will be buried.
According to Credit Suisse's Fair Value model, the Swiss franc to the euro remains undervalued, even though it has appreciated from a franc-euro rate of over 1.60 to around 1.50 since 2007.
Developed-country stock markets are valued at a rate-to-earnings ratio (KGV) of 17 versus a KGV of 10 for emerging stock markets.
Value investors focus on the "rate" in the price-to-earnings ratio, while Growth investors are more interested in the "gain" element of that figure.
As a result, Contrarian investors choose firms that are undervalued and have negative rate momentum.
Finally, the euro-franc rate is still an issue:
The stronger and more often, for example, the price of a share oscillates, the greater the fluctuation width and the more risky the capital investment.
"The Swiss National Bank's decision to set the rate at 1.20 was crucial for the growth to revive quickly," Melli recalls.
If you look at the price of gold over a longer time series, you have to say that the yellow metal is not exactly cheap at its current rate.
Corporate profits and earnings momentum are recovering from a deep level, and valuations such as the price-to-earnings ratio are also starting to increase in anticipation of rising profits.
In 2010, Geithner still attracted the attention of the media and Chinese authorities when he complained to the WEF about the price of the yuan.
If a rapid appreciation of the Chinese currency is potentially dangerous to the global economy, why is the White House so fixated on the price of the yuan?
"Even though the price-to-earnings ratio is currently in the range of values recorded in 2007, we do not expect a significant correction at the moment.
Macro-economic aspects and corporate profits will not be among the main driving factors, which is why we also expect an expansion of the price-to-earnings ratio in 2013.
Shirakawa forecasts inflation of only 0.6 percent for 2014, which is well below the BOJ's 2 percent target and could lead to the central bank having to weaken the yen rate even further to meet its inflation target.
The highest returns appear to be achieved when dividend yields are high and the price-to-earnings ratio (KGV) is low.
Higher return on equity, higher rate book value ratio and higher pay-out ratio, "said Stefano Natella, head of global equity research in Credit Suisse's Investment Banking division.
It results in higher rate book value ratios.
The PEG ratios (price-to-profit ratio divided by profit growth) of most large and almost all medium-sized enterprises are still fairly favourable compared to other emerging markets.
As a result of the strengthening of the franc, the price of the dollar fell from approximately 4.30 francs to just over 2 francs in just a few years.
In addition, valuations of future rate-profit ratios appear attractive as most companies' shares are listed at the lower end of their historical price range.
Finally, the costs for local companies are rising less than those for their competitors abroad, while the exchange relationship with the euro remains constant at a rate of around 1.20 francs.
The basic idea behind convertible bonds is that they are converted into shares when the company's price falls below a certain value.
When the franc-euro rate was 1.60, that set off much bigger margins than now, where the rate is 1.22.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all assets from its portfolio where money is used for betting on food prices," Mr Bode said.
So just 11 percent think it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer facilities that bet on food prices.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learn that their bank is involved in such transactions: One in two would terminate all plants where money goes into commodity speculation, according to the survey.
After all, and that probably says the most, our survey of business leaders found that a clear majority would like Britain to take a course towards changing the deal, and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.

Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will mark the 58th national day for the victims of workplace accidents in all the provinces of Italy, in order to draw the attention of social institutions and the media to this dramatic situation.

The Turkish community of Germany reacted calmly: It recalled the victims of racist violence at the weekend with a vigilante in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
When the victim waved, he was beaten with a knuckle on her hands and against her head.
The men then followed him, struck and then suddenly stepped on their victim and fled with his wallet and mobile phone.
"We were by no means victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
For the same reason, he refused to give Breivik, who brought a pre-recorded speech, permission to contact the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Jiménez believed that micro-credit was a "serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty," and that the governments of the developed world must now work "more than ever" according to solidarity criteria, and should not allow solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
However, he hesitantly admitted that the strange heaviness under which he was suffering could be attributed to a more natural, in a sense, more handsome cause - namely the severe and protracted illness - indeed, the apparently near dissolution - of a tearfully beloved sister - the only companion of long years - of the last and only relatives on earth.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The man of Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
The Royal House announced on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple are settled in the Cathedral Church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The queen agreed with her husband's decision, the notice said.
It is still unclear where Prince Henrik will be buried.
However, he has no intention of being settled in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title.
He would have liked to become king after thrashing his wife, Margrethe, in 1972.
He retired in 2016, also laying out the title "Prinzgemahl."
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he does not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death, explained Lene Balleby, the Danish royal's chief spokeswoman.
Where the 83-year-old's final resting place will ultimately be is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be settled in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he's worked for for the last 50 years.
The native Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French aristocracy, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked in the French Embassy on the Thames.
While his later wife always floated the people's expressions of sympathy, Prince Henrik had a serious stand in his nearly 50-year reign with the Danes.
In an autobiography, Henrik spoke about the first few years in Denmark: "A few months after I arrived, everything I did was criticised.
My Danish was swanky, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitting socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis rather than football.
Even for the Gauloises I smoked in place of Virginia tobacco and who had a reputation here for being the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I couldn't hope for leniency.
I was different.
I seemed happy with that position and not ashamed of myself.
That was just two mistakes! '

Prime Minister Weil wants swift re-election
CDU and FDP facing possible majority in Lower Saxony
Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a swift re-election of the country after losing the red-green government majority, but he does not want to resign.
Because spoke out on Friday for the dissolution of parliament.
Earlier, the surprise exit of a Green MP from her rural faction in Lower Saxony plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the state election, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
The previous Green MP, Elke Tested, justified her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she declared in Hanover on Friday.
CDU group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend that his group include them.
This would give the CDU and the FDP a combined 69 seats in the Lower Saxony country, SPD and Greens 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new day will be elected as a regular on January 14 next year.
Mr Thümler said the red-green state government must now decide whether to continue to govern in this situation without a majority.
However, Stephan Weil believes it is essential that the country decides its self-resolution as soon as possible.
The CDU group is expected to decide on its way forward on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility of the country depriving the prime minister of confidence and electing a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be examined in a legally clean way, "Thümler said.
'one will calmly discuss all the issues if they are considered legally reasonable. '
Thümler called Twestern's move "a little curious."
The politician herself insisted: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good. '
She described herself as a supporter of black and green.
The Greens called on the breakaway MPs to return their land deal.
"We assume, of course, that she will return her country's mandate, which she has received through the green national list, with immediate effect," the country's chairmen, Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner, said.
The leader of the Green Party, Anja Piel, said: "We are extremely sorry for Elke Tested's decision."
She deliberately chose not to have a debate in the group.
"Even in the light of the fact that there were no substantive differences, we cannot understand this move."
SPD chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the low-profile Green MP Elke Tvests to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the electorate but also betrayal of red-green," the federal leader of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil's (SPD) decision to quickly re-elect the country.
The exit of Twest costs red-green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician, "in her injured vanity and in her frustration, is putting her personal interests before the good of the country," criticised SPD general secretary Hubertus Heil.
'it's a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is involved in this dirty intrigue game and is trying to make political capital out of it. '
Dutch CDU group leader Björn Thümler will recommend that his MPs include Elke Tvests in the CDU.
The leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Tvests of distorting the outcome of the 2013 state election with personal career gifts.
The CDU was the strongest force before the SPD at the time, but the SPD and Greens had a skinny majority of one vote in the day.

Agriculture Minister in interview - How do we protect ourselves from toxic ponds, Mr Schmidt?
Germany discusses contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) is speaking in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print.
On the consumer protection portal www.foodcauung.de, the federal states provide the most up-to-date information on the affected eggs batches.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we know at the moment, a health hazard is virtually excluded.
Is Aldi now taking on the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of supply - because the central role of the reconnaissance is not really perceived by the federal agriculture minister?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has been delayed without delay and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany's concern.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade, like manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are marketable and harmless to health.
If the maximum residue level of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded for eggs, they are not marketable.
However, uncontaminated eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time, it is not businesses that are to blame.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, the production companies are not directly responsible.
Instead, they face economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there are too few inspectors in the event of an emergency.
Is it just a lack of staff or a lack of conclusive competence?
It was the official controls that uncovered the operation.
But the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100% excluded.
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent investigation of such events and handing over to prosecutors in cases where crimes may be available are of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear on a number of occasions that I expect full clarification from the responsible authorities.
Is regular alarmism really necessary in food scandals?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and marketable food.
When an unapproved insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The adulterated remedy has put manufacturers, distributors and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the keeping of food-supplying animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This needs to be worked on consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to ensure that the facts are swiftly and fully investigated.
How football's financial rules affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules, which aim to prevent unfettered spending by European football clubs, will not disrupt Neymar's world record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, because the senior organisation overseeing the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules, launched by UEFA in 2011, mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that Neymar's transfer was funded without major losses.
Barcelona have paid €222 million ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several $10 million a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly loosen the money for Neymar to sign and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding by Qatar's energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on acquiring players, but they have to counter with legitimate sources of income that allow them to break-Even point in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed clubs that had taken on huge debts in their quest for success were effectively cheating and risked ruining themselves if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs "debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher affair.
During the current three-year FFP disposition period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of €30 million.
And although Platini has fallen into disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, remains committed to shying away from excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly step up the rules for the future," Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG paid Neymar's buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for the accounts over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so the redemption fee for the next five years of €44.4 million can be shown in the annual accounts.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit PSG with the heaviest sanctions, along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City.
The PSG received a fine of €60 million ($82 million at the time), which was later reduced to €20 million - and it was arranged for the team members for the 2014-15 Champions League to be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is on the lookout for clubs that could try to oversee their financial supervision by inflating their revenue through companies linked to the owners of a club.
While a Catalan company could sponsor PSG if the value of the sponsorship was to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income.
That's exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA ruled that the value of the PSA's sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come via payments from the organising committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar in 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassador and such a manoeuvre could be easy for UEFA regulators to find out.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean UEFA will be even more attentive to respecting any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG over Neymar's transfer, telling people familiar with the situation on Thursday.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show PSG made a profit of more than €10 million in 2015-16 with sales of €542.4 million.
Accounts for the last fiscal year have yet to be released.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club expects sales to rise by at least 30 per cent after signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go and it tried to prevent Neymar's move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," the president of La Liga, Javier Tebas, told Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's eventual ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state funding a club.
"It's the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once a country owns a club, anything is possible.
It's going to be very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country. '
The Turkish community of Germany reacted calmly: It recalled the victims of racist violence at the weekend with a vigilante in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
The urban tender for the 16 gates opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
No doubt a gate points to the concept of a park.
Either that's the case, or someone is pretending to put goals on the land.
Collserola is more complex, "judging by the architect, for whom the title" Gates of Collserola "carries a" lexical trap ": It must not be imagined" as entrances to a park, but as a delimitation of areas on which action must be taken. "
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would conflict with that of the architect of the gate next to it.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, lamented "the success" of giving "hope" to "marginalized" people "who always face closed doors" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opens its gates, infected by the spirit of solidarity."
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
Swiss is on the lookout for a new chocolate supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has made board chocolate for the Swiss.
Now, the sweet collaboration is facing a possible end: The airline is rewriting the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report from the Northwest Switzerland newspaper on Friday, at the request of the sda news agency.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and subject to quality control.
"We are very pleased with current supplier Chocolat Frey," the spokeswoman said.
Some 17 million small rotten-packed jogging boards of 14 grams distribute the flight attendants to passengers each year before landing.
The Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.
According to "Northwest Switzerland," industry insiders estimate the volume of orders to be between 1.5 and 2 million francs - the Migros subsidiary generates annual sales of around one billion francs.
But more important, once and for all, is the advertising effect: For a chocolate maker, it's a prestigious order.
The Swiss will not reveal how many applicants there are in the new tender.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey will seek to renew the contract beyond spring 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate maker was not available for comment.
The Swiss has been distributing chocolate panels on board its flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
The opportunity to place the logo was introduced by Swiss two and a half years ago with the launch of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers are spoiled with treats from the Confiserie Sprüngli, in business class nae passengers Schoggi of Lindt and in Economy Class Schoggi by Chocolat Frey.
Also on the shoreline, Swiss Schoggi is distributed by Chocolat Frey, both in business and economy class.
Energy policy cannot, however, be judged solely from an environmental point of view, since no single power station - whatever - would soon be built and, for example, stone, clay and earth processing and all chemical industrial plants would have to be examined for the acceptance conditions of their waste among the population and - to quote Mrs Weber once again - they would probably have to wait exceedingly long, if not in vain, for acceptance.
Apart from clay and glass, metals, cardboard and plastics are now used as raw materials for their production.
This should be done in the best possible tone.
And the best tone is under the House of Commons.
I have not heard a Conservative say that we should store the waste in the best sound under the Thames.
The area is urbanised (10% of the area is cultivated); the light to heavy soil (sand, clay, clay) is most suitable for soil management (41% is farmland), forest is hardly met (8.2%).
Clay, cement, lime, plaster, asbestos products, processed natural stones, grinding stones and other abrasives, glass and ceramic products.
This also includes so-called monogermseed, which is produced by breeding, and precision seed, which is obtained by artificial division of the seed, even if it is accompanied by an overlay (mostly on the basis of clay).
Here are objects made of iron and calcareous clay (bricks) with a matt, earth-coloured fracture (generally brown, red or yellow).
Stones AND ERDEN AND building materials sand, gravel, bims, clay, slag; salt, sulfur gravel, sulphur; other stones, earths and related raw minerals; cement, lime; plaster, other processed building materials.
This also includes so-called monogermacial gut, which is obtained by breeding, and precision seed, which is obtained by artificial division of the seed (genetically single-germinated or one-germinated seed on a technical path), even if it is provided with a coating (mostly on the basis of clay).
According to PRINZ / 15 /, binary soil types always consist of a mixture of clay and canyon fractions with very different proportions of larger grain fractions.
Under the same climatic conditions, the content of organic substances in clay is higher than in the swallow or clay.
In particular clay, but also clay, are installed as natural materials in layers with mostly static compression at the landfill base.
The sealing of landfills with such clay-sand mixtures is extremely economical and easy to control.
The secondary geothermal (clay) sealing layer of variant 2 consists exclusively of earth materials.
This base layer is more likely to be produced from recondensed earth materials (usually clay) than from upcoming, insitu-condensed soils.
A number of procedures are offered by the EPO to calculate the power of the earth's (clay) layer.
The newly created draft directive points out that for this system variant the previous legal requirements (60 cm condensed clay with a k _ value of 1 to 109 m / s) are no longer sufficient.
In the case of the narrow-wall process, the condensation of the substrate is achieved according to the respective geological conditions either by feeding or squeezing sealing masses (clay-cement and bentonite cement mixtures).
The gradient i of the wall area is calculated from the water level difference and the thickness of the sealing wall, while the gradient i is determined for the sealing horizon (tone, canyon) from the water level difference and the binding depth of the drop wall.
The sound acts as a semi-permeable membrane.
However, the anion exchange capacity is increased by the organic substance Kerogen, which can make up to 2 Gew.-% fine-distributed in tone.
Assessment of the lithological composition of the geological formation (in particular the distinction between clay and sand)
Here are objects made of iron and calcareous clay (bricks) with a matt, earth-coloured fracture (generally brown, red or yellow).
The R & D program for the in-situ qualification of the concept of final storage in deep clay formations has been continued.
The materials are to be tested in these laboratories as well as on site in clay, granite and salt formations.

The potters of Foini still form their vases after seismic anthropomorphic forms of clay.
The European coastal area is very long and consists mostly of sand, clay or chalk, i.e. soft, easily eroded materials.
The research was applied to the simulation of the following problems of practical interest: • BACCHUS 2 Test, performed in SCK / CEN in Belgium: Research into condensed, expansive clay for use as a technical barrier in references
These early characters on clay or stone were the first precursors of sophisticated linguistic tools, the development of which has not yet been completed.
The clay is first fitted with a layer of glass and then sintered in the fire at temperatures up to 1160 ° C in order to achieve the desired mechanical strength and hardness.
Since 1965, the German company Eisenhütte Westfalia-Lünen has been building small propulsion machines of the type mole, fox and roof, which are mainly used in soft rock (clay, plaster, pyrite).
100 g of earth (fertile, non-sterile earth) is suspended in 1 000 ml of chlorine-free drinking water (soil types with very high levels of clay, sand and organic carbon are unsuitable).
The results of the studies carried out under the PAGIS project were published in a five-volume edition: A short version (EUR 11775EN), clay (EUR 11776EN), granite (EUR 11777FR), salt (EUR 11778EN) and the undersea sediments (EUR 11779EN).
The sound, this formable material that our ancestors used for a variety of purposes, and which nowadays is used in areas as diverse as construction or the pharmaceutical industry, has, through its physical and chemical properties, attracted the attention of scientists and technicians who have the task of developing a safe and reliable system for the disposal of nuclear waste by digging in deep layers of rock.
The skin-like chemical component of the clay is an aluminium silicate, which is fire-resistant material, so that the clay is not a good heat conductor.
Figure 3: Sound and sound shale formations in the countries of the Community that would be suitable for the final disposal of highly radioactive waste (1980) and some sites of current in-situ exploration of clay rocks.

Nostalgia goes niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "comrade Detective"
This repetition of the story is simultaneously nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 "s, for the 90-year-old grunge era (when precincts David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the sketch comedy" The State "for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humour (it included an original story for a talking tin of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By sticking to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors playing horny children who grow up - they nevertheless created the impossibility of winning back the last part of the jokes.
"Ten Years Later," with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody is more about the foundational principle, including a riff on the stalker movies of the 90 "s such as" The Hand That Rocks the Cradle "(" The hand that looks the cradle ").
At one point, a character rumbles through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovely coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn't forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
And there's another crazy-vicious plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now endorsed by George H. W. Bush (a well-read impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the Excourses are the best part of the franchise.
It's especially fun to see the forever young Mr. Rudd showing Matt Dillon's lower lip of "Singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" Series until it reaches what I assume to be its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the gang as they will attend the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia: The Cold War revival of "The Americans," the movie "Atomic Blonde" and even "Glow" with its east-to-west ring-fight iconography.
The comedy with Rhys Thomas as director, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, admits to being a found TV series: A Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.

It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to reputation (the police spend the time looking at chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game 'Find the voice out'.
But "comrade Detective" is so committed to the veracity of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is included - that it often plays like a single one.
At six long episodes, it drags on, and the comedy isn't fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective," which has been edited to a lesser length, could better deliver its agitprop satire as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men devouring a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a fodder for a scholar.

Blow to drugs mafia in the country
The police have managed to strike a blow against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest-Baar county, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, the Konstanz prosecutor's office said on Friday.

As a result, the major operation was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning.
The investigations targeted mainly Italian nationals with close ties to the Italian mafia.
An incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, is also expected to go to the gang's account.

The federal government's refugee management officer, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has reportedly drawn attention to large gaps in the country's central register.
Flaws in the data registered there could "lead to some serious misdecisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, Weise warned in an analysis available to the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
According to the data, the register covers 10 million people with foreign nationality, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is therefore managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data has not been adequately maintained, the data quality in parts has not been good so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 had been found, "by people who are no longer alive, or by citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually appear in the register."
"Incorrect data input can significantly slow return processes," the report continues.
The statistics on departing people also cover EU citizens who do not have to leave at all.
However, such false assignments "led to a distorted debate about how to deal with expatriates," according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the German government appears to have begun sending refugee families with children under 16 back to Italy if they have entered from there.
That's according to an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung reports.
The paper therefore says the BAMF is reintroducing such procedures "concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and micro-children - to Italy since June 1, 2017."
Since late 2014, that was virtually no longer possible, according to the newspaper, citing the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin agreement, refugees are in charge of the EU state they first reach.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that state can send him back to the country of entry.
For justification, the office is now writing: "In the meantime, reception capacity for families with underage children has increased substantially in Italy."
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin agreement.
The home affairs spokesperson for the left-wing group in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticised this decision: "Families with children are at risk of inhumane reception conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the flaws in the Italian asylum system."

The allocation of cards is carried out in such a way that there is a separation of supporters of the playing teams by means of a division of subjects.
The so-called contingency of tickets, i.e. their distribution to the participating countries, takes into account the interest of fans in these countries in cards.
Fans must not be able to purchase tickets for a block in the stadium that is not intended for them.
The cards must contain information about the holder and the origin of the card so that their route can be traced.
Compliance with stadium bans will be achieved through the establishment of the system of reservation and distribution of tickets, as well as measures to avoid the transfer of the issued cards in whatever form.
- in principle, the buyer of the card is also the end user;
- the card includes the so-called supplement, in which the organiser in any case indicates
When allocating the available cards to the target groups, care must be taken to ensure that the general public and the fans of the participating teams have sufficient cards, in all fairness and to the extent permitted under the competition rules of the European Community.
If the reservation of a card is not made exclusively through the national football club or the own club of the spectator / fans, the interested party must indicate the team of which he is a fan.
A buyer receives no more than two cards.
The final handover of the cards takes place as late as possible (interchangeable vouchers).
The organizer must provide the assurance that the person on whose name the card was issued - the cardholder - will also receive his ticket.

The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weakening inflation tempered speculation of a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it kept interest rates on family incomes in the middle of intensifying pressure.
Policymakers at the Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members seeking an increase this month as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank reduced its 2017 growth forecasts to 1.7% and 1.6% for 2018, warning that pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the autumn.
But it signalled that rate rises would be needed over the next few years to rein in inflation fuelled by Brexit and it said borrowing costs may have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will call time on the funding plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February, although it has been said it is now expected to provide £15 billion more under this system - with £115 billion in sterling.
Minutes after deciding the interest rate, the bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term as pressure on household real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."
On interest rates, she repeated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and a "slightly larger" scale than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that increases would be "gradual" and "limited."
The bank's downwardly revised growth forecasts for this year and next year are in line with the 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent forecast in May.
It maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after that news.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31, falling 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision to make no change comes after recent disappointing growth figures dampened rising expectations of a rate hike and GDP rose to 0.3 per cent in the second quarter from 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
Growth is forecast to be 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the bank towards the end of the year.
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households hit by rising inflation and minor salary increases as the tightening first gets worse before it will then improve.
She added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" the drop in income over the next few years, but she added that wages will recover "significantly" at the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also bolstered by rising demand for UK goods, due to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after interest rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound's sinking.
The bank estimates it will likely take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy.
The call for a rate hike was up ahead of the bank's last ruling on interest rates as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for a rise to 0.5 per cent in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6 per cent last month from 2.9 per cent in June, although the bank said this was expected and it would rebound in coming months.
The bank said the excess relative to its 2% target was "entirely" attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is expected to become more competitive again as lenders vow to look for business and end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those where existing deals expire and who complete new mortgages, and many with fee-free options and low rates are becoming more popular. "
NHS (The National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a battle in the High Court against funding the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), taken before intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 per cent, is now being delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal last year upheld a Supreme Court ruling that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite claiming local authorities should fund it.
The move, announced on Thursday, was hailed as an "important new intervention" by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a "crucial moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to sign up and more clinics will follow in October before being introduced across England in April 2018.
Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in those at risk of infection.
Taking PReP before intercourse means just enough drugs are present in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken every day or so as early as two hours before intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and those with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Appropriate participants are identified in clinics who agree with the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also sign up for possible participation at their local participating sex clinic.
The program will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence of how it is targeted, absorbed and implemented on a large scale.
Mr Stevens said: "This major new intervention should complement and overhaul the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It's another milestone in the more than three decades of progress in addressing one of humanity's greatest health challenges. '
Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PReP, when targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access to this NHS-funded trial in England to develop a new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be for the study to be carried out quickly across the country and for no one who has a risk for HIV to be left behind.
Now that PrEP testing medicine has been procured, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV. '
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health secretary, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows just how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt takes us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it's important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are HIV-infected and that it will help bring us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society. '
Living the big life: Basement and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, narrowed from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It's on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's proof of the new design that Joanne hasn't packed and sold her bags.
"Before that, I was living in a much bigger room with my ex in Knightsbridge," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day. '
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overtaken.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and an intermediate level to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
'i wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement, "she says.
To that end, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill to use the 12.5-foot-high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling wasn't large enough to place two rooms over each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate level to stand in.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the default.
"The steelworks is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked over each other without us having to bask.
It wasn't just about building a simple platform, but laying the steel in a way that had the right height for the function up or down. '
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full over each other - with a lot of additional drama.
For the intermediate level, a classic copper-light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it work longer.
In the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all of Joanne's cutlery and glasses.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen if it is not used.
Foldable kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this one is that it's a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went into it," Erfan explains of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
'it's counterweight so when you push the door it glides very easily. '
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an extra 16 square feet, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you're going to sell the base area - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.
'in a rudimentary form, an estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on floor size. '
Here, they have managed to increase floor space while using high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things that touch you and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
'You don't fall in love with the electric sockets in the walls.
These are important but they don't play with your heart. '
It shows that an apartment can be transformed by good design and increased square footage from something more standard to something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you could choose not to leave them.
An architectural history with ups, downs and happy ending: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels in 1958 won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and cramped.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the preferred one, who had all the incidences and who had received all the prizes in advance (gastronomy competition Oster, audience vote on the best hand-made costume and Reina Madre), had "made the other female candidates jealous, which is why the queen was not able to shine on stage."
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "Como en casa" program at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the contest will not be Queen after all."

Brothers fight over a $500 million property empire
Two brothers are in a confrontation over one of Victoria's biggest property empires, worth more than $500 million, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.
Former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul, who took him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be split.
Paul has wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp confrontation over the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Along with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the Westco family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for US $85 million.
That money has been invested in property and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and shopping centres in the suburb.
Following an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third.
A court file says this means Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.
The division of real estate and cash has proved a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought were the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first Supreme Court hearing took place.
The brothers are also now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, ruled him out.
Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some possessions.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Costs are rising in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Ms De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessen shops dating back to the late 1950 "s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early Seventies.
They used security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my final years of high school when Paul was still a little kid (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property amicably to their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
Both Luke and Mark were, Paul says, "biting over the terms of their financial separation."
Colin has held back very much despite being a former AFL board member and the television star's best friend, according to a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied by SMS to say "I really can't say much" because the case is before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and move our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he was trying to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he was "still hoping for a solution."
On Friday, that hope appeared to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.

Kelly told staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information. "

President Trump's relationship with television stretches back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was angry because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from bodies that were trying to convince," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to make sure his personal media use includes a steady stream of praise."
Fine.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know to others - that Trump's tweets would have contained even more ignition without their interventions.
We'll probably never know anything about the tweets Trump didn't send.
If his staff managed to keep trouble away from him several times, then their efforts paid off.
But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House made up of competing parties keep trying to advance their own agenda by showcasing Trump material that may promote their views of the world.
Politico - entirely preoccupied with this story - reported in May on the advisers' preference for providing dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump, like a volcano, can respond to negative press clippings, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is sticking to finding out where these are from.
That's exactly what happened in late February, when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a bunch of leaks" at the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he has offered no specific evidence or that he has made false allegations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that the then chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and the White House general secretary, Rob Porter, have "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."
How did that work?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still seeking influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
In short, they fear that all the sacrifices made for price stability will have been in vain.

In the current boom, contagion has occurred within markets and across markets, as rising prices fuel enthusiasm - and thus further price rises - first within a city and then in other cities, even at the other end of the world.
Historically, home prices have developed a huge dynamic and prices in these cities are still rising rapidly, though this increase is already a little slower than it was a year or more ago.
Based on projections of growth trends, it seems certain that prices in most of these cities will rise significantly over another year or more, even if the rate of increase continues to fall.
Prices in glamour cities are likely to fall sharply in the next serious recession, or in the event of a shock to the local economy, as well as at soaring interest rates.
In that case, contagion within and across markets could set in motion a downward spiral and lower prices for years to come.
Travellers negotiate a ditch and return to the 'millionaires' row
Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are once again on war footing with some determined travellers who have negotiated a ditch drawn by the community to recover a field in front of their mansions.
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull called the "millionaire row."
They have brought in horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were only thrown out in May, but without being deterred by a ditch excavated by the council to prevent their seizures.
The takeaway group found a gap in the defense facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unobstructed to find a way.
Furious residents have pressed Solihull council, which said it was "useless to deal with the problem."
An anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday night after being sent on from Bentley Heath where they threw stones at the passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame, as it has been useless in dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably more today. '
She added: "Birmingham council knows how to deal with this by keeping long instructions to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue paying my council tax if the council can't even stop it. '
One local resident, who did not want to be named, said: "It's ridiculous, we've only just seen the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you've even seen a horse in the park area. '
A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorised camp in the countryside beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihulls police and we are taking the necessary legal action to ensure they move on as soon as possible.
To support our evidence collection, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps create a picture of the situation where the court has to consider when we present our case. '

From Birkenhof, Waldhotel Luise
The Waldhotel Luise is from the former Hotel Birkenhof.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and is due to reopen on March 1 next year.
This is good news for the city.
With the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH as of 13 April 2014, around 30 000 overnight stays a year were lost and also income from the tourist tax.
In the fall of 2014, in the face of dramatically rising numbers of refugees coming to the county, the hotel building was offered to the estate as a collection shelter, causing controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a plan to secure the area as a hotel site.
The decision was not uncontroversial in the local council at the time.
But Freudenstadden's Lord Mayor Julian Osswald in particular defended the hotel site and spoke of serious interested parties at the house even then.
He should be right.
The group Luisenhotels with CEO Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a three-star-plus-category house under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, there have been building shuttles in front of the entrance for quite some time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovations are being carried out.
Floors were ripped out, ceilings partially dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still a lot of work to be done by March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer, speaking to our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are built in.
Everything should later become "beautifully bourgeois," as Thomas Scherer puts it.
'We want to make a piece of jewellery out of it. '
A swimming pool, a wellness area and a meeting room are among the facilities.
You don't want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an upscale downtown level, Scherer points out.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its about 60 rooms, wants to set out wide, Scherer further explains.
Individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel at ease in the hotel.
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The city's ideas are in line with those of the hotel group.
'We're on the same line. '
Asked about the level of investment, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to set out exactly.
Just under €1 million, he reckons.
The exteriors are also brought to the front, which is already clearly visible.
A large terrace is created in a patio, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is open to the public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."
It's not an easy task, but it needs to be done now and there's no way around it.
The "much more important task" is on Sunday.
Not a single accident is the same and calculating the cost of the parts and working hours can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The basic models usually only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
The joke of the matter is that the firm occurs to the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone does not run on their behalf, so they cannot have full access to it as the normal customers of mobile operators. "
"In these places, travellers are also provided with a desk with trained staff that advises interested parties on the internet purchase and also plays the coupon on the map," said Martin Opatrný, the spokesman for the project.
A passenger who does not travel with suburban buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupon ends can in turn go to the self-service machines, where the coupons are played on the card.
The new elections are over, and now it's all about the Coalition; in the debates on public television, party leaders barely left in their cards.
Russia affair: Us special agent sets up Grand Jury
In the Russia affair involving US President Donald Trump, special agent Robert Mueller is said to have set up a so-called grand jury, according to a report.
The panel has begun work in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal wrote, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper claimed the move was a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified its investigation.
The CNN reported that there are already initial subpoenas from the panel related to a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. intelligence agencies have long blamed the Kremlin for purposefully interfering with the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there was collusion between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation will focus on several men who acted as advisers to the Republican during the campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also more and more took a look at Trump's private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special agent had personally brought Trump to the center and was investigating the allegation of whether the president may have obstructed justice in the wake of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine present evidence in potential criminal cases and to decide whether charges should be brought.
Grand juries are therefore also called prosecution chambers.
They are mostly turned on when they are major and controversial cases.
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.
The panel can also be turned on by the prosecution to charge people for questioning under oath.
According to CNN, subpoenas have already been issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his former campaign chief, Paul Manafort, were also at the conversation.
Legal experts said on US television on Thursday night that the establishment showed that Mueller was not intimidated in his work and that, if necessary, he wanted to act quickly.
However, it does not necessarily have to mean that the grand jury will end up being turned on to decide on the imposition of a charge.
Still, the establishment of the panel is the start of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
Amid the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to portray the Russia affair as a campaign by his political opponents.
"The Russia story is a total invention," Trump said.
The issue gives Democrats a way to "feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about."
His special counsel, Ty Cobb, said in an opinion that he knew nothing about the establishment of a grand jury.
But this also usually works in secret, he pointed out.
The White House is in favor of any action that accelerated the work of the special investigator in a "fair" way.
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that it is not investigating the president.
There was no reason to believe that anything had changed, the statement added.
But Mueller was only used after Trump fired Comey.
Because of that crackdown, allegations were made against Trump that he wanted to obstruct justice.
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop the investigation against then-national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under intense pressure over the investigation.
After representing US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and his associates.
That sparked speculation about whether Trump wanted to sack Mueller.
Unlike an independent congressional special investigator, such as in the Watergate affair of President Richard Nixon, who later resigned, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Justice Department at the president's insistence.
Several senators from both parties, however, want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators on Thursday presented draft legislation under which the special agent could no longer be so easily dismissed.
Antarctica: Gigantic iceberg drives in Antarctica
In West Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg of just under seven times the size of Berlin has been solved by the chasm.
The Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute of Polar and Marine Research announced Wednesday.
The colossus, which is over a trillion tons and 5800 square miles, is now tying north and will probably take two or three years to molten.
At 175 kilometres in length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants researchers have registered in the past three decades.
A danger to people doesn't go away from him.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in breaking the iceberg is unclear, according to research data.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shells in the region for about 30 years, the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this may be linked to global warming.
The colossus, which has now been aborted, has so far been a part of the Larsen C shotgun.
Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It thus grows further and further into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this cul-de-sac, the balance of waxes and breakdowns was disrupted a few years ago.
A complete shaft has disintegrated there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is some evidence that the Larsen C scarf is also in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it currently does.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can disintegrate if a piece breaks down at a key point.
The melting of shellfish and iceberg does not increase sea levels as they swim on the water and ice squeezes as much water as it produces after melting itself.
However, the loss of the shellfish causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and drain much faster than before.
This could possibly increase sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the UK's research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).
The Larsen-C shellfish is the fourth-largest chunk of Antarctica, with nearly 50,000 square kilometres, according to AWI data.
On the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 metres thick, at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 metres.
It breaks down there on a regular basis.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary of Britain's Swansea University.
"This is the most widespread withdrawal since records began," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it is controversial whether the Larsen C shellfish will now grow again or go back in the long term and may fade together, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, a great many ice shells of the Antarctic Peninsula have disintegrated in recent decades.
This long goat of Antarctica stretches towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Antarctic Peninsula's ice surface has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The decline has contributed to the rise in temperature.
The Antarctic Peninsula has been warming by around three degrees over the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where the temperature is rising fastest.
The Adaptation Fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member council, probably at the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as set out in the "Piac és Profit."

CDU wants house tariff on staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacant positions, the CDU is calling for it to step out of the employers' association to become more attractive.
It wasn't until just before the summer recess that the county swept through 41 new posts in administration.
More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now, once again, 17 apprentices have had their first day at work.
The apprenticeships at the circle seem to be very coveted.
Some 620 applications were made for the places to be awarded this year.
Yet the county still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
At present, there are still 50 unfilled vacancies at Mettmann County.
They are looking for, among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration.
The CDU would now like to take the initiative in the day, together with the FDP and the UWG, and counter the skills shortage in the administration.
The administration is expected to "work out a concept for recruitment and personnel development" at the request of the parties.
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract the shortage of candidates for the future, it says.
The overall approach should be oriented internally and externally, identify concrete measures for cross-entry and include a training offensive, the CDU, FDP and UWG demand.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the county is dealing with staff problems that you didn't know in the past.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms.
There is talk of real 'competition between public employers'.
This includes a high number of staff leaving the service due to illness or age.
It is high time for action, therefore, so that no more jobs are left unfilled.
But Klaus-Dieter oples, group leader of the CDU, is still going beyond the joint motion with his party.
He recently caused a frenetic surprise back in the day when he publicly questioned staff cost coverage and stunned the rest of the parties.
Peoples want all the options that make it possible to leave the local employers' association to be reviewed.
"If we do not come up with a satisfactory solution in the short term, the county administration should aim for a house tariff with the trade unions, perhaps also in cooperation with the circling cities," said Peoples.
In so doing, the CDU is trying to pay employees and civil servants better than the tariff regime for the public service actually provides for.
Salaries are currently exactly prescribed, and increases or more money are only available if you switch to a higher level based on professional years.
But the county's tasks have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitutes "Protection Act.
Not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers, Councillor Thomas Hendele and County Director Martin Richter have a problem: They have too few staff.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more for the Republican side to use the cards issued by those clubs for elections.

"Dedication, noble, tolerance, respect, trustworthiness."
He regretted that the divisions in the council and within the Syrian people and regional powers "make this situation intractable."
Italy tightens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs using rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue this if they do not abide by new rules governing their operations.
"If NGOs don't sign a new code of conduct, it's difficult to see how they can continue working," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis's warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German charity 'Youth Retained' because their team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The charity, which has only been in operation for a year, declined to comment on detailed allegations made by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our number one priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organization said in a statement on social media.
'We can only assess any allegations that are currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation. '
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the 'Youth Retained' boat, the Iuventa, since October.
It is believed his crew are taking tugboat migrants on board, which are delivered to them directly by traffickers, and that the smugglers can take off so the ships can be used again.
At least one such gathering reportedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.
The crew are suspected of flouting the authority of the Italian coast guard, which oversees rescue operations in the zone on humanitarian grounds rather than any other motives.
Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must primarily have an Italian police officer on board overseeing their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be seen as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve "substantial changes or obstructions" to their bailouts.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy following the rescue measures has fallen sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and work with local mayors have borne fruit.
"Over the last few days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
A modest home market compared to global sales.
The countries of Central and Eastern Europe have become more important to Switzerland since their accession to the EU, both as production sites and as sales and procurement markets.
When the price of oil hit the $150 a barrel mark, sales in the United States were already shifting in favor of more economical models.
At BMW, growth rates in sales for the first six months of the year were even 100 percent.
We also have this experience in investing in sales of road cars.
And he adds that providing information about a company's philanthropic activities is just as important as communicating sales or competitor information at board meetings.
Sales at TrueView-Ads, i.e. advertising clips played either before the start of a video or displayed as a display advertisement next to this one, also rose 45 percent last year.
The skilled industrial engineer (Berchten) and the robotics specialist (Guernier) are convinced that their product will find sales, and expect 80 000 to 100 000 airbags sold each year for the future.
Sales of computers, printers, servers and additional storage capacity will lag behind software and services for now, but will catch up over time and perhaps even drive up yields in the fiercely competitive PC market.
After a 10 percent decline from the previous year in the first quarter of 2013, PC sales to companies in the second quarter were at roughly the same level in the second quarter, suggesting a stabilisation in sales figures.
Rises and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the northern Palatinate to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
Vantage points followed, partly on towers, from which one could look far beyond the Pfälzer Forest and the upstream plains.
There have always been longer rises in between, for which long trials have been rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Once again, vantage point reignited at vantage point, connected by "floundering" trials and moderate rises.
On the last two days there were again many meters of altitude.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and return huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed healing brine in the open-air inhalatory.
New Town was also fired.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude, the group had met the Pfälzer Forest at its best - sporting and cultural.
Console instead of pitch - Bundesliga gears up for e-sports
Are the sport stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future instead of struggling through the stadium pitch in the wind and weather?
The fact is, e-sports has long become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gales included.
This has also been recognised by the first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly involved in this area.
The start was made by VfL Wolfsburg in 2015, followed by FC Schalke 04 and most recently VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two pros for the FIFA 17 computer game.
"We hope this will inspire entirely new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure "a number of clubs are still going up on this train."
Next weekend, the FIFA World Cup in London will be organising the first "Interactive Club World Cup," where the gamers of various clubs will compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal in particular with the 14 to 30-year-olds that young people are still going to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs were trying to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-athletes under contract, you could be present in these markets far more often online than just sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year.
What exactly is at stake?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or just the football simulation FIFA are challenged at competitive level.
Leagues have long been established, as in normal sport, where the pros compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, e-sports is already part of the official program.
But is it a proper sport at all?
For many, the notion is certainly ordinary.
Ingo Frobevil has also been grappling with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports School in Cologne, e-sports is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classical sport - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and rapid responsiveness.
Professional gamers should train not only at the console but also their bodies and pay attention to the diet.
"The fit player is a good player." "
But Frobous also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more of an issue."
Controls were difficult to implement in online games, and the scene lacked the structures of classic sport.
On the positive side, the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sports.
The players are travelling internationally, this is like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by the consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (Biu) says the e-sport is experiencing rapid growth.
In 2016, this meant that 50 million euros had been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to reach 130 million.
This, though, is little against the Football League's nearly €2.4 billion.
However, e-sports is "no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte advisers write.
Internationally, many countries are already on.
Major markets are Asia and the United States, where former basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in U.S. team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport betting company Unikrn.
There are a lot of things happening in Europe, too.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports was introduced as a teaching subject, says Frobevil.
In the Netherlands and France, football first-team clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department, according to Mr Dutt.
"In the European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB CEO Röttgermann.
Just falling into nostalgia, and clearing the old days, is no longer enough today.
It is about preserving the tradition of the club, but at the same time aligning the company in the modern market.
"We live in a digitised world," Mr Dutt also says.
'Because you can't hold on to the fact that only when it comes to football everything stays the way it always was. '
Unfortunately, the European system of government arts funding is falling victim to slow economic growth and growing budget deficits.
An immediate deployment of an appropriate civilian and security presence during the months immediately following the NATO bombing campaign in 1999 might have created appropriate protections against the backlash that caused victims to become perpetrators.
Under one of these projects, developing countries will be provided with medical information via the Internet, another project will provide communication equipment and experts for use in emergencies and humanitarian emergencies, and a third will aim to provide vaccination coverage to significantly more children worldwide.
However, access to resources is only part of the problem and I would like to reiterate the importance of denouncing the production, distribution and use of these indiscriminate weapons.
The Forum, which successfully concluded its fourth meeting in February 2000, deals in particular with forest issues from the point of view of sustainable forest management, addressing not only the underlying causes of deforestation, but also trade in forest products and the use of market-based instruments for the conservation of forests.
Through its "Network for Sustainable Development" programme and through partnerships with the private sector, the United Nations Development Programme promoted the use of free software and provided information on sustainable development in a wide range of languages.

Poison eggs ade - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking
Almost all states are now affected by the scandal over poison-contaminated eggs.
Aldi South and Aldi Nord have responded, removing all eggs from sale across Germany.
Only eggs that have been shown to contain no fipronil are to be taken to the shelves.
In this performance very balanced meeting, however, Marcus Blasutto's TSV team consistently voted for the great physical effort and a pleasing commitment from both teams.
The Council is currently examining the extent to which these mechanisms are included in Article 7.
We therefore ask the rapporteur, the Commission and the Council to supplement the agricultural policy part with the fisheries policy part, for example by making 'agricultural and fisheries aspects of enlargement' out of the title 'agricultural aspects of enlargement'.
I would particularly like to address the Council, which, unfortunately, is essentially absent but has some expectations and concerns.
The compound feed industry has now tried again to influence the Council and overturn the open declaration.
I would like to point out to the honourable Members that the Council working group has unanimously decided to recommend to the Council that a joint committee be set up in the action programme to increase the influence of the individual Member States through a combination of management and advisory procedures.
In our view, the report contains a disagreement on the issue on which my group does not agree, namely whether the creation of an internal auditor should be required only for the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament, or even for the smaller institutions.
Two examples: The Education Council, in conjunction with the agenda item on the mobility of students and teachers, because we have found great inequality in mobility, and the Internal Market, Consumption and Tourism Council in connection with the agenda item on the development of e-commerce, in order to make it accessible to all women and men, because here too, as we know, there is inequality between women and men.
I must therefore concede that this amendment, as the Council and the Commission stated, is not justified in this case, and I would once again like to take this opportunity to remind you that the procedures of import controls in the European Union are not working, that fraud is being committed and that these cases of fraud are not only bad for the Community taxpayer, but also bad for the functioning of the internal market and even for fairness towards third countries.
The Commission and the Council will do yours, and that is the most important thing on the agenda in Yugoslavia at the moment; that has always been our interest.
As far as the Intergovernmental Conference is concerned, I believe that the work before Biarritz at ministerial level has already progressed as far as possible, and the informal Council therefore took place at the right time to confirm certain progress in order to provide guidelines for the final stage in which we now find ourselves.
Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate the European Council for adopting the draft Charter as binding.
Meeting the demands of the large countries for more power in the Council and Parliament would disrupt the balance within the European Union and lead to small countries paying the full price for enlargement.
We must support the efforts of Mr Prodi and Mr Patten to strengthen the Commission's capacity to act through parliamentary insight and the necessary parliamentary scrutiny, which does not relate to the Council and Mr Solana.
Although we share the criticism of the Council on many points, it remains to be seen that it would be a politically unmediated confrontation and would undermine credibility in European institutions.
I do not want the impression that the Council is not responding to the questions put to it.
The Council is actively examining the Commission's proposal and the amendments mentioned in order to reach an opinion on this issue as soon as possible.
At the time, we did not know that, from these funds, the Council and the Commission had promised aid for the reconstruction of Serbia and Kosovo.
Mr President, the Council has really surpassed itself with the draft budget it presented for 2001.
In this respect, and also in view of the Commission's admission that the Member States' requests for payments for the Structural Funds for 2001 exceed the estimates of the PDB by EUR 8 billion, I think it is time for the Council to think very seriously now that we should do something about payments and not increase the 'RAL'.
In due course, such support and signalling will also be required vis-à-vis the Council.
Several proposals are already before the Council and Parliament, such as the package of proposals to recast and update the hygiene rules.
I would therefore ask you to convey to the Council, which is not here, and to the Commission, the importance of increasing this amount, since, unfortunately, between 20 and 50 new ones are laid for each large mine.
The abandonment of the requirement for closer cooperation within the framework of the Treaty, as well as the abolition of the right of veto and the possibility of presenting the issue to the European Council, would be in breach of fundamental principles of European cooperation within the EU.
The General Affairs Council agreed in October last year to the first five action plans for Somalia, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Morocco and Iraq.
The committee responsible has followed me in this, and the signals from the Council are also pleasingly positive.
The Council will have to ask itself whether, by awarding candidate status to Turkey, it has not harmed this concern any more than it has used it.
At its meeting in Feira in June 2000, the Council adopted a common EU strategy for the Mediterranean and, having proposed and enforced the reform of the MEDA Regulation, the European Commission recently presented a document on the intensification of the Barcelona Process.
The Commission and the Council express their willingness to do so.
What diplomatic initiatives does the Council intend to take in the interests of rapprochement with Armenia / Azerbaijan, the resolution of their bilateral differences and the promotion of their cooperation?
Secondly, the Council refers in its response to NATO as Pontius Pilate, without commenting on Turkey's provocative violation of the sovereign rights of Greece, which was expressed this time on the occasion of the NATO maneuver.
However, other countries definitely want the compensation fund, and I have to tell you quite frankly that if we were to propose a compulsory introduction of the compensation fund now, the result would be that we could forget the whole thing, because there would never be a majority for this in the Council.
I would like to give an example: As you know, there have been difficulties for the Council in banning the export of products deemed unsafe to third countries, while this ban is very important to the European Parliament and we fully support it.
The Garot report aims to improve the Commission's proposal in some respects by trying to find a compromise solution with the Council, in particular for financial participation in the fund.
The Council of the European Union, in cooperation with your institution and the European Commission, also plays an active role in updating and constantly strengthening European rules to prevent and combat this disease.
The Commission and the Council of the European Union have a heavy responsibility for the scale of the crisis in relation to mad cow disease.
Parliament can be proud that the proposal to establish this academy was born here, and we are grateful to the Portuguese Presidency for taking it up and thank the Commission and the Council for their support.
A declaration will also be prepared for the European Council on the economic, social and cultural characteristics of sport and its social function in Europe.
His voice would be stronger, and the voice of ministers defending agriculture in the service of sustainable development would also be much stronger in the Council if it could be based on decisions taken here in the codecision procedure.
As requested by Mr Brok in his report, the Council will have overview documents detailing relations between the Union and the individual partner countries in order to make better use of the Union's overall efforts in order to increase its efficiency and better prepare its debates on external action.
I would also like to point out that, within the framework of all the positions taken by the Council, there is no budgetary obligation on the part of the European Union to finance any military activity.
Furthermore, it is completely illogical that only the Council can amend the Financial Regulation, and we repeat our conciliation motion on this point.
On many points, as Mr Watts has already explained, the European Parliament takes a stricter stance than appears to be the case in the Council.
Discussions have also been held with the sectors concerned and there have been numerous contacts with the French Presidency with a view to reaching a consensus text which can be swiftly adopted by the two legislative bodies, the Council and the European Parliament.
I would like to say to Mr Jarzembowski that the Council is not seeking a compromise.
"It is clear that there can be an incompetent and provocative official, but if 15 Member States agree to such answers, I think you must take the initiative and encourage the Council to respect a prerogative of Members of the European Parliament.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that the debate on proportionality (votes in the Council and seats in Parliament), that is, the balance of power between the Member States, has opened up a pandoraby that will be difficult to close again in Nice.
The report has been the subject of difficult discussions in the Council.
I have been told by my chairman of the Committee on Budgets that this is the first time that an agreement has been reached between the Council and Parliament in a conciliation procedure.
Ultimately, it was the weighting of votes in the Council that was most debated and where it was most difficult to reach a decision.
As a representative of the groups in the European Free Alliance, I would like to warn the Commission, but above all the Council, in the event that the EU does not want to be more than an intergovernmental community.
But the Nice European Council, like many other summits in the history of the European Union, represents a victory for reality, a victory for pragmatism over utopia.
If the Council wanted to do that, it would be unmindful and unwise.
Secondly, has the Council been informed by the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights, who is well represented on the ground?
What improvements will the Council make to Directive 92 / 12 / EEC, which is referred to here, so that the responsibilities of the supplier and the recipient are clearly defined without the possibility of fraud?
In accordance with Article 23 of the EU Treaty, such a decision will be taken unanimously by the Council, as will all other decisions with defence implications.
Mr President, as the Groupement Européen des Sociétés d'Auteurs et de Compositeurs rightly points out, the draft we are discussing here has been attacked in a measured way in the course of its examination by the Council.
Secondly, this issue will be on the agenda next Friday at the Telecommunications Council.
At the trialogue meeting, it became clear that the Council was not prepared to make concessions on this issue.
The precautionary principle was also discussed at the Nice Summit, which took note of a resolution adopted by the General Affairs Council.
The 2001 budget is largely based on a compromise between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, which we support.
The Nice European Council had a positive aspect: With the decision on a new weighting of votes and a new distribution of MEPs with the participation of the eastern European candidate countries, it gave it a strong signal of its willingness to start it as soon as possible.
Michelle Carter convicted of the texts urging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two-and-a-half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended.
Carter was convicted in June of negligent homicide of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Mr Roy's father told the hearing on Thursday: "My family is uncomforting.
My son was my best friend. '
Carter was allowed to remain free pending appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream-coloured blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and downward-facing eyes as she was sentenced.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She took no responsibility, "she said.
'she's shown no remorse. '
But Carter's attorney said it was a "terrible circumstance she completely regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find out that her "age or maturity, or even her mental illness, has a significant impact on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, who said there was "not a day when I'm not praying the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything; I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity, "it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was "tracked" by the realisation that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
"No longer having this single person I've been with every day since I was born is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems set to set a legal precedent as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang up, spring from a building, create yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she sent in the two weeks before his death while on holiday with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn the generator on and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case through any press.
The case has divided legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British co-worker in Italy in 2007 before being acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, aged 30, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not jail."

Joshua kimmich: Learning from FC Bayern's new mini-Lahm
The fact that Joshua was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is no accident.
FC Bayern are mourning the Confed Cup winner a big season - extra motivation is not damaging there.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, which saw Joshua kimme immediately, even if the extra garment was very, very small.
But as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer could be seen, he made the binge assigned to him to the arm.
"The coach didn't announce it," the Confed Cup winner told me afterwards, after his first effort as Bayern captain.
Well, the stand could have been better than at 0-2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign from the coach could also indicate kimme like that.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been chosen as a game leader in the C-Elf, made up of youth players, debutants and just out of holiday, but he.
You'd love to distribute sugar to those you trust a lot, who you want to keep at a whim.
So if you've been chosen to take on the legacy of Lahm, you can only use a little extra motivation well.
Kimmich confirmed: "That's what you want as a player: Take responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flopped across the field as a mini-Lahm.
Right back, that's now his position, the white binge on the arm did its rest.
And at all, in this starting formation, kimmich acted like the one who can best take the helm as well.
He gave instructions, trying to steer the inept force.
He had the gaze for the whole thing, while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal with overplaying his lack of fitness (barely scrambled); Renato Sanches with connecting on devils come out to the achievements of the Asia trip (also hinged only partially); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Southern with not falling negative in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
That, after all, worked out quite well.
Southern ran alongside kimmich, Rudy in front of the defence, and both were sovereign.
The well-known Napoli Storm were frequently struggling, and Southern also tried to be successful a couple of times in the build-up to the game.
His colleague Mr Rudy, though, admitted the result was "not as we hoped."
But he also showed a decent performance on debut.
Game shifting, change of pace: "I was picked for that style, too."
How unfamiliar this Bayern world still is for the new entrants was seen following the game.
Rudy, for instance, didn't give one or two in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich passed away after a few crisp statements in the back of his new fellow players.
There, he heard an interesting phrase from Southern: "What's going on here, I've noticed now.
At Bayern you just have to win every game. ""
After all, he no longer has to teach the new.
Alaba motivates ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's most famous footballer has reported on Twitter just before the game and wished the ÖFB ladies well.
The Bavarian Legionnaire is almost a club-mate of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and fiddles with our Ladys.
The tweet from the Austrian football player of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational injection.
Our ladies might well need the famous Bayern-Dusel as well.
It was revealed in court that Ditta was a 'regular consumer' of cocaine after Class A drugs were discovered in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards during tests.
It was revealed in court that he had called key drug trafficking players, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed them of what investigators knew about them.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
In court, the defendant initially claimed he was suffering from severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died alongside him in an explosion.
The court did not have to hear any of the damaged women.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700-page law, and also argued that the health-care law's requirement that states either have to expand access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise remove all state Medicaid funding is not unconstitutionally restrictive.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered outside the court to cheer on the new president, and unlike the presidential prunk from the Mubarak era, traffic was stopped only for a short time to allow the auto-convoy to cross the usually busy road connecting the city center with the southern suburbs.
But by placing the official zeal before the court, rather than as usual before parliament, he is bowing to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
It is difficult for rocker in court to almost always abide by a law that is for them - and not to testify.
Company happy with Rhineland-Palatinate minister: Economy praises Wissing's pace
It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still the economy minister of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new economy minister, Volker Wissing (FDP), is in office.
Chambers and businesses from the region speak on T V's question of a change in economic policy - and, at the same time, blame the old minister.
Frank natus, chairman of the Association of Trier Companies (VTU), says, "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked."
Natus sees the biggest U-turn in infrastructure policy: The leak of highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now high on the country's list of priorities.
Later this year, the ministry hopes to launch a planning process, and the construction law will be in place by 2021.
A role in the country's plans is also played by the western bypass of Trier, which is in urgent need of the federal transport route plan.
The aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020, says ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a signpost to prop up regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier is seeking a Rhineland-Palatinate label on wine, as suggested by Wissing, to increase sales in supermarkets and halt the trend of the German wine export, which has been slowing for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, the IHK praises.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new master bonus as an additional incentive for young apprentices, says managing director Matthias Schwalbach.
There will be a premium of €1000 for the passing master test and €2500 if graduates become self-employed within ten years of the master's training.
However, the homework list for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction, facts are quickly to be created, at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, chief executive of IHK Trier.
Of 56 new engineers that Wissing plans to hire at the state-run Mobility, only 29 posts have been filled so far.
IHK is calling for more orders to be awarded to external offices.
CDU group vice-president Christian Baldauf points to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country is investing more than €20 million less in maintaining national roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
Frank natus also expects a concept of the country as it seeks to address skills shortages in the region.
The previous broadband expansion in the country was also sobering.
In 2016, regional companies only rated network supply at the grade of 3.4 in an IHK survey.
They complained about stockpiling internet connections and breakdowns.
Former Business Secretary Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is out of politics right now and still sits on the supervisory board of wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green group left Lemke for April to become president of a private college in Karlsruhe - where she already cleared the field again after four months because of disagreements.
They learned these lessons so well that when government officials in Shanghai, who by the low birth rate and the ageing population suddenly began to change course this summer and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediate and final: "Absolutely not."

Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - automakers face a backlash
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes "there are smarter options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the ventures as a recall.
European carmakers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to carmakers of installing plants to neutralize the fumes emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with chugging the powerful car firms and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes, which include the use of so-called shutdown devices that could regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car has been tested but go back in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen employees have been indicted in the United States, while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in Audi's engine development was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi became involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was expanded.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: The luxury carmaker contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen's profit.
Instead of immediately helping the Röszke camp to establish structures that guarantee humanity, our Federal Chancellor has, in a highly official and public way, put the attitude of the Hungarian government in the dark circle of Nazism.
When the negotiations began six months ago, it was Britain's turn to take over the presidency in the European Council.
This is exactly what the European Commission did recently when it presented its first post-Kyoto strategy, which will be discussed by the European Council in March.
The Commission's task is to monitor the practical application of this legal framework within the framework of its role laid down by the Treaty.
I therefore consider it entirely appropriate, in this case, to entrust an external and morally incontestable authority with this task.
That remains a task for the future.
Madam President, it has been mentioned what the role of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs might be.
Enlargement has presented you and all of us with the same task that Monnet and Schuman and others faced fifty years ago: A method of developing a structure and a vision for the future of Europe.
This message has the float on the Isar on Saturday
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for the Isar visitors to take part as well, a float passes through Munich tomorrow Saturday, which has a special message.
If you take it to the Isar again on Saturday, you will see a big float there between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is not a common float, with Isar tourists.
But the construction company wants to educate.
On the raft you can see a large infotransparent.
It shows a rubbish mountain.
The start of a publicity campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True Love is..." aims to sharpen the understanding of the Isar as a protective wild river.
Last summer the raft drove over the Isar and again this year there are other actions and measures to achieve considerate and environmentally conscious behaviour.
The European Monetary Policy Cooperation Fund (EFWZ), led by a Management Board composed of the members of the Committee of Presidents of the Central Banks and a member of the Commission, has the main task of ensuring the functioning of the European Monetary System (EMS), created in March 1979 as a replacement for the "queue."
However, this monetary mechanism of the EMS differs from that of the "snake" by the fact that the EMS has been accepted by all Member States (with the United Kingdom and Greece not yet participating in the intervention mechanism), so that it is a Community system.
However, this monetary mechanism of the EMS differs from that of the "snake" by the fact that the EMS has been accepted by all Member States (with the United Kingdom and Greece not yet participating in the intervention mechanism), so that it is a Community system.
This was the mechanism known as the "snake in the tunnel" (European currency snake).
The "snake" represented the narrower fluctuation width allowed for intra-Community currency exchange, while under the name "tunnel" the larger fluctuation width, as granted for the exchange of Community currencies in dollars, was to be understood.
In the meantime, the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (established in 1973 to manage the queue in the bandwidth mechanism) continues to serve as a precursor to the new institution.
It is forbidden to hunt, catch, disturb, kill, acquire, damage, sell, transport or hand over to other persons (in Upper Austria, most birds and snakes, as well as all lizards and amphibians).
Banotti just something that he cares more about snakes than horses.
He did a lot for our snakes but he didn't care about our horses. '
I have too much respect for the dogs, they are supposed to catch the snakes, our caravan continues with the calm certainty that every non-European invasion in the evening was followed by a Poitiers, a Lepante, a Vienna.
Targets c. In 1972, the "snake in the tunnel" mechanism reduced the fluctuation widths between the common currencies (snake) versus the bandwidths between these currencies and the dollar (tunnel).
The price stability mechanism was joined and re-emerged, and the snake, originally conceived as a community-based agreement, was reduced to a zone of monetary stability around the DM.
(Snake) to ± 2.25% and the fluctuation spreads between these currencies and the dollar (tunnel) to ± 4.5%.
Community weighting to 2.25% (the "snake") was further applied by the original Member States of the Community and Denmark; the fluctuation of these currencies against the dollar (the "tunnel") was limited to 4.5%.
The return of the French franc to the queue, the relatively satisfactory functioning of this system and the introduction of a European accounting unit were characteristic of this development.
In 1975, negotiations were held on the inclusion of the Swiss franc in the "queue" in order to contribute to greater exchange rate stability in Europe.
The corollary of this was that there were always difficulties in the foreign exchange markets: The French franc departed from the "queue," the pound and lira had to suffer sharp falls in international currency markets, and Deutsche Mark was upgraded to relieve the snake.
Adjustment of the intervention rate within the "queue"; the headline rate of the DM will be upgraded by 2% vis-à-vis the ERE.
Two exchange rate adjustments have been made within the "queue," both affecting Scandinavian currencies.
In setting prices for 1978 / 79, this limit was reduced, but increased again as a result of exchange rate changes in floating currencies and revaluations within the queue.
In the start-up period of the system, Member States not involved in the queue will be able to opt for slightly more bandwidths for a limited period of time.
The question remains whether it will be able to resist the ups and downs that brought down the "snake."
The former "floated," the latter were involved in the snake and could only fluctuate in a given frame.
In the EMS, the accounting unit valid for the "queue" will be replaced by the ECU corresponding to the value of the ERE, which is about 21% below the value of the "queue accounting unit."
However, the UK and Ireland, followed by Italy, are leaving the "queue."
However, the European Rut can also have undeniable successes: The British renegotiations of 1975. the general direct election of the European Parliament and, on 12 March 1979, the introduction of the European Monetary System (EMS), which replaced the 'queue'.
This construction was known as the 'snake in the tunnel', with the fluctuations between the Community currencies the snake and the external fluctuation limits approved by the IMF formed the tunnel.
The three candidate countries, the UK, Ireland and Denmark, joined the queue in May 1972 but were unable to comply with the discipline involved and left the queue after a few months.
At the beginning of 1974, France and Italy also left the queue, which thus consisted of only a small number of currencies under the leading position of Deutsche Mark.
This was the birth of the "snake in the tunnel."
The snake was thus half as wide (2.25%) as the tunnel (4.5%).
It was also decided that interventions aimed at keeping European currencies within the queue should, in principle, take place in European currencies, while dollar interventions should only be allowed to prevent the snake from breaking out of the tunnel.
The EEC Commission then proposed a common float of European currencies against the dollar - that is, retaining the snake, which was supposed to leave the tunnel - including the possibility of changing parities within the queue within certain limits and under certain conditions.
In September 1974, the French finance minister, Mr Fourcade, proposed a plan for "concerted floating" of all Community currencies aimed at achieving closer coordination between the five snake currencies and the four separate floating currencies.
As a starting point, he recommended the previous snake, but wanted to surround it with a kind of wider and more elastic "boa" that would include the European currencies outside the queue.
This outer shell could have larger bandwidths than the snake and include any option to join and exit the currencies.
In December 1975, in his report on the European Union, the Belgian Prime Minister, Mr Tindemans, developed a series of proposals to consolidate the queue, which should have a Community character and extend its action to the key areas of economic and monetary policy.
According to Leo Tindemans, the strengthening of the snake should also encourage the gradual return to more international monetary stability, with the first stage being to create larger stability zones in the world in which exchange rates would be kept stable.
This target zone for the floating currencies should gradually move to the queue where the weighting would shift in favour of the snake.
Some may see nothing more in the European Monetary System than an expanded and revamped "snake."
As with the snake, belonging to the EMS is also voluntary.
Although France, Italy and Ireland have decided to participate alongside the former snake countries (i.e. BR Germany, Denmark and the Benelux countries), in 1978 Britain decided to remain outside the exchange rate mechanism, which is the essential part of the EMS.
The obligations associated with participation are broadly similar to those that existed within the queue: A currency may fluctuate at most by 2.25% on both sides of its bilateral parity relative to another (but for the Italian lira this range is currently 6%).
- The distance between these two ECU courses is used as a basis for calculating the deviation indicator, which is a novelty of the EMS compared to the queue.
There has been a long debate as to whether the intervention requirement should be determined in relation to the ECU or using the parity grid according to the example of the snake.
However, the Member States that did not belong to the "snake" in December 1978 (namely France, Italy and Ireland) had the option of choosing larger bandwidths of up to 6%.
- Internal monetary policies: These include, in particular, interest-rate policies that can directly influence the movement of capital and contribute to easing tensions, as the experience of the "snake" has shown.
The mechanism of the deviation indicator has thus brought two important innovations to the queuing system: For the first time, there is an objective basis for triggering consultations between the competent authorities; this goes well beyond the purely fundamental agreement of consultations left to the participants' initiative.
Entry into force of the Basel Agreement, which introduces a system of reduced bandwidths in the EEC - the snake (2.25% band width) in the tunnel (+ 2.25%).
The pound sterling, the Irish pound and the Danish crown join the queue.
The Danish crown leaves the queue.
The Italian lira leaves the queue.
The Norwegian and Swedish krona join the queue.
The Swedish krona leaves the queue; depreciation of the Danish and Norwegian krona by 5% against the ewre.
Norway is leaving the queue.
In Chapter II, these earlier attempts are summarised once again, from the formulation of a number of objectives in the Treaty of Rome to the concerted float of certain European currencies in the 'queue'.
Chapter III gives a detailed account of the content of the EMS and its mechanisms (exchange rate and intervention mechanism, role of the ecu, credit systems), in particular highlighting the innovations of these mechanisms in relation to the "queue," and analyzing the conditions for proper functioning in abstracto.
In the start-up period of the system, Member States not involved in the queue will be able to opt for slightly more bandwidths for a limited period of time.
Two areas of Community activity have so far been excluded from the scope of the ERE: The transactions of the European Monetary Cooperation Fund, which were based on ewre, an accounting unit based on the headline rates of the snake's currencies, and the common agricultural policy, which used the "representative rates," the equivalent of which was fixed in national currencies by Council decision.
The applicant countries are also joining the "queue."
The English and Irish pounds are leaving the queue.

Mordillos Knollennasen and the laughter against the suffering
At times, Mordillo was one of the most-published cartoon characters, and his characters "growls are his trademark.
Even at 85, the Argentine is still recording and working on a film.
His message: Laugh, "because there's too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born in Buenos Aires on August 4, 1932, as the son of Spanish immigrants.
In his early years as an artist, he proposed himself as a character for congratulatory cards, among other things - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.
After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he made the breakthrough in the late 1960s: With the release of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
The artist was always inspired by cities.
Large, rundown Mordillo figures tumble in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own data, he still sits at the drawing table today, working nearly ten hours a day.
Through calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, T-shirts, plumes and watches, his droll characters continue to find a lot of spread around the world.
He has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters for six years.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousandth as an opponent.
For the first time, his characters are speaking in the 3D film, which is due to come to the cinema screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird for me," Mordillo says.
The script is not written by him.
That's why he is more likely to rely on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced in a wordless manner.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to meet its obligations, France spends just 10 cents, including a comparable bet.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is at risk of climate change.
The lavender is in decline because of conditions reminiscent of drought and because of the disease-carrying insects, causing major headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the lifespan of lavender.
There's also a small cicade, a micro-bacterium that transmits dwarf cicades, and in very dry weather there are a lot of them. '
And the stakes are high.
Lavender oil not only attracts holidaymakers, it's also very much in demand for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: 'Instead of having very long plant clocks with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil. '
Solutions being considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and developing varieties that are more resilient to drought.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret we didn't score one or two more goals. '

The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
Staff at the weekly Riodoce normally meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organized crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They have been told it is important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: They are supposed to take their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: Opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and abdominal feelings are enough.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the government or cartels payroll, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no respite from the violence, and while bodies are mounting across the country, more and more journalists are in attendance: At least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, with 589 under federal protection after attacks and threats and so far this year there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter is her editor and her inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.
His absence is deeply felt, though his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing off his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building, with two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts showing off his smiling face with glasses or his typical panamahut.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.
Although a probe federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to handle the cases of journalists, it has opened only two criminal cases, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As with most thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are uncomforting and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.
With no information about the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
'as long as we don't know the Why, we distrust everyone. '
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks wide before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was forced out of his car and shot at him 12 times, presumably because of the newspaper's name - which translates to "Twelfth River."
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
Rumours tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.
But there is virtually nothing but silence on the subject of Valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields as rival factions here fight to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't make sense that in Sinaloa, someone or several people are shot on the street every day, or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are bigger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "calm" when only one cartel has control of the coastal state, with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes to the United States.
Still, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is broken with guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He believes two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the release of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman's sons.
This release may have angered the sons, and suspected gangmembers bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to compel Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after seizing another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He served as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold $50 holdings.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to pursue journalism without encountering the narcotics problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were intrigued by a publication in which they could read stories no one else dared to deal with.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Prize" for her reporting in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the Committee to Protect Journalists' International Press Freedom Award for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever she went.
He voluntarily admitted he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October.
'You have to take on the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid.
I don't want to be asked, 'What did you do in the face of so many totals... why didn't you say what was going on?'
The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table there.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his spoil?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive in the process.
"They don't like dealing with their women, their children, their clean shops, their secretive runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best of times, is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell is a sense that can be misled... and then things happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No cell phones were suddenly allowed in the room where Riodoce's employees met for security training, and days earlier it was announced that spyware, sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half in the joke, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of police officers the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It's been months since reporters went to the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's issue, Riodoce has leaned on three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government spending focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word on who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was required when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows: That the restaurant is a favourite local of drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled all political levels for nearly the entire century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in that local area, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military assault.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have viewed Valdez's column as the best-informed source about the kidnapping.
"In the past, we'd already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slim body stature.
'Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken. '
Valdez's office has been rededicated to the storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists because the employees have become something they themselves never expected: Activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to the prosecutor's office the next morning for a demonstration for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
A burned body has been discovered and officials say, based on DNA testing, that it is his.
Across the country, journalists have become more vocal by writing "SOS Press" on pavements and buildings in organized protests.
That day, the director, Bojorquez, is away in Washington, trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was assassinated, Ramirez blamed the authorities for spying on journalists and letting them kill them for telling the truth.
She has since asked for her to be re-divided by the government because she is concerned her anger has hurt her objectivity.
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, government officials involved in it and an equal society.
In his last book, "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who stomped under a blanket with organized crime.
Last year, the media watchdog group "articulo 19" assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut," Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a chilling effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to her separated head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava breach in March.
Others continue, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of its director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the headline "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home states, or even out of the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile and they're still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as appears to be the case with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women at an apartment in Mexico City three months after escaping from Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it's a daily dance with risky choices.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue was already over, Riodoce's editors sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when at once all their phones started to sum up.
A series of shootings involving gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a series of cartel embassies in the region.
From the onboard edge, they have released the news on Riodoce's website via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens howled nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the policemen holding guard to see if they were in readiness.
If they were afraid at all, they didn't show it.
Under the enormous portrait of the newspaper's fallen founder, whose middle finger was visible to the whole of Sinaloa, Riodoce's staff followed his tracks.
"How can you also just think of closing," Bojorquez said, "if on the same day that Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the streets for reporting."
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling would have "missed" an opportunity to show he was serious about reducing the deficit by turning down the decisions until after the election.

Thousands of people have been arrested and dozens killed in Iran following the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leading to the biggest street protests since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Sacked presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some protesters who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in prison in August and others raped.
Amnesty recognized that the Iranian parliament and judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the post-election unrest and the government's responses to it, but so Amnesty said the credentials and power of those organs would be unclear and the results that would have been won by parliamentary committees had not been made public.
Eide has rejected all the accusations, but he also said that the allegations made by Galbraith - who was fired - "undoubtedly caused harm to the mission because there was already a large degree of scepticism about international meddling in the election."

But the sister, unfortunately, disagreed; she had become accustomed, but not entirely unjustifiably, to standing up as a particularly expert to the parents when discussing the affairs of Gregor, and so even now the mother's advice for the sister was reason enough to insist on the removal of not only the box and the desk she had first thought of, but the removal of all the furniture, with the exception of the essential canapee.

"If you ask me for advice," she said after she finished her prayer and made her face free, "so I advise you not to do it.
"Please, just follow my advice," the old prince said; "put a sheet of paper over the input and damp it with rum, then it will never melt even without ice."
On Ljewin's advice, Darja Alexandrowna drove off before sunrise.
But decent medical treatment and seaside baths in the summer have restored his health and now I have given it to the doctor's advice on the school.

Dinosaur used camouflage to soften its enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Nashorns of a Canadian miner have been preserved so well that experts have described it as the "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
It was so well-preserved that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said she'd had something of a "troubled past."
The report in the journal Current Biology described it as "the best-preserved armoured dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the chalk period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly well-preserved condition has puzzled researchers who describe it as' truly remarkable '
According to reports in National Geographic, the armoured herbivore is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk as he grub at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, March 21, 2011.
He hit something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years trying to uncover the feral animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) earth stump.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you just blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it slept," said the principal, Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
'it will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs. '
Researchers have found that despite being covered with an armor and resembling a changing tank, this herbivore was likely threatened by flesh-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators and used a shielding technique known as a counter-coating, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to better blend into its surroundings and soften its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaur family first made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours uncovering it carefully.
The astonishing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor across his body.
They discovered counter-shading, a common defence method in the animal kingdom, meaning the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although counter-shading is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from flesh-eating dinosaurs that evolution favoured the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use counter-shading - think robes, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signalling that this nodosaur was exposed to a real struggle to survive.
"Strong predator behaviour on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur shows just how dangerous the dinosaur predators of chalk time must have been," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows the dinosaur's skin was rotten.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about its life, including its canned intestine, to find out what it has eaten as its last meal.
They believe that when he died, the dinosaur got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where it sank on its back to the seabed.
By this time, Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans likely spread much farther inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with canned scaly skin but is also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the animal's original shape," Brown said.
'the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the early chalk period.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it; if you're just shielding a little with your eyes, you could almost believe he's at sleep. '
The chalk time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the Earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of its fearsome ancestors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-tonne monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta sank in the sea after death and was mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk as he grub at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the world's most bespoke armoured dinosaur, including skin and armor, and is complete from the snout to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 metres) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch long tips that raced from his shoulders.
Researchers believe the armored herbivore was swept through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilised remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy tank plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as' rare as a win in the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it gets.
Fossilized remains of the skin still cover the bumpy tank plates that carry the animal's skull.

In the thunderstorm: Mass carambolage on A8: Many injured
Thursday night's violent accident on the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carnage.
There are numerous injuries, miles of traffic jams - and gaffer.
About 20 people were injured in a mass carnage on the Stuttgart-Munich (A8) motorway late on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial police data, nearly 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, were intertwined at 5 p.m. between the junctions of Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm.
No information was available on the exact number of people injured.
They were minor to medium-serious injuries, a police spokesman said.
A large bid for rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.
A ten-kilometre backlog formed in the direction of Munich.
As an AZ reporter reports, there were also massive disabilities on the opposite carriageway - by numerous gaffers.
The fire service listed the registration plates of the vehicle's drivers, who now face sensitive penalties.
A second accident happened on the A8 shortly after 18: 45, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the scene of the accident.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "comfort check-in"
It's a moment almost everyone has experienced before: Nothing punishing you sit in the train and sleep.
Or you are deepened into his work and just have an ingenious thought.
And then: Pufff.
Comes the sheepdog and awakens one ungently or knocks the passenger in the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the creator-less ticketing control.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you are taking your seat and thus devaluing the ticket.
A test operation is currently underway on two routes.
"When the offer arrives, we extend it.
It is then expected to be available on many more long-distance routes in Germany early next year, "a rail spokesman said.
"Comfort Check-in" calls the train the ticket devaluation without Schaffner.
To be able to use them, however, some conditions need to be met: You need a smartphone or tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - which is what most passengers already do.
You must also have bought it through the train's app, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way to book tickets anyway.
And last but not least, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: You get on the train, call your ticket under "My Tickets."
A button for electronic devaluation will then appear with the test customers.
The train crews get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the train attendant comes to seat Y when it comes to ticket control, he knows there is a passenger sitting there with an already devalued online ticket.
So you can go on sleeping, keep working, keep silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: One for the customer, one for the train - which in turn is meant to benefit passengers.
"If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train crew, simply check in the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to make their travel time on the train more personal, "says Michael Peterson, DB Ferntraffic's marketing executive.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than they do today to respond to individual customer needs."
Those who often train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are among the biggest annoyances.
Because often you, but in any case one of your fellow travellers, do not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to show is missing.
The result is endless discussions between the train attendant and the passenger, leading to poor mood in the section or metropolitan area and delays in controlling their own ticket, and at the end of the day, the sheepdog takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other access numbers on the same route have not yet been unlocked.
As one activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just a day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis native sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled across a post from someone from high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the streets," it said.
Confused, as no one else on her feed had posted the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis area was in the process of live-tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's leaked body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put out her mobile phone to return to tweets about people on Canfield Drive later in the evening.
There were photos of the police tape and people screaming, and of a man claiming to be Brown's father carrying a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman uncovered his rifle and shouted, "I'm going to kill you... animals all."
"That's not common," Ferrell recalled of her statement.
'that's not the kind of murder we've become used to and that we can call typical. '
At that moment, I felt shaking.
I was angry and crying. '
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11pm, she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided the two would head to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary, "whose Streets?," in cinemas from 11.
It's a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a floral dress and a matching crown, the two discussed a conversation they had countless times before this morning "about the black experience and the black state."
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" She recalled of what she said.
'We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take them with me, "Ferrell said later.
'What's happened today is a culmination of... what happened in the past.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
It needs to be well developed, to know not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black Constitution, and what we need to do to become free to liberate ourselves.
Even though I am lucky enough to give her an experience where she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women's child.
I feel I would do her a disservice to keep her away from it. '
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a location opposite the police authority that became a campground as activists waited for Officer Darren Wilson's possible non-indictment.
There, Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to protesters.
Slowly, a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism totally changed after August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come. '
Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came to the mind of Ferrell: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story you can exploit?"
That skepticism was fed by countless cases of people, often whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in an interview recently, "We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson hadn't centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestract inmates.
His involvement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed by the team of "whose Streets?" In the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us, we talk," Davis said.
'that was the main thing for me, how these people are portrayed, because that's how I'm going to be portrayed. '
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement is "not a Messiah leader but a community that comes together," Folayan said - she proved to be the film's most open participant.
As a result, documents from "whose Streets?" Show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing when she first saw the finished product.
'But I understood that there has to be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people. '
What's more, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders, who shaped the film "BlacklivesMatter" on social media after the 2012 killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin, identify as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole," Ferrell said, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything. '
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really sustained by black women and many black women."
However, she insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action" where Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who stirred up that energy," she said.
'it's no accident, even though she was on the front line because there's so much at stake in a life at these intersections as a black, gay woman.
You can feel their energy through the screen. '
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but racial links between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years for blocking a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A mess."
Yet she clings to a vocalist and she feels committed to that memory ever since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains. '
Two extremes between which there is plenty of room for everyone.
"Not at the front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellows on the same benches, spread out in the room!"
"Very little space has remained owned by the city and we would like to see Extra Place continue to belong to the city," she said.
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it was repaving the small street and setting up seats intended, among other things, for a cafe the company would like to rent out space to.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face recognition system, this' receptionist 'can recognise how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their entertainment.
From "dream" to "megalomaniac": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, though it's far from built.
But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been dividing the population into advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold leaves the issue barely one.
The issue is also being discussed on our "Volksfreund Bitburg" Facebook page.
While some say to the bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be real class" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "Don't need a man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Megalomaniac!" (Lars Scholz).
While advocates are building for a gallery to attract more customers to the city, which also benefits the rest of the shops, opponents fear the pedestrian zone will then bleed out.
What's more, the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmers' market hall stands, where 13 direct marketing companies offer their products.
This will come to an end with the start of the construction work.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and to Beda Square with the opportunity to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying in the farmers" market hall almost every week for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women always very happy.
We also discovered the butcher for us.
We would like to see an opportunity to maintain this offer, even during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities, there is, too.
The small market hall in Frankfurt, in particular, is interesting. "
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketing companies settle in a market hall in the gallery comes down to the level of rent.
However, this is unlikely to be exactly low in the new project. "
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether it's clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets, I find that superfluous.
There are already enough of them in our city.
You can see how many retail stores are empty here - some for months and years.
However, as there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least maintain the market hall.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and, on top of that, are inexpensive.
As you can see, retail stores in a shopping centre are only rented by larger firms, because the rents there are often unsustainable for a retailer.
It's a shame, specialty shops almost no longer exist and what's left of it will probably disappear then. '
Wolf fandel: "A shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit together for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit in with Bitburg.
Above all, where should the farmers "market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the ghost bit gallery manage to drive all the shops out of Bitburg before? "
George Marquet: "That's just not going to work.
And a shopping center that stands empty, no one needs either.
In my view, it would have been better to promote a proper farmers' market, rather than this gallery.
But there is no place for a farmers "market hall, thanks to the insane many - I think - senseless construction projects in Bitburg.
If the farmers' market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again. '
A fitting resemblance: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptibly the same - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks tubers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former Secret Service analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after making public classified diplomatic messages through the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance (A matching resemblance).
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and groundbreaking dissident whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days left in his post.
Dewey-Hagborg has created a sharp, if somewhat intellectual, commentary not only on the formality of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity, through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and from which 30 portraits were created.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but has already spoken openly about identifying as a woman since her puberty, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison, her image was suppressed, so much so that there was only a single photo - a grainy, black and white selfie in which Manning clearly sits unwell on a driver's seat and wears a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came off the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette mugs and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of what these people might look like.
That was when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail, and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to do a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became uneven briefings, exchanging several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "suppressed Images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the president would transform Chelsea's judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would actually demand Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas just days after the book was released was a welcome kind of happy gathering.
There is also something deep and strong now at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is waging a war against whistleblowers from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further flout the rigid divisions he was supposed to fix.
When asked about the strange timing of all these things, Dewey-Hagborg said that "things happen for a certain reason."
In an artistic statement written on the gallery's wall, Manning, with her oversized signature below (the "i" in her family name is fitted with a heart), called for an end to "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall, her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil.
By incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's advanced scientific lexicon), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how remarkably similar, at least in biological terms, we all are.
"What people will hopefully take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data is to an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, spurious Memories, is also available.
'DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of those stories. '
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the comic novel mentioned above.
It shows Manning as she emerges from the United States' disciplinary barracks, such as King Kong, with a free-speech phone in her hand.
"If they cold your speech, then they won," it says.
'so never stop your mouth. '
"It came straight from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia.
'i still get goosebumps when I talk about it. '
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person - just as it was foreshadowed in the comic book - but if she was to do it, she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulacres, which clashed like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, right down to size (5 "2, Manning's stature), where her genetic haptic groups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
'i wanted it to feel like a mass movement forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind its liberation. '
University of Northwestern professor and an Oxford University employee wanted over killing
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee who are being sought as suspects after a man was stabbed with fatal injuries in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
On Monday, warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for murder over their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, the files from the Cook County District Attorney's Office show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several bullies.
A community warning system released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered July 27.
Officers received a call, arrived at Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the site of what happened, and detectives are investigating the bullies as murder while police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president of university relations, said in an email statement that Lathem was now in assessed and barred from entering the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal matter being investigated by the relevant authorities and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," Mr Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior Treasury assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an email statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to assist the US investigating authorities in any way we can."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to stand down.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to face the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are stepping up," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received an enigmatic tip that said something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear if the incident also took place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza's management team released a statement to residents: "Police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving something back to those who made sacrifices.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
Luc Chatel also defended education reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for Tuesday to protest the project, which they say falls victim to the educational training of future teachers.

"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it won't be long before the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for restoring the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) are implemented.
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, Rusada has been given the right to plan and test in collaboration with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard, "Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA's roadmap to comply with the code, which describes the criteria for re-establishing Rusada and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list notes that Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Referring to the matter, Mr Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation as our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake.
All the measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we're not going to admit something that doesn't exist. '
Mutko's words were in line with those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
Speaking to Russian outlet RSport at the start of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have said repeatedly that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one prefers to accept this report unconditionally, "Smirnov added.
Rusada was barred from carrying out doping checks in Russia in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal by WADA.
However, it has been allowed to plan and co-ordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
Speaking after a visit to the organisation's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA director general Olivier Niggli said Mr Rusada was "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.
In groups, new qualifications were acquired through the manufacture and sale of hand-made cards and subsequently visited other companies.
When entering the Expo 98 site, it is necessary to show a card issued only to workers who have demonstrated that they are legally resident in the country and are registered with the social security system.
"Optical cards" can be easily connected to all computers and combined with cards of a different kind.
Roland Fastberg will take over the second part as he designs the applications for the cards.
There are various cards on the market, and the important thing is that we are talking about machine-readable cards.
I have a functional card here and I will hold it up once.
You could also attach a magnetic stripe on the map and would then have combined all three types of machine-readable cards in one card.
For some applications it might be important that you can actually combine different technologies in one card today.
From time to time there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers offering two mattresses for the price of one.

"The price-quality ratio at the time angered me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive across the Czech Republic, district heating prices vary from city to city.
However, the price in Prague remains among the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewage charges are expected to rise by 7.4 per cent.
(Unless otherwise stated, all prices are of Toys "R" Us.)
Still, it foreshadows a slump in interest margins that banks are trying to balance with increases in fees and the prices of loans.
Even if he assumes that the war over liabilities - which penalizes interest-rate margins - will fade, the risk surcharges that banks and savings banks will have to pay for their emissions to preserve liquidity will already be passed on to the price of loans as compensation for dwindling profit margins.
"They'd like to go out, but they pay a lot of attention to prices," he insists.
The business will go well with those "who offer quality at good prices with a good service," he adds, reminding us that customers are saving in times of crisis, which is why prices are most in demand by €25.
'If you make a tender and there are few applicants, your prices will soar. '
"The thought, however, is that it is not the price that is crucial, but the expertise of the people," Laporte reiterated.
According to the higher price of the products, this is the second brake identified by the barometer.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
On Tuesday, in any case, the gap with German interest rates would have hit its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the bankruptcy risk had risen to 263 points, causing some helplessness in Rome.

Aldi is no longer selling eggs for now
This was shared by the business groups.
It was a pure precaution, and there could be no further risk of any health impairment, the notice said.
As of now, only eggs are likely to be delivered to Aldi, which has been shown to have been tested negative for fipronil-containing anti-lice.
As a result, Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency among its customers.
If we do not have an urgent debate, this matter will be followed by the end of the queue of motions for resolutions for the political committee, as happened with the resolution on Pakistan, which has not yet been discussed by this committee after three months.
Every minute of the working day, another five people are added to the queue, the one for unemployment benefits.
The fact that the fine-sounding concept of the common market does not mean much is demonstrated by the long queues at the EC's internal borders every day.
In the UK, this distribution took place in inhumane conditions, because pensioners had to queue as they did in the 1930s to get their free package of butter.
Logically, this causes inconvenience, as the queues of non-French travellers - quite contrary to the idea of "grandeur," which probably inspired the official who invented the system - are much longer than those of nationals of the Member State that owns the airport in question.
In addition, the veterinary service ensured that trucks carrying live animals or perishable food were processed outside the queue, that the animals were tweaked and provided with veterinary care and that the delays were kept as low as possible.
In fact, some are seriously hampered by blocked roads, and I myself was more than irritated when I had to wait in front of a military post in a long queue.
For example, voters standing in 1000-foot-long queues were sent back home in the evening because there was no electric light.
In terms of the number of Members of Parliament, I have long seen queues waiting to be able to use their card.

Part of a track that can be marked by longitudinal markings and the wide enough ¡st for a queue of motor vehicles, except motorcycles.
The implementation of these checks requires that drivers of commercial vehicles carry extensive documentation and wait in queues in front of customs offices until it is their turn.
There are 2,792 jobless workers on every vacant job in Sunderland, and more than half of the 1981 school leavers had not yet found work when the 1982 school leavers already joined the queue of jobseekers.
This last point may seem superfluous today, but so shortly after the "bad time" that continued into the fifties, every politician was all too present the empty shelves in the bakeries, the food cards and the long queues in front of the grocery stores.
In the UK, the practice is very different, that is, there are both really personal conversations and the so-called "cattle market," where teachers sit at tables in the school hall and parents queue to be able to change a few short, more or less meaningless words with the teacher in question.
If adequate content is in place, citizens would "prefer to work online" than queue, "Liikanen told CORDIS News.
By the end of 2000, on the other hand, the consumer who wanted to pay in euros often encountered cashiers who - not used to it - had to consult their superiors to handle the payment, while he himself drew the impatient views of the customers waiting in the queue.
Hence the snake.
The motto of 'eGovernment' could be 'to sit on the computer rather than queue', because eGovernment should, in fact, allow the simple handling of public services over the Internet, so that we no longer have to queue in the offices.
As a result, planes are often forced to fly a long detour to reach their destination or "queue" for the use of the corridors.
The EU-funded sculptor project opens up new avenues for visiting the major European galleries and museums so that endless queues and tired feet will soon be a thing of the past.
The handling procedures need to be streamlined and simplified so that long lorry queues no longer hamper border traffic between Kaliningrad and the neighbouring regions of Poland and Lithuania.
This leads to long queues forming on the winding coastal road leading into the town.
We are becoming increasingly aware of the loss of quality of life we suffer from traffic jams, waiting in queues and standing in front of closed stores, libraries and authorities.
The speech was not discussed with Obama, a meeting he had rejected with reference to the upcoming election in Israel.
And there are many reasons he would have to fight in a general election.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the election; however, that number is down from 78 percent last month.
She would do better if he didn't win the election, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's a good thing."
The start-ups that will help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure happiness at your e-commerce start-up with your employees, but the polls didn't work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.
"There's just never been consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.
She has called people from the outside for help.
A new breed of Human Resources start-ups is on the grow to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, provide anonymity and complaint hotlines to employees, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass C-suite executives and contact the board directly.
"They now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where's the Fitbit for your company?" Said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel over the three years with Glint.
In addition to snap polls and surveys from certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can rebounce why.
Companies are coming to terms with the need to stay at the forefront of workplace culture so you don't become the next Uber caught up in scandals ever since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could own more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial engineering website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw increasing interest and activity discredited earlier this year amid the Uber case.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send tailored "pulse" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behaviour.
And when the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the supervisory board.
"The court of public opinion has covered the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycotts, worker fluctuation and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company's headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope it was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track staff complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, problems previously hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair internships - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to that holistic, 360-degree view into the experience of employment," said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's Risk Management Group.
'and we're protecting our shareholders from employment litigation. '
Companies began taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed over ethical breaches caused by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took the "social media to get to their right" that companies realised you couldn't prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge companies with recurring fees for using their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity that will find the approval of Venture Capital investors who have backed both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from firms including Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising total capital to $47 million.
Glittering secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
These investments hardly come as a surprise, given the interconnected nature of business, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing body of research showing that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just stakes.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company that owns their voices, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well, and companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase engagement and employee engagement, it's no wonder you'll find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture important.
But the data is useless if a company's administrators fail to take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on its way.
And if change doesn't come quickly enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
"When you ask about 4,000 suggestions, you have to be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, which has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.
"Because if you don't follow, staff will ask," Have you really heard me?
Do you care about that?
And who you don't care about, why should I? '
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly staff surveys, was able to take action the same day a problem is reported about Glint, according to Errett.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated staff, through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize multiple teams within the company and add communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company keeps getting new insights about employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to better retention of workers in an industry known for high sales.
"If you're not required to create a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.
'and if you lose people, you lose customers too.
And if you lose customers, then you're going to lose businesses.

It was a very grey day; a matter of sky hitting full of snow clouds vaulted across the landscape; then and when fell some snowflakes that remained on the hard-frozen paths and bushes and trees without melting.

Behind and above the mountain's summit, the sky's bow spread, deep blue as it was at dawn; into the sky, the breast image of a woman, painted in such soft and indeterminate colours as it was only possible for me to put together.
A violent storm is blowing under this sky and above that mountain summit.
I love that day, I love this leftover sky; I love that calmness, that stillness, this solidification of the world in this frost.
In the kitchen, in the storehouse of the cellar, in the hall of the servants, in the grand entrance hall, the same life everywhere; in the salons was only peace and peace when the blue sky and the halcyonic sunshine of the splendid spring weather called the guests out into the park.
It was a warm, cylinder, but not a bright, hot summer evening; the meadow workers were busy all the way; the sky, though not cloudless, promised good weather for the coming days; its blossom - where it was visible at all - was mild, and the clouds moved high and transparent.
I don't know if it was a beautiful, clear or a stormy rainy day; as I walked down the big roadway, I didn't look up to the sky or down to earth; my eyes were at my heart, and both now gravitated to Mr. Rochester.
It seemed to say, "My magnificent visions are wonderful, but I must not forget that they are completely absent." In my brain I carry a rosy sky and a greenish, flowering Eden; but I know very well that here there is a rough path in front of my feet that I have to walk through, and that around me there are black thunderclouds that I have to defy.
But I looked neither to the sun, nor to the smiling sky, nor down to the awakening nature.
I looked up to the sky; he was clear; a friendly star sparkled just above the summit of the rock cliff.
Perfect beauty is a strong expression; but I do not take it back and do not justify it either; trains as sweet as the temperate climate of Albion only ever encapsulated them; colours as rosy red and lily white as they are ever produced and blown under this cloudy sky, in these humid winds, justify in this case the designation: Perfect beauty.
I stared at the bare wall; it seemed to me like a sky covered densely with shining stars - and every single one of the same signified to me a happiness, a joke, an act!
A fresh wind blew from the west; it came from the hills and brought with it sweet scents of heather and bins; cloudless blue in the sky; the stream swelled by frequent spring rain came brushing through the gorge, and bright, golden rays of the sun and sapphire-coloured ink of the firmament reflected on its surface.

He raised his hand and opened the eyelids, directed, as it seemed with great effort, up the view to the sky, then looked at the forest's amphitheatre - but for him it was all emptiness and darkness.
I led him out of the wild, damp forest to the sunny fields; I described to him how juicy green they were; how refreshed the flowers and hedges soared after the rain, how sparkling blue the sky was.
Even now, he is not yet able to see very clearly; he is not allowed to read or write much; but he finds the way without being led by the hand; the sky is no longer a colorless area for him, the earth is not an empty space.
"And just as I was looking for the highest tree in the forest," the dove continued with a raised voice, "and just as I thought I was finally getting rid of them, they even have to wind down from the sky!
About this, Alice laughed so loudly that she had to walk back into the pram, fearing they would like to hear her, and when she looked out again, the fish-painting continued, and the other sat on the floor at the door and looked foolish in the sky.
It wasn't quite complete; through the uncovered roof, you saw the grey sky.

And when we climb up to the cathedral without stopping at the thousand Barbarouses of all kinds, what did one start with the pretty little tower, which was based on the average point of the cross vault, and which was as slender and bold as its neighbor, the (equally destroyed) tower of the holy chapel, but higher, spitter, taller and richer than the towers, raging into the sky?
It was only here that this dome building appeared to be the boldest, freest, most artful and jagged tower ever to see the sky through its broken cone.
This is obvious and in view of our cold and rainy skies.
And by opening the window of the cell, he pointed the finger at the mighty Notre-Damekirche, which, at the increased sky, lifted the black outlines of its two towers, its stone surfaces and its mighty roof back, and resembled a monstrous, two-headed sphinx that had settled in the middle of the city.
Next to the bed was a window whose shattered stained-glass windows, which resembled a spider's net torn by rain, were seen through their broken roundings a piece of sky and the moon resting in the distance on a down cushion of delicate clouds.
In this passionate declaration of love, the gypsy sent a glimpse full of heavenly happiness to the dirty blanket that represented the sky here.

At his feet, some chickens picketed the pram, crawling the gold beetles in the sunshine; on the horizon, the tower of the Abbey of Sanct-Victor broke the hill line with its shale obelisk; and the windmill on the hill of Copeaux looked whipped as the working wings of his mill turned.
The sky was blazing and so was the water of the river.
Here only it was Claude who stood upright, and the obelisk which lay; but as the river that reflected the sky magnified the depths beneath him, the tremendous promontory seemed as boldly emboldened into the void as any coin tower, and the impression was the same.
The façade was wrapped in dark; in the background, the sky sparked in the star light.
The air was cold, clouds were rising in the sky, whose large, white waves poured one over the other as they crushed at the corners, depicting the ice age of a river in winter.
She slowly came up to him, raising the glances to the sky.
The air, the sky, the morning, the evening, the moon, my good friends the land strikers, the funny tributes with the girls, the beautiful monuments of Paris to study, three thick books to write, one of them against the bishop and his mills, and God knows what else?
Who do you owe it to you to breathe this air, to see this heaven, that you can still idolise your Lerchenkopf with truths and pods!
Above this flame one saw the monstrous towers with their two rising and digging fronts, one of which was dark, the other was illuminated in red, and which appeared even larger in the monstrous shadow they cast in the sky.

In the fog, the waters began to flow, the ice sheet barreled, and the plaice moved in; more quickly, the cloudy, foaming rivers poured in, and just on the Sunday after Easter against evening the fog broke, the dark vault dissolved into white lamb clouds, the sky cleared, and then the right spring erupted.
He stood and listened and soon looked down on the humid, moody earth, soon after the attentively horsing Laska, soon after the seas of bald tree-wielding that spread out in front of him at the foot of the hill, soon after the dark, covered by white clouds of clouds.
While they spoke like this, Laska splashed his ears, looked up to the sky and then threw a preposterous gaze at the two hunters.
She immediately pulled him into a conversation with the real French exuberance of kindness, primed him happy because he had such a very loving daughter, and downright brought Kitty to heaven by calling her, even though she was dabbling, a true treasure, a pearl, an angel of comfort.
He looked up to the sky while his Sense was waved.
I have only just looked up to the sky, and there was nothing in it than two white stripes.

The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It goes to 11pm as a crowd of UCLA footballers entertain on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have pulled out their jersey tops and show their backs full of sweat from the first day of training camp.
For a good part of the team, those idle minutes represent a lunch break.
Players enrolled to the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Waterman Football Center at 6: 30 the next morning.
"This is a real treble for the boys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA is eliminating two-day exercises to ease players' load, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the finals on Friday.
That's why UCLA's first three workouts should begin at 7: 15 p.m. to match players' already packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after last season and carried out practical exercises during the summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 exercises later this August, 20 before starting formal game preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA's rule change even if it adds another point to players' busy routes.
"We put this enormous burden on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
'and they just pushed it through, they move on, they're great people.
I think once we get to Saturday and we have more time, it's going to be really great. '
UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished, which will not be an easy task given the clear guidelines of its fields from an adjoining parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a high-class hotel already littered with footballs clearing a protective net behind a goalpost.
Bruins players are expected to fill the hotel from this weekend, but Mora conceded there could be a problem once those rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
'that's a real problem and it's not far-fetched to think people rent a room there and then set out there to record an exercise.
If you have the video tape of an exercise, it's a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking lot 8.
We're going to do the best, with what we have.
I am not too concerned about that.
We have a plan. '
He explained that it was "well possible" that Francis would ask the Cardinals for advice.

Community aid consists of food, medicines and blankets.
Medicines, staple foods, blankets and clothes are needed to improve people's terrible situation.
For three years now, the institutions have been content, first of all, with the Community and then the Union to count the points and the victims, to describe the devastation and to establish the displacements of the front lines and the displacement of the civilian population, and confine themselves to distributing food, blankets and medical supplies.
Oxfam (UK) ECU 1 250 000 (distribution of drinking water, blankets, kitchen utensils, hygiene products, shelters)
This aid, as far as I am aware, is being channelled in the usual way, mainly through non-governmental organisations, and in particular to the procurement of food, medicines, tents, blankets, water, sanitation and the like.

The quantitative data on textile tissues, which are shown in current metres in some countries and in other countries in gm, or the data on blankets given in some countries in pieces and in other countries in kg, make it impossible to evaluate company statistics for the internal market.

Facebook to step up facts review in fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to fact-checkers from third parties and then display their results under the original post, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday, one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false reports and send them to fact-checkers who may display results of fact-checking from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many believe has also affected the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to May's presidential elections, and Germany supports a plan to penalize social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hate-filled postings as they did before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review would be launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to recognizing which stories are challenged by fact-checkers from third parties, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook messages in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "related article" and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a comic novel: A castle in the history of England
In its recent past, the little Scotney Castle featured in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970 "s and 1980" s.
But Scotney has seen 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a fondness for historical documents.
"I think it's so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who's been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
'What a personal relationship to keep that letter in my hand. '
'a Castle in England 'spans the period from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward, documenting the families who lived in Scotney, each story illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It's not the first book by Rhodes to be based on an archive: He wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I just reacted to the thumb print on the side of a letter in a way that was written by a double agent in the 1700" s who worked for the Jakobians, "he says.
'that's his thumb print!
And letters always smell smoke, because at the time you lit a fire because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he were himself, too.
Oh, I love archives! '
For someone so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for nearly four months ("To be honest, I have a little overrated my welcome") this all seems too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, browsing the archives and studying the castle's many treasures and curiosities, such as the mounted hymen's heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He wandered through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscapers, gardeners and sometimes the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "whiskey and started writing."
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown as the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last heist, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees were just beginning to look after the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, throw it on the attic. "
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empires, maps depicting who owned what: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch that two families fought for.
Guys, let everything go his way! '
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a wider basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man leaving the newly built castle to join the farming uprising of 1381.
"There is a recording of a turmoil that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex,'" Rhodes says.
"The peasant uprising started in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected? '
Other stories are firmly rooted in the castle's history - such as' The Priest ', which tells the story of the Jesuit patron that the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', depicting 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney: "The Lords seemed quite crooks, always making debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking guys, with a talent to advertise Erwithin. "
After the end of his deployment at the castle, Rhodes is on the lookout for other unique writing experiences
He has had a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been recovered by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go back," he says.
It was like, 'Oh, now I have to deal with the damn life again.'

The young girl looked at him again, then she guessed as if a flame had risen to her cheeks; and while she took her tamburin under her arm, she progressed midway through the astonished spectators to the door of the house where Phöbus called her; slowly her step and fluctuating, her gaze disgusted, like that of a bird following the magic effect of a snake.
You could have compared him to a snake that pursued her.

After all, the steel is also directly interested in this development of the finished parts of the interior design, such as facade panels, internal partition walls, ceilings, undercover, roof covers, high-rise lockers and doors and windows.
How far the standard fire curve is reduced by this depends on the quality of the undercover and the ceiling above it.
At the building, fire protection of the interior supports was achieved by a flame retardant coating, with the ceilings trained as reinforced concrete composite covers.

We sometimes say that a glass ceiling prevents us from doing so.
There is a clear vertical separation of the sexes (the "glass ceiling") in the scientific disciplines in higher education.
These results show that considerations of how to encourage women to remain in scientific careers, as well as the existence of the "glass ceiling" in higher education, should be given greater prominence in politics than has been the case in the past.
Where precursors and primary packaging material, intermediates or bulkware are exposed to the environment, the interior surfaces (walls, floors, ceilings) should be smooth and free of cracks and fudges.
Ceilings and walls should be firm and have a smooth, impermeable and easily washable surface.

On the issues of unequal treatment of women and men in the labour market, including vertical segregation (glass ceiling), and the gender pay gap at the heart of the Community programmes referred to in Article 9 (2), the programme can be addressed in so far as it seeks to ensure an integrated approach to the various areas it covers or types of measures that are not financed by the programmes referred to in Article 9 (2).
He set the elevator in motion and was crushed by the cab on the ceiling of the elevator shaft.
The extension of equal opportunities to all members of society is a priority area for action for the period 2005-2010, including further measures to address various problems, such as the gender pay gap, the participation of women in the labour market, vocational training, overcoming the "glass ceiling," participation in decision-making and the reconciliation of work and private life for both women and men.
Gender differences in remuneration, greater participation of women in the labour market, the "glass ceiling," reconciliation of work and family life and participation in the decision-making process - these are just some of the gender equality issues where further progress is needed.
Figure 3.6 Porous materials can be used to dampen high-frequency sound on the walls of the work hall or hung on the ceiling as baffles.

The "glass ceiling" still ensures that few women rise to decision-making positions.
Add to that the so-called "glass ceiling" - the invisible barrier that keeps women away from the better-paid positions in management.
But while social policy still more or less encourages women's participation in the labour market, the business models - traditionally developed by men - form the pillars that ensure the so-called "glass ceiling" remains firmly anchored and impenetrable to women.

Department to clean up route for racetrack shuttle
Time and again, over the past few months, the future of the racetrack has been stripped - now it is to go very quickly.
It is expected to be built before the end of the year at the ailing track where the tourist track runs.
To secure the future of the racetrack in the long term, construction work on the track is expected to begin later this year, according to the Department for Transport.
"With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this link, which is particularly important for tourism," transport secretary Klaus Sühl said in Erfurt on Friday.
It estimated the cost of refurbishing the route at about €2.5 million.
Of that sum, the country takes 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle will continue to be ordered by the country, is currently being finalised, "Sühl said.
The ministry and the South Thuringia Railway as operators are already in agreement on the technical details.
"This will negotiate the road map, the vehicles used and the quality standards," Sühl said.
The proposed contract between the ministry and the rail company will be concluded for a duration of 11 years.
This should allow the racetrack shuttle to be ordered on a regular basis on December 2017.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a rail link, especially popular with tourists, between the railway stations of Ilmenau and Rennsteig.
In recent months, as part of a pilot operation, it has been tested whether the route will be used by a sufficient number of people to order it again in the future.
The route is also heavily dilapidated in parts.

It's proven that, despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.

"An inferiority complex that is almost inherent to Canadians may be much more likely to cause Canadian, political leaders to talk about internal issues of everyday life than to blame the United States in this election (as it did with the Free Trade Campaign in 1988)," he describes.

Madam President, there are new victims of ETA, but there are also new victims of Spanish oppression: New arrests, new torture, new transfers of prisoners imprisoned in the Basque country.
The first is the method; it is a powerless and opaque procedure which, in reality, borders the other institutions of the Union and in which governments fall victim to their own labyrinth.
Many victims are small children, awful impressions, terrible mutilations, the way of life destroyed before it has started properly.
We must ensure that those who have been innocent victims of the fight against crime - perhaps we should call this collateral damage - are not completely isolated from their loved ones in prisons.
But in the face of this crisis, we must guarantee both health and food safety for consumers and the income of livestock farmers, as well as the income of butchers, calf traders and wholesalers, all of whom have been victims of negligence on the part of national and Community authorities.
Appropriate measures must be taken to ensure the following rights for victims of crime: The right to receive and receive information; the guarantee of communication; participation in the procedure and access to free legal aid; adequate protection of the person and privacy; the right to criminal compensation and the possibility of dispute resolution through arbitration.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just when you thought it can't get any more crazy in 2017, comes a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yes, indeed.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, its shape of nipples and the type of fingernail.
"People are making fun of them, but companies are delivering plenty of them, and we're going to get to see them a lot more often," Mr. Sharkey said at the release of his new report.
Modern-day Sexpups have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customize" their robot according to their beliefs, selecting everything from the robot's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of its fingernails.
But it gets even more troubling as many robots possess the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern Sexpuppen have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the features they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that's adapted to your personality as much as possible," the True Companion website warms.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods during the day - quite like real people!
She can be tired, fixated on conversation or she can be "in the mood"! "
There are many troubling aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female traits, the allusions to rape when you take a step on frigid (called here: Reluctant) Farrah, worry one the most.
On its website, True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women can (sic) have a vibrator, then why can't men have Roxxxy?" The website says.
However, these sex robots aren't just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men, of course, will not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notes their rising popularity, they still remain provisionally on the brink of consumer culture.
But what leaks out of the fringe areas can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
And a lot of people aren't weird or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is, however, some overlap between these highly developed sex robots appearing at a time when women's rights are under threat around the world, where there is a president in the White House who has boasted of sexually assaulting women.
The most chilling aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') is not the graphic images, the treasured bodies and the extinct eyes, but how realistically this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this doesn't feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with porn star proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, that they emulate the movement of a real body.
But, to the point, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots don't represent real women.
They can't separate from their companion or just walk away.
They have no mediation or background story, nothing that hints at independence or anything that might upset the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are fake slaves.
Or to put it in the 2017 speech: Servicemen

Although they love Le Mans, the "green hell" of the Nürburgring-Nordschleife or Indianapolis, the Monaco GP course remains incomparable.

Only those who successfully complete a three-day course in the company's own training academy, in which he learns the correct handling and application of Semco, may also distribute this building material later.

A prize for me is, first and foremost, a great recognition, as is otherwise only given in research for important publications - with the difference that such an award, unlike a publication in professional circles, shows that one's own work is also perceived and appreciated by people who are not part of their own field of expertise.

It would then be possible, for example, to resolve disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farm-style kitchen of his kitchen, he starred like the million-dollar man of the world he has become.
The cost could hit JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, and that could mean there are fewer additional jobs.
Here is another task we will have to contend with for a long time, which is to let a person who is physically in a closed room believe he is in an open, virtually infinite space instead; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), moving platforms as well as large bullets.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters deserve more room, and they are far from alone in the film.
While there is a lift that runs midway through the mountain massif, the true space and reading pleasures tap into the footage of the topography.
"Normally the bookshelves stand along the facade, and in the middle is a large, dark room that is mostly unwieldy and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
However, there was a risk of him approaching physical and psychological harm because he was trapped in a tight space and unable to perform physical exercises outdoors.
They make significant personal sacrifices in the process and sometimes take great risks to their own physical safety and mental health.
The members of the Security Council expressed their appreciation to the ECOWAS countries for the enormous sacrifices they have made and for their contribution to the cause of peace and stability in Sierra Leone and called on the members of ECOWAS to continue to support the peace-keeping efforts in Sierra Leone.
Their sacrifice will not be in vain.
This time, we debated with director Alena (not a single man takes part in the course) how to attract a woman who doesn't have an ideally proportioned figure.
The course will be developed and offered by interested governments, international organisations and institutions with the necessary expertise and facilities.
As the example of the peacekeeping forces recently returned to Haiti teaches us, the United Nations must stay on course if the fragile peace that prevails at the start of a peace mission is to be consolidated and irreversible.
This action plan builds on the progress made over the past 60 years in the field of human rights and sets a course to strengthen the OHCHR in such a way that it can meet the imperative requirements of human rights in today's world.
Even where the course to be taken is clear, nothing will happen if there are significant capacity deficits - so if there is a shortage of human, financial or other resources.
It encourages the new government to pursue the course of stability and national reconciliation and to promote social inclusion.
Bearing in mind the experience in Haiti, the Central African Republic, Guinea-Bissau and Timor-Leste, I urge the Member States not to prematurely end the course towards peace and UN peacekeeping missions.
The Security Council therefore praises the course pursued by the democratically elected Government of Lebanon and the Lebanese Armed Forces in exercising their respective responsibilities in the period leading up to the holding of the presidential election.
Trump's big accomplishment?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. electorate have also divided small-format families.
Around Christmas and harvest festival, there were newspapers in the United States with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-voting relatives.
We are all reportedly making an effort to burst our filter bubbles.
Less noticed has been the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and has long worked with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.
It reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship she had struggled with for decades because of politics, is suddenly and quite peculiarly on the same page.
This is certainly a good thing around the dinner table, but it strikes me in another context that this also carries significant risks.
The left has been bolstered by Trump, but the daunting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the grisly possibility that one day his mates won't kick us off.
There is, however, an even more terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who suddenly appear as the epitome of sensible at once compared to his standards.
I find myself nowadays tainted by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomic version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which are, in fact, a very mild crime compared to Trump.
If Trump goes, the next Republican nominee just needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York park department's carousel, and the best $3 you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are hugely large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are growling and the animals twisting to look over their own shoulders full of fear - extremely sinister and the climate-changing music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: The views of tall buildings get old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city doesn't live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite across the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn't count - but a large roundabout in north London.
However, the Central Park carousel is still a strangely magical experience as here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women can go on it in the 40's and all have a great time.
If I could have assessed the carousel I would have given him the full score but luckily no one asked for it.
On the other hand, in a department store this week, I was forced to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could get through my credit card.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street, it's the same, plus the option of matching the valuation with a 15 per cent tip - this to buy something over the charge table.
This not only leads to a slowing down of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the department store stood excitedly grinning while I tired of the experience of handing her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pains
Pistorius has left prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year, he was taken to hospital for treatment of cuts to his wrist, which he said the prison authorities suffered after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cubicle at his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a night intruder who hid in the cab.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Law Enforcement Agency said it would appeal to the South Africa Supreme Court and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk of his sentence being increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he undercut women's contacts with the outside world.
The world price of crude oil rose 52 percent this year - last month, the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly $100.
In the Budair trade triangle, the price of the usual "Napi" Christmas basket has also increased by 16 percent this year, but price increases of over 1,000 HUF have been registered in all hypermarkets.
With prices in grocery markets "davongalopped" last December, inflation has not been slashed in percentage terms, compared with the already high, earlier baseline level.
The prices of unicum and live fish remained close to the previous year's level, but the prices of turkey-bruised fillets, nuts and poppies have risen sharply.
Prices for flour and bread were in line with data from the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but at Auchan there were 1kg of bread rolls for 139 forints.
Also surprising here was the price of a two litre Coca-Cola deposit bottle of less than 200 forints, so the drink, including a pledge, cost only 257 HUF.
Our calculations revealed that Cora increased prices in the "Napi" shopping basket by 15 compared with Christmas prices last year, while Tesco and Auchan each increased by 18 per cent.
There has been a catastrophic price increase compared to the last two Christmas seasons, and the price of daily consumer items in the hypermarkets has increased by more than 30 per cent in less than 20 months.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three warehouses don't even look at prices.
The price of this car is not exactly folk.
What still seems uncertain is the extent to which we can actually operate on the market, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at customer level.
Insurance companies set their prices in line with the statistics, so that if there is a higher risk of accidents, higher contributions will also be due.
The cautious drivers can select a full casco with self-participation, so that while the benefits of a full-rate insurance are covered, they are offered at a low price.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge higher transit fees from Russia.
As a result, this led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, which dramatically pushed up prices.
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
Overall, prices rose 3.0 percent year-on-year.
The draft is expected to be submitted to the General Assembly for adoption during the Millennium Summit, and leaders are invited to solemnly mark the first ever convention against cross-border organised crime at a special signing ceremony hosted by the Italian government in Palermo in December, together with the United Nations.

Following the adoption of the United Nations Millennium Declaration, the President of the General Assembly has made it his mission to revitalise the work of the Assembly in order to reduce its burden of the increasing overburdening of the agenda over the years.
If the adoption of an amendment inevitably means the rejection of another, the latter will not be put to the vote.
9. notes with gratitude and satisfaction that, in accordance with the call in paragraph 7 of Resolution 55 / 158 of the General Assembly, a number of States have become parties to the relevant agreements and protocols referred to therein, in order to achieve the objective of broader adoption and implementation of these agreements;

Articles 1.2 j), k) and l) of the Staff Regulations contain the basic rules governing the issue of the acceptance of badges, orders, benefits, gifts or contributions from bodies outside the organisation (see Code of Conduct of 2001, paragraphs 46 and 47).
The old Article 1.6 regulated this issue in a rule that banned the adoption of any benefits from a government and severely restricted the adoption of benefits from non-government agencies.
With the text of Article 1.2 (j) he proposed, the Secretary-General wanted to express his view that the General Assembly should stress the importance of the impression of the strict independence and impartiality of staff, and thus reaffirm the absolute prohibition on the adoption of benefits by governments.
The Secretary-General will inform all Member States in writing of this principle of organisation on the issue of the acceptance of badges of honour, orders, benefits, gifts or grants in order to avoid such incidents where possible.
This consent will only be granted in exceptional cases and only if the adoption is not incompatible with the interests of the organisation and with the position of the staff as an international official.
In accepting such gifts, there should be little risk of undermining the integrity or independence of staff.
In accordance with provision 101.2 m) of the Staff Regulations, the Secretary-General may exceptionally authorise an employee to accept, from a non-governmental body, honorary marks, orders, benefits, gifts or grants that are not covered in provision 101.2 j) to l), provided that their adoption is in the interests of the United Nations and is not incompatible with the position of the employee.

I welcomed the resumption of inspections by the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) in Iraq in November 2002 following the unanimous adoption of Security Council Resolution 1441 (2002).
When farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberger schools, the fourth-graders were sacked from fuses and apple hoops into the holidays and secondary schools.
Three of the graduate students will go to high school in the future, four to the realtor.
Head teacher Angelika Sitte greeted the public's parents and representatives at the Biesental Civic House in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of school dismissal, the 29 students from the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle who grows up in the chicken farm but is then released to freedom.
To do so, the mundane char performed a musical called "The eagle in the chicken farm."
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and left it out of his chickens.
Instead of a chicken, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken out of it was smashed, the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and escaped.
After that, grades three and four showed a chicken dance in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young goggles wearing cylinders to make the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said head teacher Angelika Sitte.
The juvenile, while different from the other juveniles (chicks), is one of them.
However, he will never be like a chicken.
His determination is to be free.
She wanted every four-year-old to feel accepted in his new school.
It was followed by a word of thanks to the colleagues, the former head of the school, Michael Müller, who keeps jumping at lessons, and the parents' representatives.
The kitchen season is now over, classroom teacher Sophia Schumacher explained.
She was very reluctant to release her students after two years of lessons, because it was a really great time.
Finally, she was able to rely on the fourth-graders.
Finally, all the students left a song of summertime and holiday season.
There was a great deal of joy among the children.
Eight first-time buyers are already registered for the new school year.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal campings in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, citing television, said.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of people were arrested by the police in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day while an investigation is ongoing.
The Foreign Ministry reported to BTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control of free camping and are imposing substantial fines on anyone found to remain in a place not intended for that purpose.
Inspections will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court can impose a fine.
First, because some young people don't use the benefits of these cheap cards anyway, as they wouldn't listen to classical music at any price.
But Bayern, undefeated in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next casualty.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered as 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collapsed on Mecca's Grand Mosque.
The victim suffered a nose burst and was bleeding heavily from his nose.
When his two friends rushed and appealed to the thug, he initially let go of his victim.
A 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate who has been missing since Saturday has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The final victim of this barbed was a straight-starting affair that had been more promising for alleviating the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and might even have brought him some satisfaction.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now a part of my past.
Liberia has been hit hardest by the virus, and more than 600 people fell victim to the fever here alone.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What those affected need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers need to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and, in some cases, Euro 6.
Euro 4 diesel or worse are exempt.
Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the software updates negotiated are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have cheating software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofitting has been ordered by the Federal Railroad Administration (KBA).
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced a speedy implementation over the next few months but have not yet given an exact date.
Daimler has been told to write to anyone affected.
If an inspection is due anyway, it will be done within their framework.
How long are the overall installments likely to drag on?
"Hard to say," Smetanin says.
This depends on the commitment of manufacturers and political pressure.
"Because we have seen that, so far, car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily when it comes to the environment."
How long should the update last?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It can be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who don't drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
Presumably foreign manufacturers would follow suit, according to Smetanin.
Is there now a risk of a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars?
ACE fears this.
But it is precisely in the regions where driving bans are at risk.
In rural areas, there have so far been no losses in value for older diesel.
The ACE advises that with a sale still to be seen.
Despite advances in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it.
Given that the Egyptian people are being given an ultimatum by resorting to a rushed vote: "Either vote for my draft or I retain the unlimited power of attorney," the latter should supposedly end once the Constitution is adopted.
Petrizki also lived with him in the camp.
Every few hours they took a bath, so it was high afternoon when they returned to the camp.
Everything in the camp was soaked, the fire extinguished; for they were reckless herdsmen, like all unparalleled, and had not taken precautions against the rain.
All means of getting hot and tired were applied conscientiously, and gradually all the expatriates poured back to the camp, equipped with tepid hunger and then the destruction of the good things began.
Ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
The Kennedy Awards gala is one of the most glamorous events in the Washington.
The first awards show under President Trump promises to be political.
One of the winners doesn't want to come - in protest.
Ll Cool J (49) is the first rapper to get one of the prestigious Kennedy Center's coveted awards.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are also among the scholars this year.
The awards will be handed out in early December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the ceremony along with his wife, Melania.
For this reason, the winner, Lear, who has been announced with progressive TV series, has already announced that he will not take part in the gala.
He told the New York Times: "This presidency has chosen to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even deprive them of the funds - and that puts a strain on me."
The 59-year-old Estefan insisted she would use the conversation with Trump to clear her view.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Previous winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
Our politicians don't understand enough about science, and they rarely pick the advice of scientists and engineers when it comes to solving important problems.
Larger U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintain close ties with Iraq's oil ministry and have been on hand with technical advice in recent years, have gone out of business.
This year she is a candidate for Chile's National Prize for Literature, an award given by the government, the Department of Education and the National Council for Arts and Culture.
He is one of 16,000 Egyptians convicted by military courts since the Higher Council of the Armed Forces became the de facto ruler of Egypt.
For a year now, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), the Egyptian military council, has been abusing Egyptian women, in a despicable though not irreparable way, sexually, physically and psychologically.
The government was forced to set up a council to write a new constitution: A group of citizens - without politicians, lawyers or university professors - who made the discussion process accessible to all and managed to work out a preliminary proposal by consensus.
In any case, we can now begin to analyse the list of candidates, draw some conclusions on them and also make forecasts as to who will get a seat in the Council.
At the present time, there are 142 registered candidates for the council's 45 seats.
Although there has always been a gender imbalance in the protest movement, the list of candidates for the Council reaches a new level of imbalance.
While some opponents criticized the voting process and the results, many (if not most) members of the protest movement have hailed the council as a triumph of cooperation and mobilization.
In the near and distant future, the Council will certainly still frequently take a position on similarly volatile issues.

We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city builder, is retiring next year.
The vacancy has already been advertised - but suitable candidates are rare.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And the work is still great fun for him, as he conveys in the press section.
He reports on varied but also demanding tasks that await his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that so far no application meets the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible date.
In this way, in compliance with the regular notice periods, there will still be enough time for a review.
Since Haslach acts as a subcontracting authority for the administrative community, the applicant must have the relevant qualifications.
Because that function is definitely what the city wants to keep.
If it could no longer fill them, citizens would have to travel all the way to Offenburg for advice.
But proximity to the people is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports on a good working climate as well as good mood between the authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some significant projects have accumulated that Wacker looks back on with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure about the building office and its employees.
But there are also varied projects on the agenda in the future: The transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen parking lot, for example, have been initiated.
The kinky bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and stadium rehabilitation is still an issue.
The latter alone will cost around €1.5 million "if we get it right," Wacker estimates.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun. '
In terms of design, there is a great deal of room for a city builder.
With Haslach's own yard and gardening, many things can be responded to quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," Mr Wacker said, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.
As the Old Town is under preservation as an ensemble, it is important to "keep an eye out for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city builder insists.
Anyway, the city builder bears a heavy responsibility.
He's a builder, "in the end, everything here runs over my table."
When it comes to support and coordination, he can count on many years of staff: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been here for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) for 15 years.
Also, that his successor remains long, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place."
Because continuity is important not only for a good working climate, but also for the further design of the city.
According to the city of Haslach, those who wish to inherit Roland Wacker should have a completed degree as a diploma engineer or bachelor with a degree in architecture and have good technical knowledge in the fields of building planning and planning law.
The Stadtbauamt is under the supervision of civil engineering, civil engineering, property management, the management of the municipal properties, the Municipal Court with a yard and city gardening, as well as the Lower Building Authority, including the Protection of Monuments.

Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help ease IBD (inflammatory intestinal disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims just the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are normally advised to avoid meat and dairy products to ease their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The senior researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestines patrol to ensure harmful microbes hiding in food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
If the balance tends too far toward inflammation, it can result in inflammatory intestinal disease.
Experiments found that a type of tolerance-boosting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: 'We have established a link between a type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. '
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan encourages more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus if the same system also boosts in humans.
The postdoctoral student, Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan, examined a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, but which was housed separately, did not.
She suspected the difference had to do with the mice's intestinal microbioms - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mice's diets were DNA sequenced and six types of bacteria were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells but were missing from the mice without them.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment so they lacked a bowel microbiome and they didn't develop these kinds of immune cells, and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells evolved into the tolerance-boosting cells.
When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as Indol-3 lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's lining, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-boosting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known if tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as they do in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory intestinal disease.
She said: 'The development of these cells is probably something we would like to encourage as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed a 'genius' with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, a "genius" has signed with Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Chelsea's £40million signing began with a 2-1 win in Dublin, the final pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched at will.
However, Matic was ruled out of the Blues' preparation Asia tour and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
'We'll help him get ready sooner rather than later. '
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also starred at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho formed his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted the club had already done a "fantastic job" of meeting three of its four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, I thank the club for that," he added.
'i'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've made a big effort. '

New low for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem
As the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader, Social Democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections.
Just no troublemakers from the party headquarters, just no headwinds from the federal government - such was the most important wish of the campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz leads the party, that has fundamentally changed.
Since then, the staff from the Willy Brandt House have been watching events in the SPD-ruled state capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with headwinds.
It was lows.
And one by one.
The federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and Greens following the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony.
"This shows once again that red-green simply cannot govern reliably," CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber told the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprise group exit of a Green MP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the state election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
The Greens federal executive, Michael Kellner, has called on the breakaway low-profile Green MP Elke Tested to return her mandate.
The transfer to the CDU means a clear distortion of the will of the electorate.
Elke Tested must immediately return her mandate, "the Greens' federal executive and campaign manager told the editorial network Germany (RND).
"All of this must not be true at all," sighs one SPD campaigner as the new obscurity reaches party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD prime minister of Lower Saxony, is without his own government majority following the transfer of Green MP Elke Tested to the CDU.
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD national associations.
And no one knows what's coming next.
The plight began with the unexpectedly significant defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, more not, the comrades calmed down at the time.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
That was then - and it all became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into defiance, and the Dusseldorf bust hauled the party smoothly.
Painstakingly, the comrades rappelled again in the weeks afterward.
Then, when they had just gained new courage, came the G-20 summit in Hamburg.
And with it came the next low.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD country chief, lost his Nimbus that weekend for sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned.
And because he did pretty much everything wrong in crisis communication after that that can be done wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now also Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW emissions scandal and his role on the supervisory board, the low-profile prime minister has been under criticism for quite some time.
Middling poll numbers were added.
Still, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil has been trying more and more to accent in the federal government in recent weeks.
The desire of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin was also not hidden from comrades in the surroundings of Martin Schulz.
They allowed him to be granted, as they promised to stabilize the party from Weil.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
In doing so, Weil is basically not to blame for the partisan coercion of the Lower Saxon Greens.
And Schulz certainly didn't.
For the time being, the comrades are therefore trying to keep their own ranks closed.
Their anger is directed at the Greens, and here, in particular, the breakaway parliamentarian, Tvests.
"It is intolerable and democratizing how Ms. Tuttle puts her own career interests above everyone else's interests," Matthias Miersch, head of party leftists in the SPD parliamentary group, tells the editorial network Germany (RND).
Ms Tested has been elected to parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate but through the national list of the Lower Saxony Greens, according to the low-profile MP.
The logical consequence would be for it to return its mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, leader of the SPD parliamentary group, laments an "undemocratic manoeuvre."
"The voter fervor four years ago was clear: People made Stephan Weil prime minister," Oppermann, who leads the low-profile SPD as the leader in the federal election, tells the RND.
"Now the personal career memory of a future CDU MP distorts the outcome of the election," Oppermann continued.
He called for the background to be investigated.
I want to know whether there has been more or there have been further commitments from the CDU of Lower Saxony.

I believed I had grasped the full extent of her love when she surprised me and told me: "After seven months in prison and the torture I had to suffer, during which I only thought of him and my children; when I was sacked without taking any advice from anyone, I searched the air force's headquarters in Damascus in secret."
The federation is then available with legal advice, making the case known to the public via social media and documenting it.
Mira Rai has a valuable advice for her:
Yasin Al Haj Saleh is surrounded by friends who seek his advice when they feel tired and exhausted.
I didn't even know about the ground rules of public relations and therefore asked him for advice on every little thing.
Viewers were already celebrating themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and the lightning table on the video wall depicting their club as a class prim.
In heaven, he will be proud that on Earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can rightly claim that it can be found in people's pockets as much as above their heads in the sky: It knows where people have spent their holidays, what specialist doctors they go to, and what moves them.

If, in a given year, one of the above-mentioned ACP countries is not in a position to supply the total amount set and does not wish to benefit from the measures set out in the following paragraph, the Commission may allocate the missing quantity in the annual total to the other ACP countries for which the scheme applies.
The third paragraph regulates the application by the Commission.
However, the more important provision of Article 109j is contained in paragraph four:
It is based on a passage in the festive declaration of the European Council in Stuttgart in June 1983 (paragraph 2.3.7. last paragraph):
At the end of the presentation, the following paragraph should be added:
However, paragraph 2 has a third paragraph with the following wording:
What does this third paragraph say?
The last paragraph of the amendment suggests that the work should be carried out mainly through research contracts and in part by the Commission's Biology Group in Ispra at the Joint Research Centre.
I would therefore ask you, Mr President, to put the first paragraph to the vote separately from the rest of the text.
Rules of procedure Article 14, paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 6 These paragraphs are to be replaced by the following single paragraph:
The explanations are to be changed by adding the following paragraph:
The amendment to this paragraph writes hot water showers during working hours
The explanatory statement on page 8 states in the very last paragraph:
So either a single amendment will replace everything - and that was the procedure so far - or it will be voted on individually on each paragraph.
However, it will amend this paragraph in such a way as to make it clear that the tariffs must cover the airline's direct operating costs on the route concerned and that state aid granted under Article 93 of the Treaty may be deducted from the cost of the airline.
I would ask the Commissioner to confirm to us that the Commission intends to carry out the investigation mentioned in the second paragraph.
That is why I ask all those present to pay attention to the last paragraph of this motion for a resolution, in which we recommend a joint study, mainly by the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on Development, of all the new aspects that arise in the sugar sector from the introduction of new techniques and products.
The last paragraph of Article 3 only takes up the right of initiative conferred on the Commission by the Treaties.
There is a paragraph in this agreement which says that the Council of Ministers should agree to plug the budget hole in 1984 and 1985.
As regards respect for human rights in the Community, the Council recalls that, in ratifying the Treaties establishing the European Communities, the Member States approved the following paragraph of the preamble:
It attaches far too much importance to a subcommittee of the Senate, which actually has no power, and does not sufficiently deepen the issue in the other paragraph.
The French version lacked the expression 'from the European Parliament', thereby losing all meaning to the paragraph which has been discussed in great detail in the Committee on Development and Cooperation.
A paragraph in the resolution tabled by Mr Herman and his party friends, on the other hand, requires a comment on our part: We are astonished that the Commission's proposals are considered only in the short term.
We voted on the first paragraph of Article 102 (a) but, as far as I recall, we effectively did not vote on the second paragraph.
It is clear that the House has adopted the first paragraph.
Then this paragraph was voted out by a majority of the committee.
An amendment I tabled and adopted by the majority of the House is recorded as rejected in the Minutes and, finally, the recital of the original resolution was miraculously turned into a first paragraph of the main part.
In paragraph III of the last paragraph on the Committee on Budgets, the German text again contains the wrong translation.
In this paragraph it is forgotten that the Baltic countries are currently part of the Soviet Federation, that their authorities and their peoples know this well, just as they also know that the rhythm of the reforms depends on that of democratisation in the USSR.
I refer here to Article 14, second paragraph.
However, when we analyse this article, we note that, according to its first paragraph, the Member States are endeavouring to promote the improvement of the working environment in particular.
Due to a misunderstanding, 16 members of my group voted against this paragraph and two abstained.
It is clear to me, however, that this would have had no bearing on the final outcome, since the paragraph was rejected by a majority of 55 votes.
Can the Commission indicate whether it has submitted a report on the progress made in ensuring social protection in accordance with the first paragraph of Recommendation 85 / 308 / EEC (x) on the social protection of voluntary aid workers?
You are no doubt aware that the first paragraph of Article 146 of the EEC Treaty in today's version reads: 'The Council is made up of representatives of the Member States.
Firstly, will the Commission accept this amendment, which is to abolish the second paragraph of Article 6?
Because, Mr President, in every paragraph it mentions the issues of the Kurdish issue, the Cyprus problem, torture, freedom of the press and trade union freedoms in Turkey, and this means that there are problems.
Secondly, it is true that the first paragraph of Article J4 of the Maastricht Treaty reads: 'The common foreign and security policy covers all matters concerning the security of the European Union, including, in the longer term, the definition of a common defence policy which could lead to a common defence in due course'.
That is why I now hope that the Commissioner will consult with his colleagues over Christmas and ask them to come forward to my paragraph in the resolution in the new year.
This week started well in the European Parliament, when we discussed, among other things, the Barzanti report, in which the following paragraph summarises the opinion of many Members of Parliament.
That was in the paragraph.
However, if we look at Part II of the Minutes, we see that point 1 is de facto a decision consisting of three recitals and a reasoned paragraph.
Funding for the town centre III
If you want to clean up your year-old house, you can soon get support from the country.
This was informed by Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG urban development in sensitivities on Wednesday.
At the start of the briefing, Schindler gave a look back at what has happened so far.
Since 1991, there have been remedial areas in sensibilities.
At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two-thirds of the funding.
In remedial area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60 percent, after all.
For Schindler, the renovations so far are a "success project" - it is important, after all, to promote interior development as well, and not just tap into new building areas.
On 4 April, the Board of Governors of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III.
The funding amount was €833 333, of which €500,000 would come from the country, the rest from the community sensibilities.
How will a rehabilitation area be created?
One will, Schindler continued, investigate where the "really old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role in whether there is any interest in sanitising in the planned area.
If necessary, the territorial borders could then be moved again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday night.
Keller presented the contents of the federal government's "Social City" program, under which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out object-related, that is, per property.
The rehabilitation area would then eventually be laid down as a statute.
The grant period for the funding has been running since January 1, 2017, until April 30, 2026.
However, by September this year, the stocktaking would be carried out, in which those involved in the recovery area would be given a questionnaire to fill out.
The sentence decision is to be made as soon as possible in November or December so that the renovations can begin next year.
Pietzschmann subsequently stated that each commune had to carry out the said pre-trial investigations.
It is about assessing urban grievances and deciding when to rehabilitate and to what extent.
A remediation note will then be entered in the land register for the respective property.
Pietzschmann will come back to sensibilities himself and get a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of stakeholders.
That's why there will be questionnaires that will be posted to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land arch," which covers, among other things, the structural condition and the renovation intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and housing arch," information on the size, division and residents of a living room can be made.
The blue "operating sheet" can only be filled out if premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new building measures are not eligible.
Schindler still stressed that the distribution of funding works according to the "greyhound principle" - those who come first are cautioned first.
You can't "reserve" funding for later.
Finally, photos of the "town centre II" project were still being shown to make a refurbishment "palatable" to those in attendance.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to get into house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be fitted with a microchip so he can open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had the tiny chip implanted between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals looking to simplify their lives using technology through his company, BioTeq.
He has joined Dr Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure the implant procedure is performed by medical standard.
The technology resembles a cat and dogs implanted microchip and takes just 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's firm would also like to change the locks on houses and cars so they are compatible with the chip, all for an extra cost of £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now fitted technology both at home and at his BMW Z4, which begins when his hand is at the wheel.

The White House's advertising costs cost taxpayers thousands
The White House's decision to fly a navy helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military's data left to TIME magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was the centrepiece of the July 17 White House event featuring American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was issued next to a yacht from Maine, a firefighter's car from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House military office required the helicopter's presence in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," the commander of the HMX-1 wrote to his superiors, the deputy naval commander for aviation, on the eve of the event.
The news showed the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn about 7am on July 17 for the event at 3pm, and remained until the lawn was cleared between 6pm and 9pm this evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was to be delayed, a second team would be needed for the return flight due to the restriction on service hours.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained on the plane while on the ground.
The records provided to TIME did not specify whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could breach the provision.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the hatch act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're closed," the deputy commander replied.
The Made in America event was designated an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave a push for health-care reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations.
Using the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for the trip.
But to request their use only for a photo op is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane provided taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential plane.
"The White House is excited about the" Made In America "show - which shows products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials," said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews frequently conduct training flights in the area around Washington and the South Lawn to dismiss the U.S. president at the White House with precise centimetres.
When Trump was in Germany at the G20 summit in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight for the Made in America event counted in the flight crew's training needs for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said taxpayers did not take the burden on any of the other props unveiled at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to hourly rates from the U.S. Department of Defense for the 2017 financial year, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Records from the unit record the plane's flight time as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
"Setting the cost to taxpayers based on the estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," Mr Walters said.
'These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds. '
According to a 2015 RAND study, reimbursement rates for DoD do not include staffing costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contracting.
At that time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present things this week that are made in America," Spicer said.
'and I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I expect hundreds, if not thousands, of people to depend on it.
And I think like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly for.
It's appropriate, of course, to highlight that. '
It wasn't clear if Trump interacted with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he put himself in the driver's seat of a firefighter's car.
At the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of them."

How America can harm OMV
Donald Trump was not really happy when he put his signature under the law to tighten sanctions on Russia Wednesday night.
"In its haste to enact the law," Congress wrapped up a few "unconstitutional regulations," he corroborated.
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels foisted the U.S. push.
After all, the draft provides for punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Investors from the domestic OMV, which is co-financing the construction of the Russian Baltic pipeline Nord Stream 2, together with other European companies, have since been similarly troubled.
The drop-off is huge.
Still, it is too soon to estimate the consequences, according to the oil company's official statement.

Narcos season 3 trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will take center stage in Netflix's hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos unveiling Pablo Escobar's killer, Netflix's series is far from over.
Seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first receiving its first trailer and showing off the show's latest villains.
With the third season, the DEA has turned its attention to the world's richest organization of drug trafficking: The Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful puns, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more government bribery and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican compound, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement officials to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.

Role backwards: The city is providing 46 kitchen aids
The city reorganizes the Kita luncheon itself.
With permanent contact for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the urban nurseries.
As of 1 September, the city of Krefeld is again taking over the food supply in the urban nursery facilities (kitchens) in its own right.
For Sonja Pommeranz, deputy director in the Department of Youth Aid, this is good news: "We were all very pleased."
Cooked continues to be out of the house: A caterer takes on this task and delivers fresh gekochtes chilled.
The city runs 46 nurseries in the Krefeld area, and in 44 the children get a warm meal at lunchtime.
Last year, 2800 children each sat at the tables, and the need is growing steadily.
"Meanwhile, not only children who are cared for 45 hours of the week are eating lunch at the Kita," explains Pommeranz.
'the offer also applies to 35-hour care when children stay until 2pm. '
46 part-time workers have kitchen service from September 1: They heat the food delivered, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, portioning the meal individually, giving out the food, clearing, rinsing and cleaning the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a Kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - determines the hourly circumference.
"The kitchen helpers are now firmly part of the Kita team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
'so they're much more involved and it's easier for the citaly to implement educational concepts. '
Because that's what it's all about: Healthy eating and cooking lessons.
'the children should help prepare the food. '
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
For the children, too.
'They have a well-known force in the Kita, a person familiar to them, and not constantly changing people. '
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by specialist cleaning staff in the future.
In addition to improving the quality of the kitchen's performance, this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm it has turned out to be the most economical in the cost comparison between self-rule and foreign allocation for the city, the Press Office says.
And that's despite 46 part-time workers being rehired.
"But those hours don't even drop as much with around 750 people in the educational sector," says Sonja Pommeranz.
In addition, like a number of other project critics, he fears that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant: "There must be whole busloads coming to make that count," Mr Schulz said.
Shoes with a running sole made of hemp straps, whose surface is 57% at the top, under the bale and under the paragraph with rubber reinforcement, are to be assigned as shoes with a rubber sole of the Common Customs Tariff number 64.02, with regard to the material of their upper part, the letter of this tariff number.
Moreover, the fact that the textile material remains visible around the leather and in the paragraph cannot exclude its classification as fodder.
Thirdly, the textile material visible around the leather and the paragraph appears to ensure that the shoe is more comfortable to wear.

Afghan democracy depends on women's political role, says UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations mission, said hundreds of women will run in council elections in the provinces, with three women running for the role of vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the election process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will be held on April 5.
The Taliban have released threats against an election process that coincide with the transition from international hostilities to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will hand power peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will add to Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered out of a total registered 3.6 million voters.
When the Prime Minister was stripped of the call for an election two months ago, in a dastardly way insulting British intelligence by claiming that opinion polls had not affected that decision, there was hope it would provide robust, efficient government.

Men try to rest 13-year-old girl
Two young men, aged 19 and 23, are believed to have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.

GMB concerns over investment in Glasgow's McVitie factory
A union would like to reassure executives at biscuit maker McVitie about the long-term commitment to produce at its Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said the company had been silent about the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which makes Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits alongside other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he had invested more than £5 million in recent years.
He added that staff and union representatives would be "the first to learn" if their activities were to change.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland urged McVitie's to "raise concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines would not be pushed forward."
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the general site manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply affects our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is focusing heavily on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against a backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic production decline, the eastern end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving production presence at McVitie. "
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The branch manager at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly as we appreciate the continued engagement with staff and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago where some issues were openly discussed.
We discussed with employees that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our operations - and this applies to all of our divisions and locations - to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the legacy of Tollcross as a manufacturing facility and should our operations at the site change, the staff and their union representatives will be the first to know this. "

And then my soul made the first serious effort to comprehend what had been put into it in relation to heaven and hell; for the first time, I looked around me and saw nothing but an immeasurable abyss in front of me, in front of me.
"So you are sure, Helen, that there is a something called heaven; and that our souls will go there when we die?"
› Take it to the fourth finger of my left hand, and I belong to you, and you belong to me; and we shall leave this earth, and dwell upon our heavens.
She was close, and as I did not send a request to heaven to turn her away from me - as I had neither folded her hands, nor bowed her knees, or moved her lips - there she came: In great heavy vows, the electricity continued over me.
I could defeat the enclosure, but the occupant would fly to heaven before I could still call myself the owner of that shell of earthly clay.
Without a doubt, St John would have given the world this, had he been able to follow her, call her back, hold her back if she left him that way; but he did not want to give up an atom of his wariness to heaven; he did not want to give a single hope of true, eternal paradise for the elysium of her love.
But then she raised her old plea: "Oh, why did heaven want it that way?
He regretted him, but then he declared that in some respect the sick must rejoice, for it was the will of the Lord that would give him the opportunity to reconcile with heaven.
Her hands folded, she lifted her head and looked up to the sky.

At the points where these currents cut in the sky, they create the light; at their cutting point on Earth, they bring out the gold...
The creature that stood before my eyes possessed that superhuman beauty that can only come from heaven or from hell.
She set her roasted and dry eyes to the sky, to the sun, to the silver clouds that were shrouded here and there by deep blue triangles and trapezes; then she beat her down, looked around herself, to the earth, to the crowd, to the houses...
It is a man-worthy death that has waned throughout his life: A death that is not flesh and not fish, like the spirit of the real sceptic, a death that expresses quite the doubt and inconsistency that holds the middle between heaven and earth that holds one in the balance.
The beggars shouted, kicked, cursed and soared; and Quasimodo, who felt powerless against so many enemies, trembled for the gypsy and saw the angry faces more and more approaching his gallery, asked the sky for a miracle and rang his hands full of despair.
You'll find it in heaven. '
As for Quasimodo, who had not stopped fighting for a moment, when he saw this wild escape, he fell down on both knees and raised his hands to the sky; then, with the speed of a bird, he plummeted to that cell whose entrances he had defended so unscathed.
At times, with bewildered glances, he looked at a kind of narrow plate that was faintly formed ten feet deeper from the uplands of the Steinzierathen, and he asked the heavens, basically of his terrified heart, that he should be allowed to decide his life on this space of two feet in the fourth: Should it also take a hundred years.
We greet together about such works as "Ververt et Chartreuse" by Grasset, "Belphegor" of Macchiavelli, "Heaven and Hell" by Swedenborg, "The underground journey of the Nicolaus Klimm" of Holberg, the Chiromantie of Robert Flud, of Jean d'Indaginé and of de la Chambre.
In Him alone we find peace and consolation and salvation and love, "she said, and began to turn her eyes to heaven, praying as Alexei Alexandrovich concluded from her silence.
Of these, he knew none other than Henoch, who was caught alive in the sky.
Shortly before that, he had known all the names; but now he had completely forgotten them, by name, because Henoch was his favourite figure from all over the Old Testament and, in his head, followed a whole long line of thought, which he also now left himself to, while placing his eyes on his father's watch chain and on a button only half-cropped on his waistband.
The squalor of the wait that she, hovering between heaven and earth, was going through in Moscow, Alexei Alexandrov's slowness and indecision, her association, everything she put to him.
A severe thunder came down rolling and polishing from the sky and lost in the distance in dull groom.
Did the PSG warn Barcelona of Neymar three years ago?
La Liga side may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not relent in their pursuit of Neymar after making a £189 million bid to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world record three years ago?
The sensational approach has fuelled the summer transfer window, with the Ligue 1 club ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for £89 million last season.
Once finished, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and the highest paid professional athlete in the world, with PSG offering wages of more than £500,000 a week.
Barcelona are furious at the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalan board insists the club has always done its best to look after him since arriving from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect by the PSG president three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club wanting to sign one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not concerned because they know that if they touch one of our players then we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to have one of our players sign with them, it will have consequences. '
Barcelona appear to have crossed that line, with the Spanish club expressing an interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear they would not allow the international from Italy to leave in any circumstances and Barcelona could feel the consequences of that interest by losing one of their prize offers for Neymar.

Each course was completed with a test that was more of a success check for further planning than an exam.
I would like to take part in the course with which you can become a nurse. "
A course called "Racism and Xenophobia at Work" was offered for three groups of district administration staff.
This course was aimed at staff with supervisory functions, workers of foreign origin and teachers from the nursing profession.
The course should create a positive working environment and prevent "cultural collisions," ensure that staff know more about each other, provide more accurate information on the agreements of political parties on immigrant and refugee issues, and encourage work within the framework of local action programmes.
This course addressed prejudices and hostile attitudes as a result of ignorance and provided an opportunity for practice-oriented discussions on xenophobia and racism, thus achieving a long-term change in attitudes.
Another initiative is a course at the LO schools on "Introduction to the Danish Trade Union Movement," which aims to encourage ethnic minorities to use trade unions for themselves.
In this course, prejudice and hostile attitudes have been addressed as a result of ignorance, and there has been an opportunity for practical discussions on xenophobia and racism, which should lead to a long-term change in attitudes.
Analysis of the teaching material available for each course and identification of the necessary teaching material

But we in the Socialist Group have all too often had the impression that the Commission has sometimes deviated from its course imperceptibly, but always in a negative direction.

This shows, Madam President, that the henceforth regime, which is supported by the military in the Grande, is taking a hard line against dissidents, for which we, all 12 states of the European Union, share responsibility, because, although Parliament has sounded the alarm several times, not only human rights but also fundamental democratic principles are being violated.
I fully support my colleague's view that Parliament's co-decision under Article 129d is necessary for both proposals.
The cumbersome tanker Europe with 12 captains - one thicker, the other narrower - is not progressing, and it has no clear course.
As the Council's work has not yet been completed, at this stage it is not in a position to comment on the course it intends to pursue in this matter.
Now the president can follow the course he has embarked on unimpeded and, as I understand it, lead his team in finding a middle ground.
I would just like to say briefly that this morning, at my suggestion, the Commission adopted an interesting communication on this subject, which, on the one hand, is, of course, based on the budgetary stance, but at the same time identifies a number of new opportunities that Europe should draw on.
Germany has spared no effort and no sacrifices to achieve this objective, and you will understand, Mr President, that, in my recognition, I include Chancellor Kohl, who has held on to this course with the same courage and determination.
Therefore, although this report is addressed to all the European institutions, it is, above all, justified as an internal discussion paper by our Parliament, because it is intended to set the most democratic course for our parliamentary route during 1999.

Such a market structure attracts internationalization because national oligopolies look for a stable single market elsewhere to increase their sales.
Price reductions in the event of overshooting of agreed sales figures: In France automatic price reductions apply to products whose sales significantly exceed the sales figures stated in the original price calculation application.
Uniform EC standards also give the European car industry an important competitive edge over truck manufacturers outside the Community, as 57 states are now adopting EC standards in their national legislation, because they have recognised that they are also useful and practicable for their countries; this encourages truck sales and, at the same time, creates thousands of new jobs within the Community, which we so desperately need, Mr Collins.
It seems important to me to note that all the companies in the European car industry have had record years in sales by the beginning of 1980, and that the advance of Japanese competition has been anticipated for a long time, including by the car industry in Europe, which perhaps partly believed that things were continuing so favourably without the need to make an appropriate effort.
It will exacerbate intra-European competition, because even the Community's Member States, which have so far tried to secure a restrictive position vis-à-vis Japanese competition, will very soon find that European suppliers will find their way onto the market of these countries in order to secure sales of their cars in spite of increased Japanese imports.
In view of the increasing supply of milk in the Community during 1982 and the corresponding increase in butter production, the Commission considers that two types of measures are needed in the short term, partly to ensure a reasonable sales of butter stocks, partly in order to prevent the Butterberg from growing again.
As you know, the Community has fallen considerably behind in this area over the last ten years, as shown by its sales, which were already moderate at the time.
Both the Subcommittee on Technical Barriers to Trade and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs believe that the noise level of household appliances plays a role in sales and that this problem is solved by competition, the market forces themselves, so that there is no need for legislation.
The Community's consumer organisations, like the Socialist Group, have been tirelessly pointing out for years that only a shift away from sales and price guarantees and the move to genuine structural policy can put the process back on track.
With such an action, this country could have artificially increased its sales on the world market in 1985, which would undoubtedly have made the already difficult situation in this market worse.
I am prepared to consider such an abolition at the time when a level of production is achieved that is acceptable for internal use and for sales.
Can the Commission indicate the extent to which the sale of unleaded petrol has replaced the sales of leaded petrol in each Member State of the Community?
So anything that serves to increase quality and improve marketing and sales should be supported by us.
The European Parliament recently decided not to promote intervention measures for these products, but rather to promote market-oriented sales by improving the quality of supply.
Contrary to the hopes of all, but also to Norway's outspoken expectations, sales on the Japanese market did not increase in 1995, and there has even been a slight decline.
On the other hand, the Commission is promoting the sale of Community rice in the internal market by means of a cautious export policy.
However, in view of the differing views of the Member States as regards the promotion of sales in the internal market and, overall, the positions of the Member States on the sales or promotion of the sales of alcoholic beverages, I believe that we have a problem here which would make it very difficult to enter into a common organisation of the market in wine.
This initiative is all the more correct given that we already have assessments of the campaigns to promote the sales of olive oil and fibre - as Mr Fantuzzi also pointed out - whose sales in third countries have increased thanks to the promotion of ad hoc instruments.
In this context, I would like to stress that I consider the desire for increased sales mentioned in the Fantuzzi report to be positive.
It is necessary for the EU to pursue an active export policy that goes beyond the use of export refunds and, in addition to the export refunds already in place, can have a positive effect on the sales of agricultural products.
In the Community, sales of starch and its derivatives are supported by production aid when these products are used in sectors that are not subject to import protection, such as in the chemical, pharmaceutical and paper industries.
The concept of tariff preferences is based on the recognition that it is particularly difficult for those countries whose industry is still under construction, i.e. the developing countries, to increase their sales on the markets of the developed countries.
In the Community's view, this system was, at least in part, the cause of the very sharp decline in Community car exports to Greece recently, while the suppliers of certain third countries were able to maintain or even increase their sales.
- facilitate the sale of the quantities of agricultural products not covered by framework agreements on the world market.
(14) The impact on the Community industry concerned, in particular those companies that produce a large share of brand-free standard goods, was mainly reflected in a decline in production, in sales and market price losses, and in a significant fall in prices, combined with significant reductions in net revenues or rising losses.
- increased sales of raw materials from the ACP countries in the Eastern European countries;
Commissioner CHEYSSCN recalled that the alcohol market in the Community is going through a clearly declining trend, which naturally affects the sales of rum as well as other spirits in this market.
Their production and sales rose 2% from 1981 to 1984.
Compare Community data on the production and sales of industrial products;
- compare Community data on the production and sales of industrial products; - assess domestic markets; compare economic sectors; - know the current situation and plan the future of these industries; - better inform and become more competitive.
In recent years, sales of natural gas have broken down as follows:
The sales were distributed as follows (1984 estimate):
For its part, sales to households in 1984 were distributed according to the following zones: KWh / year
In 1984, sales on the public network were distributed as follows (preliminary results):
These associations, which are professional bodies subject to civil law, may serve the joint purchase or sharing of agricultural machinery as well as the collective supply of their members and the collective sales of their products, subject to the express condition not to distribute any profits (and not in the form of refunds) to their members.
Without neglecting the important aspect of the supply of raw materials, a stronger focus on sales and market problems was therefore urgently needed.
The increased sales of motor vehicles in 1994 led to a slight recovery in the production of the rubber industry, although production has still not reached the 1992 level in value terms.
The fact that large companies are weakened, or even close altogether, also contributes to the buoyant development of small businesses and their share of sales in France from 1980 to 1988 by 10%.
Sales of coal coke have decreased from 45 million tonnes to 40 million tonnes in the Community since 1990. In this period, the percentage declines in the individual countries have been between 3% (UK) and 17% (Luxembourg).
Sales of coal coke in the EU decreased by 1.8 million tonnes (4.4%) from 39.7 million tonnes in 1992 to 37.9 million tonnes in 1993.
The beef shortage is likely to have favoured the sales of poultry meat, the prices of which are relatively low and attractive to the consumer.
A decision under Article 86 made it compulsory for the United Brands Company to give up the following abusive practices in the sale of Chiquita bananas within the common market: Closure of the market as a result of the ban on the sale of green bananas; refusal to supply different prices to Irish, German, Danish, Dutch and Belgian customers; application of unreasonable prices for customers of the latter four Member States.
The main measures introduced in 1972 for the sales of butter and skimmed milk powder surpluses have continued this year; in particular, butter has been distributed to certain food industries and consumer groups.
However, the continuing poor economic situation in the second half of 1975 has resulted in significant losses in the sales of coal and coke to the thermal power stations and to the iron and steel industries.
The Joint Expert Group, set up following the visit of President Jenkins to Tokyo in October 1977, will continue to examine in detail the conditions for the access of Community products to the Japanese market in the sectors where sales could be increased.
On the other hand, however, sales should also be secured.
(I) either the commissions usually paid or agreed on sales in the Community or the usual increments for profit and general costs (including the direct and indirect costs of sales) for imported goods of the same genus or species;
The Community supports the financing of works which help to increase production, reduce production prices or facilitate the sales of the products concerned.
(I) either the commissions usually paid or agreed on sales in the Community or the usual increments for profit and general costs (including the direct and indirect costs of sales) for imported goods of the same genus or species;
Tunisia's sales of industrial products are heavily concentrated on clothing and, to a lesser extent, on textiles (more than 18% of all exports in 1979), in part due to the spectacular increase in "passive finishing," which followed the investments of companies from Community countries, in particular the Federal Republic of Germany.
This could even lead, as is already the case with the North's products, to the Community displacing established exporters through subsidised sales on the world market.
Morocco, in particular, managed to redistribute its sales from France and the Federal Republic to the Benelux and Scandinavia, and in particular the USSR and Saudi Arabia.
This solution should have the merit of having a less open Community obligation than revenue guarantees or guaranteed / sales on the markets of the Community itself.
Since in most of these cases employment has at least the same importance as the effects on the balance of payments, it would be a better way to guarantee sales of reduced quantities, but at higher (possibly intra-Community) prices than before.
The ban on minimum prices does not apply to the sales of books, newspapers and magazines or to goods and services subject to specific legislation in which minimum or fixed prices are established.
They constitute a crucial framework for the opportunities for promotion and development for regional production and employment.
For mineral raw materials such as copper, phosphate, iron ore, ACP countries receive project support when production and sales are at risk and export earnings fall as a result.
The overall concentration in the food production and processing sector is low in terms of sales.
Of course, this programme is not a panacea for European agriculture: On a case-by-case basis, it can help to open up new opportunities for sales and income.
As long as the crisis continues, we are often accused of protectionism on both sides; this accusation is levelled at lobbies who encounter obstacles in the sales of their products or who fear that their market will be swamped by products that no longer flow into the usual outlets.
Dutch exports, which account for a significant proportion (almost 30% in 1983) of raw materials and precursors whose sales are particularly responsive to economic developments, could be stimulated, in particular, by the current stock formation.
This would be a considerable increase in volume, bearing in mind that the forecasts for sales in foreign markets amounted to 440 billion m3 in mid-1983.
Indeed, it is likely that the demand for steel products is unlikely to increase, which is likely to be reflected in a rather slow increase in total exports, although sales of the new companies will develop dynamically.
While sales of natural gas abroad continued to decline compared with 1986, exports of manufactured goods were relatively buoyant, despite the sharp appreciation of the gulp in 1986 and 1987.
As ministries continued to hold control over the supply of raw materials and prices, and were able to guarantee sales, most business leaders appeared to be more interested in a good relationship with the apparatus than in demanding their newfound entrepreneurial freedom.
In addition, Parliament must be represented on the Europol Management Board and must be allowed to take part in the election of the Director of this institution.
Police are appealing for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because he matched a car in his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to depart, touching the guide.
On Thursday night, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was travelling with his VW at 7.55pm on the B 215 from Stolzenau towards Leese.
In the area of the locality of Stolzenau, a car came up to him on his lane, so he had to depart to the right.
In doing so, the Touran driver touted the guide.
There was damage to the car.
The driver of the oncoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a lorry and continued its journey without taking care of the road accident.
It may be good, according to the accident victim, that the Mercedesist had not even noticed the accident.
Police are now appealing for witnesses to the incident, as well as the driver of the "polluter pays" vehicle, to contact the commissioner's office in Stolzenau on tel. 05761 / 92060.
The lack of storage and transport capacity, as well as organisational difficulties, mean that manure must be "disposed of" on agricultural land that is favourable to the environment.
These bookshops present the publications of EUR-OP in a shop window or part of a shop window reserved for this purpose and must have the most important publications of EUR-OP in stock all the time; they must also be connected to an online ordering system for the procurement of non-stock titles.
The decline in domestic consumption due to economic crisis, the falling income of the workforce due to unemployment and high inflation, as well as the decline in exports of Greek wines, have led to the emergence of significant stocks, for example in Crete, Santorini and other areas, following accession to the EEC.
In addition to the 1981s harvest, there are still 115 000 tonnes of the 1980s harvest in stock that could not be put down.
Only one of the speakers mentioned the possibility that his own garden could become a storage space for radioactive waste.
We should be ashamed that we have huge quantities of milk and butter in stock, while in the Third World children are dying of starvation.
It can, of course, also reject them at this stage, but this would only mean a postponement, because the day will surely come when the Council is forced to reduce quotas and dissolve the camps.
However, the honourable Member's observation that 50 000 tonnes of last year's harvest is in stock is to be contradicted.
If we continue with our set-aside programme, we will soon have 18 million tonnes in stock.
The Commission is suggesting that the stocks are too large, which is not true, because less than nine million tonnes of stocks, not even 6% of annual production, is not excessive, but let us leave that aside.
After intervention purchases, we have 200 000 tonnes of butter in stock, quite apart from the East German stocks, and by the end of this year these stocks will grow to about 270 000 tonnes.
The war will come to an end, and in the camp of the defeated, as in the camp of the victors, we will take stock.
There are 40 000 tonnes of salmon in stock which will soon be thrown onto the world market.
According to press reports, an old cargo ship has been deployed in the Saronic Gulf, which eight years ago has been turned into a floating laboratory and a warehouse for the oil-containing waste of the passing ships.
The offers must be directed to the intervention centres, which have good stock and resale opportunities.
And now we are told that the camps are too expensive.
Most of my group supports the rapporteur's amendment that military facilities or camps should fall within the scope of the directive.
The entire camp is divided into different rooms.
In principle, it should be possible for Germany, France or England to dump their radioactive waste in a warehouse in Sweden.
The concentration of production capacity allows for maximum economies of scale and leads to the abandonment of intermediate production, storage and handling locations, resulting in ballooning effects in the production and distribution areas.
Up to the point of individualization, the number of warehouses is kept as low as possible, reducing storage risk, storage costs and throughput times.
Specific applications include: Business people who want to retrieve their fax and e-mail transfers from outside and without special equipment, sellers who want to check without a terminal whether a given product is in stock, and individuals who want to check their bank account by phone.
Development of intelligent storage and handling systems to optimize product quality.
New developments in the field of biotechnology enable novel approaches to reduce the loss of quality and the development of environmentally friendly storage and handling systems.
- at levels 03 and 04 in direct connection with the warehouse and the loading zone (FG.GH.GM and MN): The premises for the printing and distribution as well as the rooms of the maintenance services;
This service takes care of removals, warehousing (including the warehouses in Overijse) as well as insurance and collection of the stock.
This could not be achieved, however, as the negotiating conference was unable to address the differences of opinion on certain fundamental issues (in particular the question of the general size of the warehouses, their allocation to the Member States, the details of the participation of developing countries in storage, and the price levels at which the stock intervenes through reception or levy).
The Council decided to increase the monthly increments for the 1981 / 82 marketing year by about 20% in order to take into account the development of storage and financing costs for cereals and the need to reduce the stocks of cereals in line with the needs of the market.
This increase, which applies to cereals, flour of wheat and rye, as well as to rough and fine gries of wheat, was granted within the framework of the objectives of the basic Regulation "Cereals" and with regard to the storage and financing costs for cereals in the Community, as well as the need to reduce the stocks of cereals in a way that does not cause market disturbances.
Data processing, office, procurement, general maintenance, equipment maintenance, vehicle park, driver, warehouse and archives
The Council took this decision within the framework of the objective of the basic Regulation on cereals, in order to take into account the storage and financing costs of the Community cereals sector and to allow a sales of the stocks of cereals which do not lead to market disturbances.
Installation of a 300-hectare Oelpalms and an 835 ha cocoa plant on the east coast of the island of Neuirland; construction of a palm oil mill as well as storage and loading facilities; rehabilitation of cocoa processing plants;
- the premises for the printing and distribution as well as the rooms of the maintenance services located at levels 03 and 04 in direct connection with the warehouse and the loading zone (Traces FG, GH, GM and MN);
While staff working at the business premises need lower qualifications, those responsible for warehouse management and data technology need a far higher level of education and training.
Changes in stocks can be determined either as a difference between the stock at the end and the stock existing at the beginning of the reporting year, or as a difference between the access to the warehouse and the departures from the warehouse during the reporting year.
It excludes port vehicles, ladders and trawlers used in seaports, ferries, fishing vessels, dredging vessels, vessels for hydraulic works and vessels used exclusively as warehouses, floating workshops, houseboats and for recreational purposes.
The rapid growth in final demand in some Member States in the quarterly period has led to a reduction in the stocks in France (-1.2% of GDP) in the Netherlands (-1.0% of GDP), in Denmark (-0.7% of GDP) and Sweden (-0.2% of GDP), with the latter three having also changed to an opposite trend compared to the previous quarter.
Sales of olive oil from the Italian intervention site were repeated; at the end of 1978, some 95 000 tonnes were still in stock.
Workshops and warehouses are necessary for mechanical maintenance, boiler work, electrical repairs, etc.
X-Three performs numerous tasks; it manages the warehouse and distribution centre; its premises span 5.4 hectares; it employs more than 640 people, roughly 240 of whom are responsible for managing X-Three.
"As Belgian branches, even if any representation that is capable of entering into obligations for the foreign company is missing, the seats of the actual management, branches, factories, plants, workshops, agencies, stores, offices, laboratories, shopping or sales offices, warehouses, as well as all stationary facilities which, in their own way, yield income."
In particular, the General Court would like to know whether such a purchase is available when the purchase agreement has been concluded between two companies established outside the Community's customs territory, but the buyer, a subsidiary of the seller, has a branch established in that area which has the task of ordering the goods from the seller, managing the warehouses and selling the goods to the customer, in particular to distributors for the products sold under the parent company's trademark.
Value of stocks (in stock) at the beginning of the financial year (animals only).
Amount already collected or to be collected from sales of products in stock at the beginning of the financial year or from products harvested during the financial year.

Rooms where feedingstuffs are stored should be cool, dry and protected against insects and insects; the spaces used as storage for bedding should be dry as well as protected against insects and insects.
This complex comprises facilities for the production of more than 560 000 tonnes of sulphuric acid, 220 000 tonnes of phosphoric acid and 240 000 tonnes of fertilisers per year, as well as other related equipment, including a thermal power plant with a turbogenerator of 13 MW and storage and support facilities.
Commission opinion 90 / 389 / EEC on the Windscale glazing plant and the glazed radioactive waste warehouse (United Kingdom).
Therefore, a high elasticity to the share of capital inflows in the assets can correspond to a small adjustment of the stock.
Apart from losses from the ongoing storage, processing and transportation difficulties, supply will decline because farmers, who are obviously expecting a further price increase following the increase in government purchase prices in May 1990, are hoarding the grain.
Obviously, the stock of pre and intermediate products that were partially dismantled in the spring will be replenished somewhat.
The development outlook for production, for its part, remains positive, even if it deteriorates by one point (+ 5 compared to + 6), thus regaining its July level, which is undoubtedly linked to slightly less favourable expectations regarding the size of the stock of unsold finished goods (+ 12 compared to + 11) (Table 2).
The indicator is the means of the answers (balances) to the questions about the production prospects, the order books and the stock (the latter after changing the sign).
The indicator is the means of the answers (balances) to the questions about the production prospects, the order books and the stock (the latter after changing the sign).
The overall optimistic climate in the industry has been somewhat tempered by the slight weakness in the assessment of orders and inventories that occurred in May compared with the previous month.
The indicator is the means of the answers (balances) to the questions about the production prospects, the order books and the stock (the latter after changing the sign).
The depletion in the bricks will be considerable in 1985 (particularly in the UK), but will be almost fully offset by an increase in the stock in the UK's power plants.
For example, at the end of August 1975, at 960 000 tonnes, the Near Community had almost 1 Mill, t (1974 322 000 t) in stock, although production had fallen by 2.4% in 1974 compared to 1973 and the increase in the first months of 1975 (January to April) did not seem as spectacular at 6.2%.
In recent years, the preservation, storage and transport of milk products have been developed, disseminated and approved in such a way that the supra-regional supply of all dairy products is now practicable.
The determination requirement is met if all goods stored in a given room are secured ("space security contract") or when items to be transferred from the warehouse are individually marked ("marking contracts").
However, the market can also be supported by more elastic measures such as storage or distillation aid, withdrawal by producer groups and others.
Interview: 'Domspatzen report relieves Pope's brother Georg Ratzing'
The Regensburg Domspatzen report into the abuses relieves Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger.
This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann means.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to spark debate.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the "We are Church" reform movement, said after publication to the German Press Agency that he expected an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or their incorrect assessment of what was going on at the time.
The Vatican newspaper, "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised the use of "double standards" in the reporting of violence at the Domspatzen.
Regarding the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that these are "disgraceful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; but what is striking is the "degree of media manipulation," according to author Lucetta Scaraffia, a historian and member of the national Italian bioethics committee.
"The habit of describing the Catholic Church as the source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to think this is normal," Scaraffia writes.
In an interview with the Bavarian Broadcasting Corporation, Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said: "You like to go to church and this is a found fresher."
She also pointed out that in her youth "beatings were a very normal educational means" to cope with cheeky children, as I was one. "
It would be unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports of the abuses, Pope's brother, Georg Ratzinger, also often appeared.
Quite wrongly, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the memorabilia "My Brother the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the lawyer, Ulrich Weber, who was appointed by the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment?
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were victims of assault, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused, "with high plausibility" between 1945 and the early 1990s.
In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, said: "In summary, it can be said that in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence were used by Domkapellmeister R.
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe in the process.
Still, unlike many other defectors, it is striking that many victims appreciated R. "s general humanity and therefore, in numerous cases, even combine positive memories with him, despite violence."
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen, in his opinion, relieves Georg Ratzinger.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of the use of force on protective orders at the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
For one thing, many students highlight his "humanity."
On the other hand, he also appears as a cholerian and perfectionist who was often handcuffed when a domesticity did not produce a top performance musically.
As his biographer, how do you evaluate this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble and read the whole 440-page report from front to back, you have to wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger is in it at all.
He is devoted to just eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the horrific cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence at the pre-school also occurred outside his sphere of influence.
At best, you can accuse him of learning about it too late or of not taking first hints seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he acted, was seen by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."
For example, the vast majority of his students also provide a very excellent testimony to Georg Ratzinger, describing him as "warm-hearted," "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and candies and was "always surrounded by grapes from children."
Only a minority complain about his perfectionism and high emotionality, which has also led to wreckage.
The fact that he not only knelt with chairs and threw the keyring on the floor, but also distributed earbuds and pulled all too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
It must be said, however, that such educational methods were widely used in the period in question, the 1960s and 1970s, for both parents and teachers.
Do you know any such breeding methods?
Of course, I think every one of us born before 1968.
I, too, still experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
However, compared with what this report is actually about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the acts of violence at pre-school, these are trivials.
One wonders if it's not more to do with his notoriety and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI, that a lot of the media just came crashing down on him.
At the Bavarian pope, many who have never understood him are still eager to work.
But the truth is that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
A great deal has been reported in the media in connection with the report on the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
In the final report, will Georg Ratzinger also be charged with any involvement or complicity with regard to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
Not a single one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellmeister.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," one sufferer said, representing the others, "It was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem with the investigation of sexual abuse was, and still is, that most victims remain silent out of shame.
If they hadn't even entrusted themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not to a choir leader who, in a sense, would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a way.
How do the Domspatzen students rate Ratzinger's role with regard to the cases of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: A questioning student put it this way: "Regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely intelligence and could have stopped the respective offender.
I think it is... also really absurd to assume that, according to him... cheers have become more intrusive, or clearer, or even more open, than towards their parents, boarding school leaders, trust teachers, etc.
That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. '
For example, the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that students and / or their environment were entrusted to him beforehand could not be confirmed as part of the investigation."
So as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is free of any complicity.
Nor can he be accused of failing to prevent or display him.
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these odious crimes, as has unfortunately happened in some cases.
There was a lot of talk in the media of "acts of violence" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
Former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of "looking away" in the report.
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That's the big problem, after all, that in reporting everything was mixed up and menaced into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that, in turn, is an abuse of the report.
It is, after all, neatly separated: Between the pre-school and the high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and acts of violence, and, let us say, other allegations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the Domspatzen.
All the terrible canon pedagogy, the cases in which boys were downright harassed and maligned by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly, all occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with those, because he only got to face the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
On that, as the vast majority of witnesses point out, the issue of "pre-school" was taboo.
One was only happy to have escaped her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paraplegic" conditions.
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was already discipline, but just no sadistic violence.
And the same is true of Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even combine positive memories with him, despite violence."
Thus, at most, there remains the charge of having looked away.
But despite all the efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was told of the conditions at pre-school.
The first time in 1970-71, when he just started to establish himself and didn't want to hear about the events at a school where he just didn't work and was responsible, (according to the witness), and then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears before the states?
Michael Hesemann: No, because back in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it, he points out to them "that caning continues to be practiced in pre-school."
Even in the face of the risk of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when there was legal clarity, when caning had long been banned in Bavaria, too.
Before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as any of us probably still know.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where those affected might have exaggerated or dramatised and where the allowable limit had really been exceeded.
But you also can't say he'd always looked away.
That is simply not true.
It wasn't until 1980 that caning in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria, too.
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed, of course, that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians talk about the "pitfall of anachronism," that is, the danger of assessing the past by today's moral standards.
The prince is right there.
But this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which has been abhorrent at all times, and also not to what has been brokered in pre-school of revulsion and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes well beyond what was usual at the time.
That's all quite horrible and I'm glad it's finally being worked out.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishing, that is, earnest and pulling at the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What image of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger play in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Was the issue of caning also mentioned?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, told from his perspective, since the Domspatzen only played a side role.
Nevertheless, I am by no means hiding the fact that he led a strict regiment there.
But that, too, has to be said: Without this perfectionism, without the demand for unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world-class institution from the hitherto more nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, who went on tour twice in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and candies alone, you don't make great singers out of restless boys and before any success, no matter what area, you always have discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
What kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger during the conversations on her book?
Michael Hesemann: By working on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger quite well and always saw him as a wonderful, humorous, principled, deeply believer and heartfelt person who you can't imagine he could even do anything to a fly.
I regularly get to see how many former Domspatzen still make regular contact with him today, 23 years after he was emailed, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.
So those who, to this day, do not forgive him for once being strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them the world of music.
And that he was always a good, vexatious teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely respect person to whom they still look up today and whom they downright worship.
And please, again, let me be very clear: All you accuse him of is educational methods that were on the agenda at the time.
We can be glad that we have long since overcome this time.
But it is highly unfair to make a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother, a media scapegoat.
The evil intent behind this is all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves it.
Now the decency would be to finally leave a 93-year-old man who has earned great merit and without whom, outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany, no one would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen, at last in peace.
With all the difficulties and with all the lack of resources in carrying out these operations, I can make the welcome announcement that last year we also managed to significantly reduce the United Nations' commitment in Tajikistan and the Central African Republic.
4. urges the immediate implementation of the reinforced debt relief programme for the highly indebted poor countries and the removal of all bilateral public debt of these countries in the context of poverty reduction in return for the demonstrable use of these countries for poverty reduction as part of their overall development strategy and asks the international community for its support for comprehensive and effective debt relief for African countries;

In addition to the prime minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the memorial ceremony.
Some of the jurors have said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years, and her daughters, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, had met her with disgust.
Moreover, the scandal is of less concern to the victims than to the "executioners."
Orwell's prophecy could have turned out to be perfectly correct since then, where you can control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the chosen highway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
With his attempt to score a goal for the team of Eric Cantona himself, this original player was stealing all the show.
When I was 21 and scored 16 goals, I got two offers to play in Spain, but everyone said, "You up to young, wait a year...."
Two people sit down at a table and try to get a ball into their opponent's gate.
