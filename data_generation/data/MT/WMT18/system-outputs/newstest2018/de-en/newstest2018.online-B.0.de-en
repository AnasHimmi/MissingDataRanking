Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A lunatic asylum, where today teens should meet.
A crypt chapel, where now for the rapid-transit railway tunnel is dug.
Allotment gardeners cultivate the former reason of farmers.
Munich's oldest official map brings exciting stories to light.
It is annoying when maps are out of date.
Everybody knows this, who had to be upset sometimes, because the car navigation system instead of a bypass indicated a green field.
The historical maps of the digital Bavaria atlas, an offer of the geoportal Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but for that very reason very enlightening.
Especially when compared to current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the area of circulation of the Münchner Merkur since the 19th century.
The digital Bavaria Atlas is a patchwork that you do not immediately recognize as such.
In the large outline map for cities and municipalities more detailed maps, so-called Urpositionsblätter, were incorporated.
These were created according to the Bavarian Surveying Administration between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.
Her client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Although the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, it was today's neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern card.
Elector Max IV Joseph pushed the project forward, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Surveying Department.
The Urpositionsblatt for Munich dates from 1856 and can be found on the Bayerische Landesbibliothek website, like all others.
The comparison of past / present is most impressive with the example of the state capital.
The city expanded in all directions and grew together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated.
Sendling was incorporated 21 years after the map was created, ie in 1877, as the Munich district.
Untersendling is in the middle of the city today.
The houses Untersendlings concentrate around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.
Where today is the West Park, you see nothing but fields - at first glance: Zooming in a smaller-scale map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-numbered parcels from the so-called "Uraufnahme", from which the property tax was derived.
Small parcels there no longer prove farmers today - but allotment gardeners of the plant "Land in Sonne".
A large green area is visible north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the Oktoberfest, was actually still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
The Urpositionsblatt reads in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the hill "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on the Auerfeldstraße once locked people with delusions.
There, in 1858/59, the Munich district mental asylum "Auf der Auer Lüften" was created.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment - that psychiatrist who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chaining of so-called lunatics.
In addition, he has forbidden the staff to use force against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Museum Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the asylum.
There was initially room for 280 patients, later it was extended to 500 places.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the district hospital in Haar 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of the largest psychiatric hospitals in Germany, is located there.
On the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt now meet young people in the Munich Salesianum.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training companies.
West is the football field of TSV Munich East, east residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural style to the original building of the lunatic asylum, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids.
The Marienplatz was listed as "Hauptplatz" around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
A decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich.
The bombs of the Allies tore in December 1944 many holes in the city center.
A large one remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small commercial buildings and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on April 5, 2017, the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn trunk line.
With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial photo of today - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof.
He reports that those waiting in line at the security check keep asking what the problem is and get the answer from the security officials "There is no problem".
On the whole, it was smooth in most places, even if it was quite inefficient in the hospital - people jammed in a long line ".
I left the polling station around 5:00 pm and the line was about a kilometer long.
A line in front of a Takoyaki shop.
Ahmad Shuja has uploaded a photo on Twitter, where people are waiting in line to get their voting card.
At some polling stations in Malawi, the queues were so long that people at the end of the queue could not see the polling station.
"Today the snake is long," she notes as she leaves.
Usually there is an extra queue for the students.
"And they closed the queue for the students, but that's important," Vicki continues, ignoring Arlet.
Civil Rights Group publishes Travel Alert for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Color has issued a warning to colored people traveling to Missouri for their discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, due to enter into force on August 28, 2017, requires African-American travelers, visitors, and Missourians to pay special attention and extreme caution when traveling through the state, as a number of questionable racial-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state," the statement said.
A recent Missouri law that makes it harder for people to seek discrimination and law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities led the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
"They have civil rights violations that happen to people.
They are arrested for their skin color, they are beaten up or killed, "said Missouri NAACP President Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such frequency that we have not heard before."
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances early in the year after he ran out of gas on his way through the state and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Attorney General of Missouri, which shows that black drivers in the state are being arrested 75 percent more than whites.
"The recommendation is for people to be aware and to inform their families, friends and co-workers what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People have to be willing to bring bail money or let relatives know they're going through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, which ranked the country 16th in terms of the number of such injuries.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws obliging local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will help shape racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department to other countries, but lately stakeholders have used the measure in response to specific laws and trends within the United States.
There are about 13 branch offices in the northwestern border province, and there are 30 other camps in Balochistan, although smaller.
We can no longer look at the problem from the point of view of participation or non-participation, and thus go to one of the two opposing camps.
At present, logistic warehouses, rolling transports, and the expansion of world airports in southern Afghanistan are creating the military conditions for getting Baluchistan under control and reaching the Indian Ocean.
The hospitals and polyclinics as well as the camps near the border were looted.
There are day and night guarded United Nations camps.
The Israeli government assured the presidency that security measures would be strengthened by Palestinian camps.
With the reopening of the camps, the combing of ordinary people's residential neighborhoods by the police, and mass arrests early in the morning, the regime wanted to react brutally, in our view scandalously, to the growing discontent and popular anger at the regime's difficulties and economic failure.
This organization has limited responsibility for helping refugees living outside the camp.
In fact, there are countries in which there is a kind of revolt around the camps, because the local population feels that the refugees in the camps are better off than they are.
Their camps are being bombed.
They preserve as memorials and symbols the camps of torture and the workshops of death.

The resolution of Mr Luster addresses in particular the camps in Angola, which are controlled by SWAPO.
Mr President, I conclude with the simple statement that while we are content with the electoral process, we are not satisfied with the demobilization, since the Honduran Government has prevented the international organizations mentioned in the Tela Convention from visiting the Contras camps lately.
It places itself in the brakes of European development, those who see strengthening the EC as a provocation towards Moscow and Eastern Europe, which is a very unfortunate development.
We welcome everything that the Commission has done and I am sure that the Commissioner will insist on a thorough investigation of the camps during his visit to the camps.
Many died in the resistance, others fled to camps in neighboring PNG, but even there they can not feel safe.
I agree with the Honorable Member about the importance of preserving concentration camps for future generations as a testimony to the Nazi crimes against humanity, but I am aware that the sites of several camps have already been placed under the permanent protection of the competent national and local authorities for the reason mentioned by the Honorable Member.
I have visited another camp than Mrs Ewing: a camp with 97 000 refugees on the border with Somalia, which was run by non-governmental organizations, the European Community and other donors.
Without naming names, I would like to say that there are two camps among the "nay-campers".
However, it appears that several of these warehouses are under the constant protection of the competent national and / or local authorities.
I have long since buried the old leftist and Rousseauian utopia responsible for the millions of deaths of the gulag and the camps of Communist China.
Parts of the population are being deported to camps in the Arab North, with the sole purpose of taking away from the Nuba people their Christian faith and culture.
The Community and its Member States have also condemned the existence of detention centers, especially in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and called for camps to be promptly opened for international inspection and to be dissolved as soon as possible.
Incidentally, this can equally be blamed on the Lebanese government, whose refusal to allow the deported Palestinians into the country, as well as their refusal to allow aid agencies access to the makeshift camp, has no other purpose than to exploit the matter for political purposes to the detriment of Israel.
For several weeks, after the discovery of the camps, we discover the rapes.
Such attention and financial support must not be confined to warehouses located within the territory of the Community, but they must also, if not above all, apply to warehouses located in the rest of Europe.

Fence fence project is elemental
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a successful project and will be continued in the coming year.
The CDU Bundestag members Peter White and Kordula Kovac have gained a local image.
At the grave yard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbach CDU Ortsverband met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.
Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his business, where he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, cared for 40 dairy cows and just as many cubs and housed holiday guests in five apartments.
The "Black Forest Milk" is for him the alternative marketing method for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann.
On the table of holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
As he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the pasture fence project as "of fundamental importance".

In 2003, he took over his parents' business and managed it without chemical crop protection and fertilizer, even if he did not run an organic farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the fence project and is glad about the Leader promotion".
At costs of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, the farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that the afforestation of the land could be pulled out for quite a while.
"The biggest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture who are worried about how to move their business forward," the mayor said.
Farmers are often criticized for their support
In 2013, a total of 25 parcels of 11 participants were fenced in via the pasture fence support.
The open space is therefore 40 hectares, which may not be reforested until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was funded by Leader, a quarter carried the community Fischerbach.
This left the farmers with 12 610 euros to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence.
"The big advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac emphasized: "You do a really good job, you can not do without farmers and rural women".
Peter Weiss was also clear: "The best food is produced here".
The Landscape Conservation Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the public support of pasture fences.

Prerequisite is the presence of a designated by the LPR funding backdrop.
In addition, the fenced area may not be tug-managed (slope above 35 percent) and thus must be threatened by afforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018 is currently the application of eight participants with 24 parcels, which want to build almost 16 kilometers fence.
The open space corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.

Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty
The surest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as much as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein on Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic ax in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta over the President's proposals to drastically curtail legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he had.
But he attacked its meaning, and especially the meaning attributed to it, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed.
When Miller cursed Acosta, "I do not want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.
The poem you refer to that was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary response to the rousing words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / your beleaguered masses, who long to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "miserable garbage" could be better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's US.
This conflict over the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict over the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends, who were committed to putting their words to the ground after their deaths - knew very well that they were completing a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting in a worn-out classical pictorial representation the feminine incarnation of freedom.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.
The combination of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change it back a long time ago.
The great screamer Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone, but rather is an early neo-conservative that brings the American flame into the disreputable world: "Lady Liberty goes first.
She is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not supposed to light the way to the United States. "
Somewhat unusual, Limbaugh has come across something here.
The meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.
Lazarus' great imaginative act was to see her as seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It's literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.
And of course that's not the perspective Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.
Her torch is not meant to illuminate the path, but to ignite the hatred that is its only source of power.
2017 World Cup: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team
United Kingdom athletics director Neil Black says the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Cup squad will "make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and the athletics of the United Kingdom needs to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue to do it until we find out," Black said.
"I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.
British Athletics: It has something to do with what they did.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. "
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was selected by the team to team captain.
"Eilidh is pretty modest.
Your captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or work, walked out of the room feeling very proud and very motivated.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh brought in naturally was great. "
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete in her fifth World Championship at the 400m hurdles, says it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's best overall number of athletes in the World Cup was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Middle-distance runner Muir leads the way, setting five British and two European records last year.
She will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500m, is another Scot to watch after a great season of winning the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "extremely proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots not only belong to the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and voted for me makes it so special for me," she added.
"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team.
It just shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podiums.
As for my speech as a captain?
Yes, I think she was fine.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.
So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from being back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there. "
Crucial to the site was our desire to create an audio platform that provided a space for emerging talents from a variety of areas in the region.
Overall, the EP supported the harmonization proposals by a large majority, although some victims of participants and some deviations from the usual policy were sometimes demanded in some Member States because it was clear that no major progress towards greater freedom of movement could be achieved without harmonizing cost factors and legislation.
The need, the benefits and the progressive realization of such a project must be recognized and felt by all, so that the efforts and necessary sacrifices are made on a voluntary basis.
But how can we demand these sacrifices from our peoples, from our voters, when the same voters read daily in the paper about such human rights violations?
Nonetheless, I believe that farmers are ready to make these short-term sacrifices so that the health of the people can be improved in the long term.
Mr. Berkhouwer has pointed out how bitter this is for those athletes who have made sacrifices for years, who have taken privation to attend this event.
The point here is not that we would refuse to make a sacrifice, but the temporary impossibility of returning to the constituency and returning on Monday mornings.
The hanged men of Tunis have not died otherwise when their victim triggers a legitimate indictment of the regime of Bourguiba, this scion of the so-called free world, and if they are a confirmation of the need to oppose human rights abuses wherever they may occur.
Certainly they are words she has spoken with the feeling of a woman, a democrat, an anti-fascist fighter who knew the victim.
This is witnessed by the ministry and the sacrifices - even to human beings - to which some of the Nine were ready and willing to continue for this country and its people by allocating troop contingents to the UN peacekeeping forces.
Giving credibility to values also means convincing others that, if necessary, you are willing to make sacrifices for those values.
In the light of this situation, it seems logical that a co-responsibility levy should be levied on the fats of vegetable and marine origin imported into the Community in return for the sacrifices demanded of milk producers.
This also explains the heroic sacrifice of Bobby Sands, O'Hara, Hughes, MacCreesh, and Joe MacDonnell, who died yesterday after a sixty-day hunger strike yesterday, enjoying the approval and support of Irish Catholics and much of European and world public opinion.
That's what the word "victim" means.
Our imagination requires some sacrifices from the rich.
The Olympic campaigners from many countries who bravely made a tremendous personal sacrifice also believed that the community would live up to its promise.
That we impose heavy sacrifices on ourselves is of no use if our competitors exploit them for their own growth.
And the success of the Camp David Accord shows that, for the first time in history, the military victors have made material sacrifices for peace to come.
That action, it must be said, will require great sacrifices, especially from the public and workers, victims who appear to be hated unless they find their justification in the efficiency of the installations and a sufficient balance between the surplus and deficit of production and consumption per capita of each Member State.
Third, account must be taken of the great efforts and sacrifices that Luxembourg has made since the beginning of the steel crisis, that is, since 1975, for the restructuring of its steel industry.
Enlargement would pose a dramatic threat to Spanish fisheries and even this sacrifice could not prevent our production capacity from being significantly curtailed.
Considerable concern was voiced against the fact that victims - because victims were eventually required - would have to be treated equally by farmers in all countries.
We declare that we do not stand with our backs to the wall and do not need to impose new sacrifices on small and medium-sized farmers, and we can do it differently.
The Agriculture Ministers were realistic and I know that all our farmers will be prepared to make some sacrifices to promote the long-term viability and stability of the common agricultural policy.
However, the victims must be evenly distributed among the Member States and I strongly oppose that British farmers should fare worse than their European counterparts.
Considering that we must all equally participate in the happy and unpleasant events of the Community and that it now requires sacrifices to get the economy started again, we accept the price increase proposals in the Woltjer report.
Members of the EPP even go so far as to demand a fair distribution of victims in the resolution they have signed with others.
We must also remember that had the democratic parties of Europe been vigilant and determined, this sacrifice of so many might not have been necessary.
However, these efforts will have to be continued for some time, as otherwise all the sacrifices that have hitherto been made, especially at workplaces, would have been meaningless.
A civilized state must avoid the victim of bystanders.
The economic losses, the number of human victims in firefighting, the costs are so high that they can no longer be borne by individuals, by the autonomous communities, by the city and local governments and thus lead to serious economic shocks.
It goes without saying that the abovementioned reduction has resulted in the sacrifice of several important parts of the program, notably aviation research.
Therefore it would be unfair to remember only one part of the victims and leave the other part unmentioned.
Now anyone who has a bit of common sense knows that you have to be able to make compromises and make sacrifices if you live in twelfths.
Through this sacrifice, they effectively succeeded in shaking up the international conscience and sparking a wave of solidarity with the Afghan people, culminating in that victory.
But in the name of what goal are we asking for all these great efforts, all these upheavals, all these sacrifices?
In line with these efforts, producers outside the Community should make similar sacrifices in order to achieve a more stable equilibrium on world markets.
The Polish people, suffering for years from the shortage and shortage of basic necessities, have just launched an ambitious restructuring process and economic reforms that will require further effort and sacrifice for this courageous and patient people.
The families of the employees of Sellafield are now required to make an extreme sacrifice.
Only then will all the soldiers of Europe whose blood, as an invisible ornament for the victims of the past, wet the threshold of every house in the area and drench every plot in fields, meadows and gardens, only then will all these fallen soldiers be able to rest in peace!
On the contrary, they would increase social and national sacrifices, especially for the weakest nations.
They worked generation after generation and made heavy sacrifices.
It will be argued that every country must make sacrifices to build a well-organized, integrated and efficient community, both the small and the large.
Pakistan is a country that has already made great sacrifices in the Afghan war with the admission of millions of refugees.
Beyond these very general plans, we should not forget that there are special cases, such as the case of Poland, which as a whole has already been the demonstration of what our world politics will look like and what our true intentions are by the fact that the Poles were the first to initiate this process of democratization and were willing to make sacrifices for it.
Parliament should approve measures that are conciliatory to the US but demand a major sacrifice from European agriculture.
The sinking of fishing boats by submarines can be avoided, and I urge the Commission and the governments of the Member States to agree immediately on appropriate procedures to ensure that the "Antares" crew were the last victims our fishermen brought to the Cold War.
We knew that war is the victim of politics.
I believe that the Council must be careful to do something for the minorities that remain, even in a smaller Yugoslavia, and in particular that the victims in Bosnia-Herzegovina need attention.
The one net rule proposed will impose different hardships and sacrifices on fishermen in different regions and waters that will not be justified by the bank.
While this is a unique achievement in the history of international maritime affairs (thanks to the self-sacrifice of the crew and perfect coordination of the rescue operations by the captain in exceptionally difficult weather conditions, there was not a single victim), the intentional defamation was guided by low motives of unfair competition.
We will all have to make sacrifices in our way of life, in production and consumption.
Secondly, to strengthen the principle of safety and environmental protection, to raise standards and European and international controls throughout the cycle, from shipbuilding to ports and shipping, which is crucial to halt the negative spiral that has led to more frequent and serious accidents in recent years and to prevent fierce competition, which increasingly suffers from quality and safety.
Therefore, both Moroccan authorities and the general public have used their connection with the community as an essential element in their internal political discussion because they were able to "sell" their own people, so to speak, that it would be necessary to take those sacrifices for a more stable and better future.
I wish governments would take an example from those who show greater commitment and sacrifice in the face of such a human tragedy.
But it is a question of whether we have the means to implement our goals and whether we have the courage to explain to our respective populations what sacrifices they must make so that we can use sufficient resources to achieve our goals.
Of course, the necessary restructuring can not be guided by selfishness, but we must start with a clear stance taken by the Commission so that the victims of the social partners and the investment efforts of recent decades will not have been in vain.
In my country, beef is the most important agricultural export product - no other product has that significance - and because we export 80% of our total beef production, the whole GATT problem has enormous weight for us, and it is quite certain that we have to pay more than the sacrifices already made in the CAP.
The rehabilitation of the market and the balance between supply and demand are to be found in the production restriction, even if this solution is difficult in view of the victims involved.

Blocking Critics on Facebook: Do not apply for a public office if you can not handle the fueling of voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it was not long before the newspapers beat him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
He scolded the review, sure.
But he has not silenced his critics.
For in 1783 Washington said: "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, we are led to slaughter like sheep."
That brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have commented on their official Facebook page.
And that's why the American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a backlash with "Well, and?".
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it is important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is surprisingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in leading his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very adept at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents and play his hairless head after chemo on his side.
Therefore, obstruction of people who come to the governor's side - which is a public forum called official and of employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people whipping the whip online.
The post office talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his mail and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., Was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other breaking news," she wrote in the comment section of The Post.
"I also do not appreciate this idea, if a number of people comment on the same topic, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor's staff described as a "concentrated spam attack" would probably be called "advocacy" by others.
The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It's a lot cleaner than in the past, if you'd done the same thing by sending people to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or arrest and silence protesters.
But that's exactly what is happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for verbally abusing Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on this issue was in Virginia last week.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for its use of Facebook and Twitter.
That should not be that hard.
In the time of Washington, the time of affordable postage had a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers suggested his leadership.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius wrote all the letters to newspapers that downed Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his position on the Amity Treaty, trade, and shipping with Britain overcame his office, according to historical documents collected by the George Washington Project's online papers.
But he did not silence her.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses form the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
One week after a preliminary settlement was announced, the two banks said that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common stock at the unified price of $ 25.25, for a total of $ 3 billion.
The assumed price is less than 19% of the price of the share on 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $ 6 billion in the purchase of convertible shares, which will provide them with a 10% return and can be resold for $ 31.25.
The past few weeks have been tough for the group, which has seen its share price fall by half, while the price of insurance against insolvency skyrocketed.
This price fell on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.

Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comfort over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
Nordire, who led left to the finals next year at Archerfield before losing to Paul Eales, joins the new venue and serves as a tournament ambassador on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I saw the Renaissance Club being built, and we see how he achieves his fame with this event," Rafferty said.
"Players will see this course at its best, it's in great shape.
Jerry did a great job fixing this place.
He is an avid proponent of this game and is proud of his achievement here.
This is a great showcase for this course. "
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending his championship for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"That really feels special," said the Southport-based player.
"I could not defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program the year after I won it.

Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after celebrating his 50th birthday, returns to the action on Heimatboden.

"You want to do it well, but you also feel that extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I played solid golf.
I'm glad about how it happened. "
With the trio on the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.

Poverty and death in the Indonesian gold country
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she does not use a stove.
She rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai regency in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potato - locally referred to as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed with eager, unwashed hands and devoured.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she does her daily work, such as washing clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.

It is a rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was inducted in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote before the occupation forces through a public referendum.
An existing movement that stirred independence for Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which controls the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate, with a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire, followed by a morning 5-hour car ride.

Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's gold country.
The largest and most profitable goldmine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix's Freeport McMoran, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a 153,000-mile highland New Jersey-sized highland province.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper.
In addition, Papua owns an estimated $ 78 billion worth of wood resources.
However, these riches are a source of misery for the Papuans, who ensure that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a stifling presence.
A 2005 New York Times inquiry reported that Freeport paid nearly $ 20 million to local military and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $ 150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killing in Papua's tribal homeland in the 1970s became a genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.

"Migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables cheaper than the local Papuans in the traditional market," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to Jayapura, the provincial capital.
"The native Papuans - Papua's Mama Mama [the women] - have tasted their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised during his election campaign in 2014 to tackle the inequalities and violations in Papua.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on their way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, expecting to live up to our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
Indeed, only two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October, Paniai suffered a low point.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offense at their sound and later returned with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk, chased and beat the group with their rifle butts, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so severely that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - running in circles and imitating a birdsong - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began throwing stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, the soldiers were sent a command via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," says an official TIME document that was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the threat and called for calm and encouraged the crowd to return home.
Nobody was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overcrowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The native man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, only has one name, the TIME in a gloomy mood.
"I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him."
Chief Inspector of the Papua Police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because they were under attack.
"We need to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Papua police spokesman Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators have been killed and many more injured.
The news of the killings was 'filtered' to Jakarta the following day.
For three weeks, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to tackle the historic grievances in Papua.
"I want this case resolved immediately, so it will not happen again in the future," he said.
Security Secretary Wiranto said in October 2016 that he will set up an out-of-court mechanism for resolving historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed to tackling these violations, but there are processes that need to be gone through, "he said.
Then Wiranto retreated when he talked to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, who has been charged by the UN with "crimes against humanity" claiming more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody proxy vote in 1999, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such statements with grim disbelief.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress," says Yohanes.
"I am tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid to get shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military was looking for me," he says.
The shootings did not stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to send an unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company's location office.
The police said the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began firing at the crowd and killing one.
"We were so in a panic, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were rushed in here, according to the TIME.
"I hid in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and the police mobile brigade withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a source of trouble for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribesmen Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend Papuan rights by spurring on sporadic attacks and abductions by Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in recent years on the pretext of "securing national sovereignty."
Some never show up again.
Among the people in Papua Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
The people here cultivate everything they eat, especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the job of women who can work four or five fields of sweet potato.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between native Papuans and new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new air routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region tend to go to the better educated and wealthier migrants.
Papuans seldom have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain strained.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, even though they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Human Rights Watch Deputy Asia Director Phelim Kine, the promises made by Jokowi's election campaign to lift restrictions on coverage to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new threats to foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to Papua's immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shootings.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's allegations and told journalists in Jakarta, "Indonesia still has a democratic system and free media, making it difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
Local people want more foreign governments to take notice.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, locals broke their silence and urged him to "we want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting, but wanted to remain anonymous.
Indonesia will have another presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say they probably will not vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, in addition to being under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in miserable education and health services.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, regard their vote for Jokowi as a "guilt" that they have to repay.
"They do not need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai victims sacrificed one last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and military station.
They know that justice may never come to them, but at least they will not let the perpetrators forget their crimes.
"One member of our family was killed," says Yacobus, head down.
"What else can we do?"
Fires capture the 'Torch' skyscraper of Dubai for the second time
A fire found its through-book on Friday in one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter, 79-story building.
It's the second fire that sweeps through the skyscraper in just two years, which happens to be called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor, "recounted one resident named George, Reuters.
Dubai civil defense authorities said the firefighting units cleared the fire around 4:00 am local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it is working to provide housing for those affected.
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the cladding, the exterior cladding for decoration or insulation.
In the UK, the police said they believed that the system of isolation and cladding panels at London's Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed some 80 people.

No Davis Cup reform: Next best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) failed his general Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup singles for only two sets of winnings was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
Although often very long, but also therefore very much appreciated five-sentence classics thus remain the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of member states voted in favor of the reform, so ITF President David Haggerty's goal was narrowly missed.

We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions, "said Haggerty.

Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the assassination of Catalonia, several thousand dollars had been sent through a money transfer company, which had been "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "commando" that put an end to the lives of 106 people.
It is well known that the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls for the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead their group, the two players will fulfill the prescribed sanction at the next league match against the Auxerre and thus enter the next phase without any cards.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often found in the world of football.
The advantage is obviously that the players begin the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phones), with more than 6 billion units sold.

Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
"Jane, your little feet are naked, lie down to bed with me and cover you with my blanket."
On the other side of the square were tent stalls offering cotton goods, blankets, and stockings, and horse harnesses and piles of brightly colored ribbons fluttering in the wind.
He asked K. to hand him a blanket from the sofa.
K. fetched the blanket and said, "You are unnecessarily chilling yourself."
To throw off the blanket was very simple, it only needed to inflate a little and it fell by itself.
But then Mr. and Mrs. Samsa, each on his side, hurried out of bed, Mr. Samsa threw the blanket over his shoulders, Mrs. Samsa came out only in her nightgown, so they entered into Gregor's room.
In a small, dirty room, the painted paneling of which was badly spit-splattered, and through the thin wall of which one could hear a conversation next door, in a air filled with the stifling odor of unclean things, lay a body wrapped in a blanket on a bed drawn from the wall.
One arm of this body was above the ceiling, and the huge, rake-like hand was incomprehensibly attached to a thin, equally long, stick from start to middle.
It did not occur to him to ascertain all the details of the condition of the patient, to think about how this body lay there under the blanket, in which crooked posture these emaciated thighs and hips and those lean spines were stored and if it was not possible to better store them, to do something so that the patient would not be so bad if he did not feel better.
The wheelbarrow was brought in, the body laid on it, wrapped in a blanket and tied with ropes.
More than 1 in 5 US travelers bring banned items on the plane, a survey finds out
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 percent smuggled consciously or unconsciously prohibited items past the checkpoints of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent entering the plane while accidentally wielding forbidden knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they had discovered late that they had mistakenly traveled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers were more likely to disobey the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items intentionally bypassed by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent said they knowingly carried items with safety-conscious blades while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately put prohibited drugs on the plane.
The company said it interviewed travelers across the country to find out how many accidentally smuggled airport security and how many did it on purpose.
It is no surprise that the people most likely to carry contraband - knowingly or unknowingly - through safety were the ones who fly the most.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure about which liquids they are allowed to take or how much of it.
It comes as no surprise then that most of the items confiscated by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought TSA could view books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk does not care: tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel orders
Electro jack-of-all-trades Elon Musk likes to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has hitherto ignored that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-triumphant numbers to sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets Tesla CEO Elon Musk has revealed in the announcement of the recent quarterly balance sheet for the first time another, less glamorous figure: the cancellations of the new mass market model 3.
In recent months, Musk has frequently advertised more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, which is just starting to ship.
Now Musk admits: Of the total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics had repeatedly pointed out that they are only non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation, Tesla will pay the full amount of € 1,000 (US $ 1000 in the US and £ 1000 in the UK) "Reservation Deposit".
There are currently 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk admitted in a conference call with analysts.
That the cancellation of so far about twelve percent of all orders could be a problem, the Tesla boss does not believe.
His argument: The challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018 - all models taken together - it will be 500,000, 2020 one million.
The demand for it is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1,800 reservations per day.
If you order a "Model 3" today, you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand-new production lines that have never been tested in practice without major interruptions and maximum capacity utilization.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
But if it comes to major delays, then the non-binding nature of the reservations could be a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company can not prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in droves.
EPA chief Pruitt withdraws due to delaying the Obama Era's rules on reducing emissions
One day after he was sued by fifteen states, the chief environmental officer, Scott Pruitt, rescinded his earlier decision to delay implementation of the Obama era's rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency responded to the needs of state environmental agencies more responsively than previous administrations.
He did not mention the lawsuit filed against his previous position in a federal appeals court.
It's about a deadline for states on 1 October to meet the 2015 ground-level ozone standards.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering in local decisions or hampering economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's Prosecutor before his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of more stringent environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly resorted to blocking or delaying regulations that the chemical industry and fossil fuel industry oppose.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for Pruit's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPO administrator exceeded his authority when attempting to delay the implementation of an Obama Administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his turnaround in ozone standards would simply reinforce the EPA's willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Among past administrations, the EPO has often failed to meet deadlines for implementation, waiting to be charged by activist groups and others, and agreeing on a deadline for implementation," said Pruitt, who sued the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and the authority that we have. "
Nonetheless, the EPO's opinion stated that at some point Pruitt will use "his powers of delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules are "based on sound policies and best available information".
Congress Republicans are pushing for a broader revision of ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is intended to delay implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intended to maintain legal pressure.
"The reversal of the EPA - after our lawsuits - is a major asset to the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that is pouring into their communities," said Schneiderman.
New York joined in this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone is created when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people, contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered about Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It's worrying how much pressure it takes to get that sensible step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the ideological crusade of the Trump government to adore polluters and their special interests."
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an ailing move to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.

Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilary's Church
750 years of St. Hilary's Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, a serenade will be invited to the old cemetery site in Tumlingen on Sunday 16 July at 16.30.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilary complex is a popular place to stay.
The visitors of the sixth charity serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in town have made Tumlingen's friends and supporters their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique village gem".
In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first documented in the Württembergisches Urkundenbuch: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church on Tumlingen including the bailiwick" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 marks silver.
According to the document, Tumlinger Berg also had a manorial court in addition to the former parish church, to which the church or the patronage law belonged, and not vice versa.
So people lived there too.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, the "Unterdorf" and the upper village, which can still be recognized today in the townscape of Tumlingen, was the third, the noble settlement center of the village.
Old maps from the period around the year 1600 underpin these historical facts.
The patronage law originated from the early medieval own church law.
A gentleman who built a church, equipped it and occupied it with a pastor, remained owner of this church and could also inherit this own church.
Associated with this was the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two burst on Christmas 1673.
The newly purchased bell then sounded for the first time in 1692, but later had to be delivered in World War II in 1942.
In the Thirty Years War (1616-1648), the windows were smashed and the bell ropes stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out of the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the final resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilarius church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
To prevent a disaster, the tower was demolished.
Only the still present tower dwarf remained as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Schaffigen Pensioners" are the followers of Dieter Dockhorn's Hilarius plant.
As an organizer invite the friends and supporters Tumlingens on Sunday, July 16, the sixth Serenade on the old cemetery to St. Hilariuskapelle.
It is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Mayor Hartmut Romann speaks the closing word.
The program starts at 16.30.
Admission is from 15.30 clock.
The end of the serenade will be followed by a drink in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view across meadows to the forest," the organizers point out the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingen are particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini confirms.
Association wants to have approval of wind turbines checked
"Boisheim fights back" sees no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the district administrator.
The association "Boisheim defends itself" has asked district administrator Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his permission for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette no wind power plants could have been approved, since at that time in Viersen only at the city border to Schwalmtal a wind power concentration zone existed.
Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are possible in principle, but at the same time the concentration zone excludes the use of wind energy for the rest of the urban area.
Such zones are to prevent a "clearing" of the landscape.
The city of Viersen had decided a few days earlier by a change in land use plan, a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nice - but had not approved the district government Dusseldorf, because of a form error.
"Due to the lack of planning law prerequisites, the granted permit decision is still unlawful and therefore also to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim defends itself".
Current state of affairs: The City Council has again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer break, a permit from the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "At this point, the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded under planning law".
The circle confirms the receipt of the request.
"The letters have been received by Viersen County since last week," a spokesman said.
The district is taking this opportunity to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not expected to stop the process.
With regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the district on Thursday did not want to comment on the content of the argumentation of the association "Boisheim defends itself".
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning the construction of four 200-meter-high wind turbines on an area on Boisheimer Nette.
Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65-hectare site.
The erection of the four wind turbines is expected to meet the electricity needs of around 11,400 households - equivalent to around one fifth of the electricity needs of all Viersen households.
The NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersens city council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg.
'It's ours, it's our future,' he added, after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The emphasis on civilian character and form of association thus does not merely serve to circumvent legal hurdles that might arise in the course of entry in court - it is also a political strategy.

City and retailers plan "home shopping" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are in September to rediscover the shopping in the city center.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8th and 9th to lure the locals to go shopping in the city center.
As announced by the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, the "home shopping weekend" should sensitize the customers for what offers their own city away from the usual supermarket goods.
Accordingly, a market is planned with regional providers, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, domestic companies should present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops in the city center are invited to "midnight shopping".
The action is aimed not only at residents of the city and the nearer region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags that refer to the action weekend, so Christian King.
Municipal administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Thus, the trade association and the city go into another stage of the project "Attractive downtown".
These include new offerings such as the first "Active Day" to the Fountain Festival, including Sunday for sale, talks with all tradespeople and hosts to encourage them to participate actively.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potentials should be re-opened or reopened.
These include spa guests and tourists.
But many locals would have lost sight of downtown shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to help revitalize the city center - including landlords, businesses throughout the city, and clubs.
It was a matter of overcoming the lethargy with a network, which was partly spreading, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, director of the IHK center in Mühlhausen, announced that five of the Thuringian cities are participating in the nation's third "home shopping" day.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local commerce and highlight its importance to the common good of our cities," says Streich.
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct environment with his buying behavior.

The essence of the "this time is everything else" syndrome lies in the assumption that crises only affect others.
Behind this is the assumption that behind the longest chain is a majority of users.

Under the optimistic assumption that government spending and philanthropy will double in the medium term, the volume of private investment will need to increase by a factor of 20-30 in order to meet the required financial needs.
Assuming that suppliers' added value falls in Switzerland, the purchases made by the big banks generate value added of around CHF 2.4 billion and 19 275 jobs.
That the relatively inexpensive pillow has a future is a real assumption:
And with this assumption, the stricter capital requirements, which will apply to Swiss banks from 2018, have already been taken into account.
Assuming that the CHF will still deviate slightly from the current level, we are lowering our forecast for GDP growth in Switzerland for 2015 from 1.6 percent to 0.8 percent.

Trump put pressure on Mexico for leaked transcripts of phone calls because of the payment of the border wall
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by The Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump, in a telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, called for ceasing to publicly state that he would not pay for a proposed boundary wall.
The US President cursed him for publicly denouncing the wall and reportedly told him, "You can not tell the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign promising to build a wall on the southern border of the US and vowed to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released, revealing a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that trafficking for the US would take refugees who emigrated to Australia "ridiculously", "lousy" and "stupid" and that insisting on the trade brokered by the Obama administration would make him look like a "dork" after proposing a ban on relocating refugees to the US.
Mr. Trump ended the call after telling Mr. Turnbull, "This is the most unpleasant phone call for the whole day."
I was escorted to a tavern where the conductor asked me to sit down to dine, but left me alone in a large room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier hanging from the ceiling, and at the top of the wall a small red gallery with various musical instruments on it.
And all this you can see by the glow of an oil lamp hanging from the ceiling and a bright fireplace beside my coat and hat, my muff and umbrella lying on the table, trying to recover from the stiffness and stupor of the heat of the stove, which had brought me a sixteen-hour journey in cold October weather, leaving Lowton at four o'clock in the morning, and the city clock of Millcote was just eight o'clock.
After walking along the long carpeted gallery, I descended the hall, where I stood for a minute, looking at some copper engravings on the walls, still remembering one of them, one looking at a gloomy-looking man in a cuirass, the other a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace, a bronze lamp hanging from the ceiling, a large, old wall clock whose oak case had been strangely carved and blackened by time and ebony.
She climbed down from her chair and came to me to sit on my lap, then seriously folded her small hands, threw back her curls, fixed her eyes on the ceiling of the room, and began to sing a tune from some opera.
It was a large, stately room, with purple furniture and curtains, a Turkish carpet, walnut-clad walls, a large multicolored window, and a richly carved ceiling.
I still see her in her raging passion when we pushed her to the limit - she shed our tea, crumbled our sandwiches, threw our books up to the ceiling, and made a jumbled mess with the ruler and the writing desk, the fireside and the tongs.
Right, and faster than she expected: before she had half-drunk the vial, she felt her head bump against the ceiling, and had to stoop quickly so as not to break her neck.
Through the cracks of the wood, the sun's rays pierced the tiles with long, thin needles, or they split at the edges of the furniture and swirled up to the ceiling.
"If you only knew," she went on, flinging her beautiful eyes, from which tears rolled, to the ceiling, "what I've dreamed of!"
The interior of the hut was as dilapidated as the old one, its walls whitewashed, the beams of the ceiling blackened, the chimney plunging, spider webs hanging in every corner, a row of wobbly tables and broken stools in the center, a dirty child sitting in the ashes, and in the background a staircase, or rather a wooden ladder, leading up to a trapdoor in the ceiling.
In this passionate declaration of love, the gypsy woman sent a look of heavenly happiness to the dirty blanket that represented heaven here.
The young girl shuddered, her eyes raised to the ceiling, sunk backwards and trembling all over, under his kiss.
At a sign from Charmolue, she was put back on the bed, and two rough fists attached to her delicate body the thong hanging from the ceiling.
A crowd of people-no-one caring for the entrants-filled a medium-sized, two-story room, which was just off the ceiling surrounded by a gallery that was also completely occupied, and where people could only stand bent over and hit the ceiling head and back.
But not she shrieked, but the man, he had pulled his mouth wide and looked up at the ceiling.
Although there was no direct access to light, it was not completely dark, because some departments had against the corridor instead of uniform wooden walls bare, but up to the ceiling reaching wooden lattice through which penetrated some light and through which one could see individual officials, as they wrote at tables or stood almost at the grid and through the gaps, the people watching in the corridor.
He liked to hang on the top of the ceiling in particular, it was very different from lying on the floor, breathing freely, a light swinging through the body, and in the almost happy absent-mindedness in which Gregor was up there, to his own surprise, he let go and slapped the floor.
"She'll go under the ceiling and against the wall."

Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists re-launch racist lynching as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of onlookers in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled toward Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with rifles stepped out to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit - took a long drag on his cigar and peered through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates hovered in fear.
"We want that - Roger!" Roared the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams tore the silence as a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Luckily, this horrible scene, which was played on July 22, is just a reenactment.
But when a noose is thrown around Roger's neck, almost all of the audience sighs in real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one was ever charged with the murders.
"It's unbelievable that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the re-enactment.
"It's a smudge on a story, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former state congressman from Georgia and a civil rights activist for life.
For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want law enforcement, we want the termination, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he said.
"We can not achieve healing and reconciliation until we receive justice."
A coroner places a sheet over the body of one of the Moore Ford Lynch victims on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process.
But nobody was ever charged.
Although the suspects have been on the loose for decades, civil rights activists say the dual motivation for lynching across the city has always been well-known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling enabled black people in Georgia to vote in the primary election campaign for the first time in the summer.
Around the same time as the election, black farm tenant Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight, allegedly for a woman, according to the FBI.
Brooks said the rumor in town was that Hester slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was wearing was not her husband's.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $ 600 to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was escorted to the jail by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they moved away from the jail and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the killings," concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local prosecution who was not only involved in the killings, removing evidence and covering up the identity of witnesses."
Brooks puts it even more succinctly.
"It was a suffrage massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community:" If you register and if you vote, this will happen to you. "
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has directed the annual reenactment of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Her portrayal is graphic, poignant, and grounded in a kind of profound racism many believe he no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We do not want to talk about lynching, because then we will face its ugliness in all of us," she said.
"But I can not build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I've been through."
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of the blacks - crowded into a room, listening as Greene began a well-rehearsed overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Green's co-director here.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role never gets easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Marbaugh said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to go back to those times."
Across the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcom shouting at Hester and pressuring him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, he's leaving my property!"
Rascona returns the fire.
There is a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) burst out laughing.
Greene laughs loudest.
"What ?!" Rascona asked.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," Greene said, still chuckling.
"I just do not think white people said 'he'-he'd then."
"Yes," joked one of the other black actors.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R.'."
And this is exactly where the energy shifts in the room, a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting it right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely nobody laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman dressed in a mourning dress stands over the corpses of the actors and performs Billie Holidays mourning eulogy "Strange Fruit".
Her voice breaks at every other word.
About a hundred meters behind, a group of about four dozen spectators wiped sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is divided almost equally between black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just come down the street.
They have all experienced Georgia's oppressive humidity for almost eight hours as Brooks pilgrimages to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
To this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels spooky.
When the last notes of the song come to an end, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpses.
Children squat on their heads, registering the fake blood and the silent bodies and whispering to each other.
"They're not really dead," a small boy mumbles as if he wants to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his teammates and then breaks down in her arms crying, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know that's not in your heart.
You did that for a reason. "
Later, the audience sits down with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chattered about the reenactment with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that left the feeling of the performance.
"It's hard to hear those terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me makes me believe that the lynching is still going on," she added, "today it's just called a police shootout."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, he eats and recalls the civil rights.
He said he had already started planning the performance next year.
"The reenactment is in some ways inspiring, because it describes the horror of what we endured, but it's also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's like, if we do not learn anything from it, then it can happen again.
Who does not study his own history, who does not know his own history, is doomed to repeat it. "
"Götterdämmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth installment of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf also focuses on a colorfully frivolous staging in front of a gigantic, six-story backdrop.
The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows either a shabby street corner including the remains of the wall and kebab in Berlin, a "plastic and Elaste" logo from the GDR era or the New York Stock Exchange.
In front of it parks an open Mercedes vintage car, in which the Rhine daughters pose as Rockergirls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - that runs through his "ring" staging.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully, as in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduce her Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), drag a corpse into the trunk in Hollywood style and give the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen, which surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutally the scene, as he kills Siegfried.
Later also Gunther (Markus Eiche) has to believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with loud applause.
Stormy celebrated Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who bowed modestly and forming his hands to the Merkel diamond.
There is great applause for the Festival Orchestra, which shows itself on stage for the first time - in light of the great heat again in casual casual wear.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his directorial team was eagerly awaited.
Had he still had to endure a shrill whistling concert in 2013, there was great rejoicing five years later, in which the occasional "Buh" calls went down.
Festival director Katharina Wagner should have been happy about it.
"You notice that the audience has grown together with the" Ring "in a way," she had said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience not only had some form of peace with Castorf, but also an understanding of his point of view.
I draw a positive conclusion.
Almost everyone - except companies like ExxonMobil or US Vice President Dick Cheney and their purchased henchmen and misguided henchmen - understands that carbon dioxide escapes into the atmosphere when humans burn hydrocarbons, and that the CO2 acts like a huge blanket that absorbs the infrared radiation from below and heats the earth.
Sufficient brightness, good contrast, flicker and anti-reflection of the screen surface as well as high resolution and correct dimensioning of the characters are important for the readability of the presentation.
The finer the resolution of the screen, that is, the more "pixels" per character available, the better the readability of the information.
Graphics screens usually have a higher resolution than screens designed to display only letters and numbers.
In practice, you can determine the effect of resolution and rendering quality by examining whether or not certain critical characters are easily confused, and pairs of easily confused characters are:
In her motion for a resolution, our group calls for the release of Souha Bechara and the other political prisoners and the dissolution of the Khiam camp.
Studies on the influence of topographical databases on the performance of external / internal propagation models in terms of data type, format (raster, vector) and resolution (in area element and in height);
Guidelines for quality control / quality assurance, such as camera quality, spatial and temporal resolution, etc., may be suggested if they prove helpful to this action.
Required configuration: PC with Pentium 100 Mhz (minimum) - 16 MB RAM (minimum) - CDROM reader with quadruple speed (minimum) - 15 MB free space on the hard disk - super screen VGA 256 color (resolution 640 χ 480) Windows 95.
Other higher resolution databases can be used within the case studies.
Among the international projects at regional and continental level, the CORA and CORINE Phare projects at EUA, which produce land cover information for Europe using TM images that achieve high resolution and accuracy, are particularly noteworthy.
They do not contain full resolution remote sensing images at this stage, although some inferior quality samples are available.
The five basic characteristics that describe land cover (woody, grassy, bare soil, artificial (structures), waters) can easily be determined using Earth observation data (both low and high resolution) over large areas for mapping purposes.
This option allowed the creation of a high quality map base with an expected geometrical accuracy of 2.5m (RMS) and a resolution of 1m.
In this case, with a geometrical resolution of 1m, each point can be uniquely located except for objects whose resolution would be less than 1 meter.
The rule of thumb mentioned above must be revised if the geometric resolution of the image is low, that is, if a considerable proportion of the objects whose area you want to estimate is destroyed by the presence of mixed pixels.
In contrast, in the field of agrometeorological models and methods for vegetation monitoring with satellites of medium resolution, a lot of development and research work has to be done.
Currently GEOSTAT's geographic information system not only contains raster and dot data with a resolution of 1 ha but also various vector files.The GEOSTAT project comprises project organization and management and two project units: the service center and the EDP group.
Integration, management and maintenance of various geocoded, spatially relevant data available in the Swiss Federal Administration, which is designed to cover the entire country and have a spatial resolution of 100 m, which corresponds to a map scale of 1:25 000;
Data on the areal development of a smaller number of land use categories (possibly 20 or less) with a lower spatial resolution and accuracy could be published once or twice a year to fill in the data gap resulting from the aerial photography area statistics being compiled only every 12 years.
The remote sensing provides the data for geometric meshes of different sizes depending on the resolution of the sensor (pixels).
In addition to the feature program, the scale and the geometric resolution (smallest different spatial unit), the nomenclature and the periodicity of the survey play a decisive role.
With regard to the selection of sample fields, however, it was shown in the first study year 1990 that very small fields can hardly be made visible in the satellite image given the relatively low geometric resolution of currently available image material (LANDSAT TM: 30 χ 30 m).
For the calculations, six of the seven spectral channels of the LANDSATA shots were used in July 1990 and April and July 1991, and the thermal channel was excluded because of its low resolution (120 χ 120 m2) causing too many mixing pixels at the parcel boundaries.
However, the intended improvement of the spectral resolution in LANDSAT 6 will in any case have a positive effect on the usability of smaller training fields.
Therefore, satellite images with higher resolution (SPOT, LANDSATTM 6 with 15 χ 15 m2) should be available as soon as possible and at the same time it should be examined whether sufficiently high coefficients of determination and satisfactory confidence intervals of the yield estimation can be obtained by including additional statistical and / or meteorological parameters in the correlation calculations.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, with the support of the ITA consortium, began in 1987 to estimate land and crop yields from satellite data with high geometric and spectral resolution, complemented by land use survey sample data on 4 500 50 and 100 hectare land areas.
A first attempt to combine this survey with satellite data took place in 1981 with a picture of Landsat MSS, but did not produce convincing results, which was attributed to the insufficient resolution of the MSS sensor.
It has also been found that for regression estimation, ground data collected by points as well as segments can be used, provided one has a satellite with sufficient resolution, and SPOT appears to be better suited for this application than Landsat ™.
A finer spatial resolution is needed to investigate environmental impacts.
Different applications in different geographic areas require different resolution and accuracy in the estimation of the geophysical parameters.
For example, in thirty minutes, geostationary satellites can capture an area of one fifth of the Earth's surface and deliver images at a resolution of 5 or 2.5 km.
It mentions some of the problems encountered in the project, including the difficulty of obtaining consistent multitemporal data, the problem of developing a consistent and generally accepted classification, and the limitations of the scale and the resolution of other data sets with which land use data must be combined.
PC with Pentium 100 MHz (minimum) - 16 MB RAM (minimum) - 4x speed CD-ROM drive (minimum) - 15 MB free hard disk space - Screen: Super VGA, 256 colors (resolution 640 χ 480) - Windows 95.
By developing a method by which microradiographs of high resolution can be produced from irradiated shell grains, the quality of the post-irradiation studies has been improved.
The resolution of SEM is about 20 nm, the upper limit here is at least 1000 microns.
The main obstacle to traditional video telephony is the bandwidth: with the conventional switched telephone lines, it is still difficult to transfer a picture of good resolution with sufficiently high repetition rate to really give the impression of movement.
The imager developed by IMEC provides better resolution in the center of the image (corresponding to the fovea) than at its edge (retina), using a very limited number (8013) of pixels.
With the EISS browser, images can be found and viewed at low resolution.
Equipped with the right signal converter, every TV set bought today can receive digital programs, but not with the high resolution.
BARON's Stereoscopic Projection Table features crystal-clear images of high-resolution computer workstations and PC graphics cards.
The resulting demand has led to the development of high resolution CCD color image devices.
However, many users use the range of IVP products of slower, lower-resolution devices.
SPA has high resolution, low time constant, easy compatibility with computer control and the ability to work within a wide temperature range
As a mechatronic device, the SPA effector / sensor offers some desirable characteristics such as high resolution, low time constant, easy compatibility with computer control and the ability to operate over a wide temperature range and is suitable for the development of intelligent mechanisms.
The correlation spectrometers use the correlation technique to improve the resolution otherwise limited by the specific long reactor pulse.
At the heart of the project is "MGW," an "intelligent media streaming server," which allows content to be distributed to separate networks by changing the audio / video bit rate, resolution, and format.
The Space Apphcations Institute, a member of the European Commission's Joint Research Center (JRC), has published a report outlining a new methodology for imaging Europe's forests using an Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR).
The measuring device is based on the use of a supraspectral sensor with appropriate spatial resolution, which is potentially supplemented by an infrared sensor with a lower resolution;
This will be the first time that such a "snapshot" of Planet Earth has been put together in terms of resolution and capture / coverage.
The themes of the projects presented were: ways to support the Altimetri on climate forecasting, marine pollution monitoring, use of Earth observation to assess the health of European forests, the PELCOM project, which aims to produce an "updatable" map of Europe with a resolution of 1 km, assess the impact of UV radiation and monitor ozone levels.
The data should be obtained from the output of meteorological models and low resolution satellite data.
The third lot involves the management of a processing chain for low-resolution satellite data.
Operating the MARS Data includes data derived from a global circulation model, low resolution satellite data and derived products, mapping and providing the results, updating the associated MARS database.
Siemens was concerned with data quality because fixed models require much higher resolution and accuracy than normal scans.
And finally, it has commissioned the École Nationale Supérieure de Physique de Strasbourg (ENSPS) to develop a high-speed memory card that can store 2000 images at the full resolution of 512 χ 512 pixels.
The resolution of this vectorial equation according to the coordinate directions leads to the accelerations acting in x, y and z directions.
A section of a measurement record is reproduced in Fig. 43, where twice the signal frequency, one of which is high-resolution, is recorded.
An advantage of the empirical versus the theoretical determination of categories is that it is thus possible to determine their general applicability and reliability in resolving ambiguities in real texts.
The resolution is again in the source language, and when translating into multiple languages at the same time, individual meanings can only be entered at specific points in these programs.
This could lead to an increase in the resolution of the ultrasonic test.
For reasons of higher accuracy (greater resolution) in the hybrid computer simulation and uniform normalization of the entire road for any pass schedules, the coefficients of the linearized rolling mill model for setpoint deviations were calculated and multiplied by amplitude normalization factors.
Full volume scanning with a high resolution radar (such as Chilbolton's) would take too long.
Of these data, those with the low resolution (10 s) were only used to examine long durations (greater than 32 sec), while those with the high resolution were used to describe the process as a whole.
The shortcomings that exist there, such as insufficient resolution and too long response times, are currently a major obstacle to including certain innovation-relevant information in databases.
The IRSID research project (47) uses a new generation of X-ray photodiode array radiation detectors that allow the simultaneous acquisition of a large number of measurement points with the same accuracy but finer resolution than existing measurement devices.
However, the use of the new resolution has the advantage that one can now recognize the differences in the surface temperature over the length of the traversed absorber.
The resolution of this model of price flexibility is achieved by balancing supply and demand.
The resolution of the model causes us to set three marginal rates.
The improvement of non-destructive methods with high spatial and temporal resolution that characterize, for example, bioactive interfaces (structure, function, stability) and the design of miniaturized transducers for devices based on biological function.
The ability to pair high and low resolution images simultaneously recorded from the same platform allows a much more accurate analysis.
A zoom effect with high resolution and the same spectral bands make it possible to better describe virtually every pixel.
The radiometric resolution was adjusted to measure the differences caused by the growth of the soil - and not just the large contrasts required by meteorologists.
Using low-resolution (1km) low-resolution (1km) images from the US Weather Observatory satellites, the JRC has compiled a map of all tropical forests in the world.
This inventory was only possible due to several technological developments in the field of radar wave probes (microwave probes) with low spatial resolution.
Their goal is to track the evolution of tropical forest areas almost simultaneously through the combined use of both low and high resolution images.
The high-resolution images then allow the affected region to be analyzed in detail and the size of the existing forest areas to be precisely determined.
A new kind of sonar • In the marine sector and within the framework of the ACID (Acoustic Imaging Development) project, a new generation of sonars has been developed, the special feature of which is that they provide images whose resolution is independent of the distance between the detector and the target object.
(Dissolution by the Annual General Meeting)
By scanning documents, the contents of paper pages can be saved as a computer file that contains an image of the source document at a specific resolution.
The resolution of a scanner is expressed in "dots per inch" (dpi).
Color scanners can currently easily achieve a resolution of 300 or 600 dpi.
The resolution of a fax scanner is much lower (100 to 200 dpi).
Due to the low resolution and poor print quality, optical character recognition for faxes is often difficult to apply.
Henning T. tears two cables from the stereo, knots them into a noose and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He called on governments in the region to commit to sustainable land use and sustainable investments that are not at the expense of the natural resources of Southeast Asia - mainly forests.
Some investors seem to bet on safe assets such as gold.
On average, investors in Europe hold over 34 percent short-term investments compared to 14 percent in the US.
For this reason, short-term investments in Europe are more than twice as heavily weighted.
Especially for small countries such as Switzerland, where the possibilities of diversification of investments and the selection of securities are limited due to the size of the domestic capital market, investing in securities abroad is of great importance.
In recent years, the economy has benefited greatly from the global demand for US assets, especially debt in the form of securities that financed a large current account deficit.
The entire financial universe - investments and trading - has been increasingly covered for 100 years like hardly any other financial market:
In the past, sustainable investment was all about filtering out assets in "poorly respected" industries such as alcohol, weapons and tobacco.
Such investments as well as participations or cash reserves form the asset side.
What about the currency risk - should investments be hedged?
In a broad comparison, we therefore assume that the risk-return ratio of investments in the emerging markets will improve in the future.
Investment guru Jim Rogers once said investing in the emerging markets would be the best way to buy what the emerging markets are buying, which is commodities.
A new era of sustainable investments
Initial approaches only excluded investments in "sin sectors" such as alcohol, weapons or tobacco.
At Credit Suisse, we define sustainable investment as the explicit recognition that environmental, social and governance factors can influence companies' ability to generate long-term returns.
Our research methodology for sustainable investing begins with an analysis of sustainability opportunities and risks that can fundamentally influence a company's ability to secure its profitability.
Why do sustainable investments and sustainable companies today attract so much more public attention than they did ten years ago?
Disasters such as Fukushima or Deepwater Horizon make investors wonder how their investments affect the environment and society.
The market turbulence of recent times has also increased the awareness of sustainable investments.
Do you expect the trend towards sustainable investments to be limited to niche areas such as environmental technology, or will consideration of ESG criteria become a permanent trend among investors worldwide?
We want to offer investors our know-how in the field of sustainable investments, play a visible and important role in this, and at the same time participate in the steady growth in this area.
in investment and banking products, in the advisory process, in the instruments we offer and, most importantly, in our employees, "added Pauli.
"Returns are important, no question," says Pauli, "but good advice, including a clear reasoning for or against an investment, is just as important."
"Investing has become a very complex affair," explains Nicole Pauli, "and at some point product specialists are required who have specific, detailed knowledge of an investment."
For example, the asset management specialists for funds in funds and alternative investments or the investment bankers for strategic decisions such as an initial public offering or a merger, and finally the private banking advisors for the management of private assets.
For example, the value investing goes to Benjamin Graham and David Dodd and published in 1934 investment standard work "Security Analysis" (German:
Speaking to John Maynard Keynes, supporters of the contrarian strategy say, "One of the basic principles of investing is to oppose the prevailing view, because if everyone agrees on the merits of an investment, it is inevitably too expensive and thus unattractive."
On the one hand, the increase in risk aversion, given the debt problems in Greece and Spain, would argue for an escape to safe assets.
On the other hand, from the perspective of a foreign investor, investing in Swiss francs would be a diversification in the portfolio.
In addition, cash flows into indexed products are entering a relatively illiquid market, forcing investors from passively managed mandates into investments at a yield level that we believe is not sustainable.
The real dimension was reflected in the publication of the Bank's third quarter 2011 results: The new Basel III rules would have more than doubled the risk-weighted assets (RWA) in investment banking, largely due to fixed income.
The lack of investment alternatives and the high level of liquidity in investors' deposits worldwide also argue in favor of investing in equities.
You make a decision (buy an investment) and hope for a positive effect (want to achieve a return).
It is a measure of the return fluctuations of a plant around its mean.
Very low risk instruments, such as most money market investments, receive a one, while high risk assets such as options receive a five.
This is particularly important given the current very unusual market environment for fixed income investing, which is characterized by exceptionally low yields and a lack of safe assets.
Investors who want to capitalize on the potential of the equity markets but are unwilling to bear all the associated risks may invest in convertible bonds.
Many founders are also looking at ways to turn some of their corporate assets into cash and diversify into unsecured and uncorrelated assets.
Long-term investments in the oil, mining, manufacturing and transportation sectors are more stable than those in equities and bonds currently being withdrawn from other emerging markets.
Responsible investments offer new opportunities
For example, the first comprehensive investment report from seven regions around the world from the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance (GSIA) in 2013 found that at least $ 13.6 trillion of professionally managed assets now use ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance, Environmental, Social and Governance) criteria to select and manage their investments when selecting and managing their investments.
This corresponds to around 22 percent of the assets under management in these regions and proves that sustainable investments in the regions studied have reached a critical mass overall.
The concluding panel discussion dealt with the central theme of "Impact Investing", ie investments that bring about social and / or ecological improvements in addition to their financial returns thanks to sustainable corporate growth.
Referring to the collapse of the Rana factory building in Bangladesh in April 2013, which claimed more than 1,100 fatalities and around 1,000 seriously injured workers, Oliver Niedermaier explained that long-term investors such as sovereign wealth funds, ultra high net worth individuals and pension funds consider this type of asset to be particularly attractive:
Responsible Investment (RI) or Responsible Investment is an investment approach that takes into account environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations in asset selection and management.
We have been able to quickly raise funds, especially for alternative investments, and now have to industrialize all processes - from marketing to sales.
Speaking of growth in alternative investments, what is the cause of this demand?
In my opinion, AM meets these needs with its world-class alternative and traditional investment products and strong multi-asset class solutions business.
How do you ensure a sound investment and risk management process?
What does this mean in terms of facilities?
The new, hand-picked investment themes and ideas from Credit Suisse's Investment Strategy & Research team have been developed to help you get the most out of your investment in the second half of 2014.
Giles Keating, Head of Research, explains the thinking behind the ideas and the impact of the plant.
"For example, European customers like to delegate their assets and often opt for wealth management mandates.
The third factor could play a role, although we have no explicit governmental requirements regarding investments.
Life insurance companies, such as pension funds, which have traditionally built heavily on fixed income, are facing problems.
Given their risk profile and also the investment guidelines (LOB), it will be difficult for these investors to increase their share of riskier assets such as equities or high yield bonds.
This deleveraging will result in market participants liquidating their emerging markets assets.
Exchanges today are owned by shareholders who expect a fair return on their investment.
The boom in 2001 was triggered by a lack of real estate supply, significant employment growth, an expansionary monetary policy and the trend of households to shift their investments from equities to residential real estate.
In addition to classic direct investment, there are a whole range of alternatives that avoid possible disadvantages of such an investment, such as low liquidity and lack of transparency.
To put it simply, I decide whether to invest more in bonds, equities, cash or alternative investments, as well as the allocation of various asset categories such as loans, hedge funds or private equity such as regions, countries and styles such as value stocks or growth stocks.
Today, he offers a range of options to cover the megatrends "Demographic developments", "Multipolar world" and "Sustainability" with a single investment.
That would be the right environment to deal intensively with systems that take these megatrends into account.
In fact, investing in countries with weaker economic growth has historically yielded high returns.
The primary investment theme for investing in India is consumption, ie investment in non-cyclical consumer goods, personal care products, electronic products, high-end goods such as cars and mobile phones or luxury goods.
Each profile specifies the ranges in which bonds, equities, alternative investments and currencies may move.
The American data gives a rough idea of the possible returns on investments in agricultural land.
Investment in agricultural land would have been a good admixture for most depots over the last two decades.
Only the right harvest year makes a fine wine from a good plant.
The report also provides valuable data for the important asset top-down analysis and puts current public debt concerns in the right context: it proves that the estimated $ 42 trillion of global public debt in 2009 is only one-fifth of the $ 195 trillion in household wealth worldwide, "said Giles Keating.
At the same time, they open up interesting opportunities for investments in companies benefiting from this development.
The Danish entrepreneur and venture capitalist Morten Lund learned this on his own, as a position of his portfolio with over 80 assets - the most famous of which was the Internet telephony and video software Skype - 2009 was worthless and took him to the entire fortune.
The development of exclusive offerings has resulted in new structured products, customized investments and new mutual funds, such as a $ 750 million loan fund.
We can help customers in all areas, from pure asset building to the stage when they need complex investment and investment solutions. "
"Our biggest competitors have been passive systems in recent years," explains Küffer.
He was involved in two companies and had made part of his investments by an IPO of both companies to money.
"It has happened that we have advised an international listed company on mergers and capital markets while offering personal investment or financial advice to the family holding company," says Fleuriot.
In general, therefore, it is fair to say that with the right advice and care, hedge fund investments are not necessarily more risky than traditional investments.
Alternative investments therefore remain an important part of any capital allocation.
Unlike in the 1990s, the minimum interest rate can no longer be achieved today with an almost risk-free investment such as Swiss federal bonds.
However, the investment of coupons and repayment amounts of the bonds at higher interest rates compensates for the market value loss in the long term.
However, in times of negative real interest rates, it can not be considered as an adequate investment for the medium and long term as the investor has to accept a real loss of wealth.
An expansion of the range of products and services in the areas of philanthropy, microfinance, sustainable investments and so-called "impact investing" would enable Swiss banks to tap interesting new business areas.
However, against the background of latent and difficult to predict structural inflationary pressures, we are already increasingly turning to real assets.
Real investments form a cornerstone of our investment strategy.
The economic progress, the generous supply of liquidity to the central banks, the continued favorable or appropriate valuation of riskier assets and the still existing investment pressure should allow the financial market pendulum to shift further in the direction of opportunities.
With alternative systems, too, it is once again necessary to put together the right mix of these heterogeneous systems.
Unlike the euro or the dollar, risk-free investments in Swiss francs still provide a positive return.
Should the states be offered a menu with only one dish or a meal à la carte?
Personally, I believe that the invention of eating à la carte in comparison to the menu with only one dish, which corresponded to the eating habits of the barracks, represented a great advance for civilization.
"We just point out how meals that make you fat can be replaced by low-calorie yet tasty dishes."
In addition, some dishes are complete meals, while others are made entirely of vegetables.
The recommended protein / energy ratio (7 g per 100 kcal) for meat-only dishes is higher than that of one half bovine (5 g per 100 kcal), but much lower than that for chicken, poultry and fish (15 g per 100 kcal).
Fruit juices (with or without added sugar), nectar (diluted fruit juice, usually with added sugar) and dishes made exclusively from fruit have long been the diet of the baby to be breast-fed throughout Europe.
The committee's recommendations allow for a slight increase in the natural carbohydrate content (up to a total of 15 g per 100 ml in fruits and nectars and up to 20 g per 100 g in a fruit-only dish) designed to balance the taste.
Changes in eating habits have also been made by the explosive development of travel, mobility, the emergence of restaurants, etc., offering foreign food, and the increasing popularity of foreign food.
Paella The dish comes from the Spanish rice-growing region on the Mediterranean coast, the Region of Valencia.
A few days later, when he was served the same dish again, he used his detector for the detection of ionizing radiation at that time something very new and enormously impressive and found that the food was radioactive.
He put a little bit of radioactive material in the scraps of food on his plate, and when he was served the same dish again, he used his radiation detector and found out that the food was radioactive.
We also have gluten-free alternatives and dishes for allergy sufferers. "
As a result, there is a great need for convenience foods, which has led to the development of new food products and packaging, such as TV dinners and pre-cooked meals, which are ready to eat or microwave only.
Examples of products that are already being used in the manufacture of these materials include storage-stable dishes, snacks such as potato chips and peanuts, as well as the ultralight "brick-shaped" vacuum packaging for coffee.
Within a generation our food has become more varied and diverse - we eat foods and dishes from all over Europe and around the world.
In each school, the most successful dishes were awarded, and these recipes were published in the magazine "Ha Kuriren".
She learned how to prepare Italian dishes and especially desserts with fresh local ingredients.
However, if you like to travel this way, you have to find these beautiful places first, be sure to get a good reception there and taste authentic local dishes.
Guests enjoyed traditional Finnish dishes based on reindeer, salmon and caviar, as well as Finnish beers.
Organized under the auspices of the President and Secretary General of the EESC and organized in collaboration with Hervé Coupeau (Group III - Various Interests), representatives of young French farmers and the French Overseas Departments, the event featured typical products and culinary specialties from Martinique, Guadeloupe, Réunion, Guyana and Corsica and traditional dishes and drinks.
Adding a little flexibility and freedom so that a group can share dishes with each other, you may even reach an even higher level of satisfaction.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in their volunteer year in several places.
Where everywhere?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture market, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I already worked at the school in open full time.
What are your experiences with it?
Crowd: It's a beautiful, broad spectrum that I see here.
I deal with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years, so a late-called volunteer.
How come?
Crowd: I graduated from high school.
And then a Civil Engineering study, say, successfully canceled.
I realized that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something different, working with people.
And then I asked myself, what are you doing.
Do a social year, there is a glimpse, because you can see how it is locally, in the spotlight maybe, really.
And was that how it was?
Quantity: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in social work in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably make a social worker education in the youth welfare office Herne and study in Hamm at the college.
Is not it unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It always depends on where you do your FSJ.
You can do it from nursing home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
For me it was very varied.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me that was just the thing that irritated me.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works.
Unlike in civil engineering?
Crowd: Of course, this is not about calculating statics.
There are always other people in front of your head, each having a very different story behind him.
Whether a refugee, a teenager who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no fear of contact?
Crowd: I'm not the type for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of friendliness.
There are also negative moments, but that's just life.

The subject of this analysis is the relocation of what is termed the "seat" of a society without dissolution.
The addition "without dissolution" makes it clear that these are the rules of private international law, which determine which law is relevant for a society and whether a society is to be regarded as a legally founded legal person.
The present inquiry confines itself to the question of whether the rules of the Member States in the area of company law and private international law should be aligned in such a way as to create the possibility for companies to transfer their real headquarters to another Member State without dissolution.
(3) the possibility of transferring the registered office of a company without liquidation from the country of establishment, (4) the possibility of transferring the registered office to another Member State while maintaining the legal personality of the company.

Correspondents say that Kabul's suicide bombings in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule by lawsuit
The US Environmental Protection Agency has overturned a decision to delay regulation by the Obama administration, which requires states to curb smog emissions, just one day after fifteen states sued the agency for taking the step.
The EPA announced late Wednesday the decision to push ahead with the so-called "2015 ozone regulations" and said it demonstrates the agency's commitment to work with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and respond to our state partners," said EPA chief Scott Pruitt in a statement.

Municipal council wants community room
In the end, the decision was clear: With two votes against, the Municipal Council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to set up a common room in the future retirement home.
Before the discussion, there is an important information: The purchase contract for the missing part of the property is signed, reports mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will take some time until the area belonging to the congregation to date is in the community ownership, there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be supported by a private investor.
There is a discussion about a common room.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, he would provide a living space - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council is not planning to provide such a common room just as a meeting place for the residents of the elderly-friendly living, but openly into the community.
As an example, the word "knitted cafe" made the rounds.
The decision, which was already decided last autumn by the provision of funds for the current budget, is sweetened by funding opportunities.
The building is located in the redevelopment area.
The establishment of a common room would be, according to Tjaden, with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible.
The proposed resolution, in order to signal to the investor that he does not want to throw any clubs between his legs in this regard, provides that both saddles - which is similar to the surrounding buildings - and pitched roofs - which reduces the eaves height and makes the construction more economical - would be possible.
Needless, so not only Wilfried Sohmer, is this addition.

She sees behind a covert subsidy to anyway wealthy or even foreign investors.
That is not so, because with the acquisition of the area you give no subsidy, but get a real, in case of doubt marketable equivalent, is the counter-speech.
Staiger's request to split the proposed resolution accordingly has three supporters.
So it remains with two votes against the original program, which summarizes Stefan Haller: "If we take the decision so, we take a giant step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure."

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing a possible showdown

I wish you good luck. "

As the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect size".
"I am a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I went up for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I am small for 140.
I want to come down to lightweight.
And he has to move to lightweights [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans demand.
Let us give this to them. "
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that will require Lomachenko to make a 135-pound debut this year to date Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) next summer, which also has an interest in battling Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell's winner after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans asked for it," Garcia said, later openly stating to fight the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever you are ready ... "
Garcia said he likened Lomachenko as "a tremendous fighter" and he might participate in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks the Riverside three-way champion look "very slow, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the knockout".
Garcia said the focus was to show punch, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum building for their own struggle.
"This is the fight that needs to be done.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it, "Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I was waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight. "

Fortunas Hoffmann: "Triplet works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2: 2 at the season opener against Braunschweig, that the optimization of the defensive formation in Aue points brings.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first game of the season, with the result that if they had not conceded two goals against Braunschweig 2: 2.
"There were two goals conceded too much, and we have to take better care in Aue," said the defender of Fortuna Dusseldorf.
In the Erzgebirge the triplet chain is to be further optimized.
And a goal for a free kick, the Fortunen do not want to capture.
"For the future it will be so that no one is next to Michael (Rensing) on the line."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team can cope even better after the experience in the preparation with the triple chain, as with the back four.
"I do not know yet how we will act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we have in the triple chain on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build well," said Hoffmann.
"The prerequisite is, but that we harmonize even better and we do not afford so many playback errors."
Of course, Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game.
"But if you can talk about a failed start after a draw, you do not know.
The performance could be okay, "said Hoffmann.
"But if we stand with four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the trophy, we will certainly be able to speak of a solid season opener."
His coach did not want to know about that.
"I judge the start of the season only after six to eight matchdays," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue, just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be prematurely canceled because of a storm.
"Now they can almost start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann believes that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher, as they would not have a tough and complete game like Fortuna against a promotion favorites in the bone.
"But they do not know 100% where they are right now," said the Fortuna center-back.
Although the guests from the Rhineland as a lightweight favorite on Sunday in the encounter in the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"That we sweep them away, just because we have the claim to get under the first six, is nonsense," says Funkel, whose record is quite positive in just one defeat against Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start," explains Fortuna coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant".
And so Funkel does not want to experience his players on Sunday under any circumstances.

New results of the Swedish asylum assessment tests published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of those tested are older than 18. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) has started testing last year.
During the asylum procedure, they are to make the assessment of age more accurate after the Swedish Migration Service has been criticized for failing to assess the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person may be "under the age of 18".
The tests are only performed in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months.
"We do not see a big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are pretty consistent," he told The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to be over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases that "suggest that the person under investigation is 18 years or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases, the person had openly stated that she would turn 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through adolescence sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I do not think the kind of measurement should be used.
To judge the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can not say for sure, we should not pretend we could, "he told the Metro newspaper.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is when the person is just under 18, in this case about 10 percent. "

Fully on schedule
The work on the three bridges of highway 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is making good progress.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete section was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good in the time, it is going great," says Reinhold Leicht, site manager at the Department of Roads and Transport in the regional council of Freiburg.
In April, the work began simultaneously on all three bridges requiring renovation between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The end of construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to be sure that the schedule will be met.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a concrete vaulted arched bridge clad in red variegated sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, she's now getting old.
To ensure stability and road safety, the three structures are now being thoroughly renovated.
The two other bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red red sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received on Wednesday morning on the north side of a 1.30 meter wide and seven-tonne so-called bridge cap.
This is an edge attachment, which is also used as Betriebsweg.
On the southern part of the bridge on Friday a 2.20 meter wide bridge cap will be used.
Then the pedestrian path should run.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
A special instinct has required the laying of cables through the building in Lauterbach.
Because there runs a fiber-optic cable to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed in advance of the work by leaflets about the project.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the Sammelweiher in the direction of Schramberg, the traffic is regulated by a single traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at Lauterbacher Ortseingang the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is completely closed.
The cost of the three bridge renovations together amount to 700 000 euros.
The whole thing is financed by the land.

AfD in Gerolstein: colorful protest at German potato salad
It does not happen so often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), comes together, which is otherwise difficult to reconcile.
The parties represented in the District Council Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left) belong to a broad alliance, which shows peacefully flag on this day, because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites to loud poster "big election campaign".
And bringing familiar names to the starting line - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland is the top duo for the general election on 24 September, and the Deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are already on the ground hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD learners but to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful".
Originally, the city picnic was planned on Brunnenplatz under the motto "Everyone at a table", but now takes place in the car park below the rondel - and thus right in front of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.
A colorful picture that offers itself.
And what Christa Karoli, chairwoman of the forum A world and one of the leading organizers, really pleased: "Great, how many people have come together here".
There is music and a lot of food, including a "pure German potato salad, which the AfD could easily eat," says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officers to Gerolstein, they show presence especially at the station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes from the AfD Volcanic Eifel reports that he tried to win such an event and was awarded the contract.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first in demand in Daun, but there received a rejection because not enough parking spaces were available because of the already built Laurentius fair.
So now the rondel, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a nice event here".
With regard to the event in the forecourt square, he says: "This is the good right of the people, the main thing, it remains peaceful".
And that's what it does: at around 8 pm, a band on the Rondellvorplatz provides entertainment, and in the town hall various speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall are about 200 listeners, who are waiting for the top candidate for the federal election, Alice Weidel, and the Deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix von Storch make their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.
The AfD event lasts just over an hour, the guests in the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there is tidy up shortly after 9 pm.
The police can move away - no special incidents.

Trombone meets trumpet
A reunion with the Wolfacher trombonist Frederic Belli is in the series Haslacher Klosterkonzerte tomorrow, Sunday, at 20 clock in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or even "Balkan Folklore" meets a classical German education with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov is solo trumpeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is the solo soprano of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the borders of their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of different genres.
For example, Daniel Schnyder's "Weltmusik" unites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by the Jazzechopreist Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and free play merge into a fascinating work of art.
This core piece of the program premiered in Freiburg this spring with huge success.

Coe praises "honest" Russian apology for doping scandal
World Head Athlete Sebastian Coe praised Thursday what he described as an obvious apology from Russia to a doping scandal, but he reiterated that it was not the moment for the country to get back into the sport.
Russia's athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country's banishment from the sport was correct and that he was determined to combat doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were snatched gold and silver medals at competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favor of maintaining the ban that was imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The entire Council and Congress have been pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has had some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the Task Force's recommendations that this is not the time to put Russia back," Coe said.
"We must do everything in the next few months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupted system, "he added

Funeral service for soldiers who crashed in Mali
At a funeral in the northern Hessian Fritzlar have thought about 1,000 people of the two killed in a helicopter crash in Mali soldiers.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precautions.
Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the still unresolved cause of the crash.
She described the two killed pilots as "experts in their field".
"We bow to this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old major and the 47-year-old chief of staff from North Hesse were killed on Wednesday a week ago in West African Mali.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and brought on Thursday accompanied by a wake of the Bundeswehr in the Fritzlar Cathedral St. Peter.
At noon, at first only the relatives in the church took leave.
Thereafter, the funeral began in the circle of family, closest friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics.
Among them were Hesse's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Inspector General of the Armed Forces Volker Wieker.
Mourners laid roses down, their relatives stood arm in arm by the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers watched the ceremony on a screen.
Defense Minister von der Leyen described the perished soldiers as "highly decorated" and experienced.
The staff captain had built the flight operations of helicopter gun Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots his regiment.
Also Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment, to which the soldiers belong, explained: "if this crew could not avert the crash, then no one would have been able".
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali showed Minister von der Leyen not: The operation is dangerous.
But he is also very important "for a country from which we are separated only by two states," she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr made no information.
According to Credit Suisse's fair value model, the Swiss franc continues to be undervalued against the euro, even though it has risen from a franc-euro rate of more than 1.60 to around 1.50 since 2007.
The equity markets of developed countries are valued at a price-earnings ratio (P / E) of 17 versus a P / E of ten for emerging equity markets.
Value investors focus on price-to-price "price", while growth investors are more interested in the "profit" element of that measure.
Thus, contrarian investors choose companies that are undervalued and have negative price momentum.
And finally, the euro-franc exchange rate is still an issue:
For example, the stronger and more often the price of a stock oscillates, the greater the range of fluctuation and the riskier the investment.
"The decision by the Swiss National Bank to set the price at 1.20 was crucial for the growth to revive quickly," recalls Melli.
If you look at the price of gold over a long time series, then you have to say that the yellow metal is not cheap at its current price.
Corporate earnings and earnings momentum are recovering from a low level, and valuations such as price-earnings ratios are beginning to increase in anticipation of rising earnings.
In 2010, Geithner caught the attention of the media and Chinese authorities when he complained to the WEF about the Yuan's course.
If a quick appreciation of the Chinese currency is potentially dangerous for the global economy, why is the White House so fixated on the yuan's rate?
"Even though the price-earnings ratio is currently near the 2007 levels, we do not expect a significant correction right now.
Macroeconomic and corporate earnings will not be among the main drivers, which is why we expect the price-earnings ratio to increase in 2013 as well.
Shirakawa forecasts inflation of just 0.6 percent for 2014, which is well below the BoJ's 2 percent target and could cause the central bank to further weaken the yen rate to reach its inflation target.
The highest returns appear to be achieved when dividend yields are high and the price-earnings ratio (P / E) is low.
higher return on equity, higher price-to-book ratio and higher pay-out ratio, "said Stefano Natella, Head of Global Equity Research in the Investment Banking division of Credit Suisse.
This results in higher price-to-book ratios.
The PEG (P / E divided by earnings growth) ratios of most large and mid-sized companies are still relatively cheap compared to other emerging markets.
As a result of the strengthening of the Swiss franc, the dollar's price dropped from around 4.30 francs to just over 2 francs within just a few years.
Additionally, valuations of future price-earnings ratios appear attractive as most companies are trading at the lower end of their historical range.
After all, the costs for local companies are rising less than those for their competitors abroad, while the exchange rate with the euro remains constant at around 1.20 francs.
The basic idea behind convertible bonds is that they convert into stocks when the price of the company falls below a certain level.
When the franc-euro exchange rate was 1.60, it set much higher margins than it does now when the price is at 1.22.
"Deutsche Bank will have to remove all assets from its portfolio that use money to bet on food prices," said Bode.
Just eleven percent believe that it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices are billed.

Prince Henrik does not want a grave next to his wife
The husband of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
That informed the royal house on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The queen agreed with the decision of her husband, it said in the message.
Where Prince Henrik is buried, is still unclear.
He had no intention of being buried in his native France.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title.
After the accession of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016 he retired and also leaves the title "Prince Consort".
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he did not consider himself equal to his wife - not even after death, said Lene Balleby, the chief speaker of the Danish royal family.
Where the final resting place of the 83-year-old will eventually be, is still unclear.
He had no intention of being buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he worked for over the past 50 years.
Born in Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, Margrethe had met 1965 in London.
He worked at the French Embassy on the Thames.
During his later wife, the sympathy declarations of the people were always flown, had Prince Henrik in his almost 50-year reign with the Danes a difficult position.
In an autobiography, Henrik commented on the first few years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival everything that I did was criticized.
My Danish was unsteady, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knit socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, who smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of socially critical intellectuals in this country, I could not hope for leniency.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed.
That was two mistakes! "

Prime Minister Weil wants a quick new election
CDU and FDP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's prime minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is after the loss of the red-green government majority for a swift election of the state parliament, but he does not want to resign.
Because spoke on Friday for the dissolution of parliament.
Previously, the surprising resignation of a Green MEP from her parliamentary group in Lower Saxony, the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) had plunged into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the state election, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the CDU and FDP opposition.
The former Green Party member Elke Twesten justified her step with the non-nomination for the election in 2018 in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she said on Friday in Hannover.
CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his faction to accept them.
This would have CDU and FDP together 69 seats in the Lower Saxony state parliament, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far the relationship was reversed.
The new state parliament will be elected regularly on the 14th of January next year.
Thümler said that the red-green state government must now decide whether they could continue to govern in this situation without a majority.
Stephan Weil, however, considers it indispensable that the state legislature resolves its own dissolution as soon as possible.
The CDU parliamentary group is expected to decide on how to proceed on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility that the state legislature deprives the prime minister of confidence and chooses a successor.
"Our constitution offers several options.
These options must be checked legally clean, "said Thümler.
"One will calmly discuss all questions, if they are legally reasonably examined."
Thümler called Twesten a step "a bit weird".
The politician herself emphasized: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good ".
She called herself a follower of black and green.
The Greens called on the renegade MPs to return their state mandate.
"Of course, we assume that she will return her state parliament mandate, which she has received via the green state list, with immediate effect," said the country's chairmen Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
Green Party leader Anja Piel said: "We greatly regret Elke Twesten's decision".
She had deliberately decided not to speak in the group.
"Even against the background that there were no substantive differences, we can not understand this step."
SPD chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behavior of the former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the voters, but also a betrayal of red-green," wrote the Bundeschef Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook.
He supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to have the state legislature re-elected quickly.
The exit Twesten costs red-green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician put "in their injured vanity and frustration their personal interests for the good of the country," criticized SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Niedersachsen joins in this dirty intrigues game and tries to use it as a source of political capital."
Lower Saxony's CDU parliamentary leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his deputies to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The faction leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten, with personal career thinking to distort the outcome of the 2013 state election.
The CDU was then the strongest force before the SPD, SPD and Greens had in the parliament but a gossip-thin majority of one vote.

Minister of Agriculture Interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany discusses contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND) question and answer.
Mr Schmidt, how can the consumer protect himself from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information about the concerned egg batches.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we currently know, a health hazard is practically impossible.
Now Aldi takes the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the Enlightenment by the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has been activated immediately and is since the announcement of the concern of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
The trade, like the manufacturers, has to ensure that the products sold are marketable and harmless to health.
If eggs exceed the maximum residue level of 0.005 mg / kg, they are not marketable.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time, it's not the companies that are to blame.
Do production plants and consumers sit in the same boat?
According to the current state of knowledge, the production companies are not directly responsible.
On the contrary, they have to expect economic damages due to allegedly illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there are too few controllers in an emergency.
Is there only a lack of personnel or coherent competence?
It was just the official controls that uncovered the case.
However, the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100 percent.
Precisely because of this, a consistent investigation of such events and the handing over to the public prosecutor's offices in cases in which criminal offenses may be present are of decisive importance.
I have already made it clear several times that I expect the responsible authorities to provide complete information.
Is the regular alarmism in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and tradable food.
When an unauthorized insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The tainted means put manufacturers, dealers and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the unlawful use of the insecticide fipronil in the husbandry of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be ended immediately.
This must be done consistently and at full speed at all levels.
I expect all responsible authorities to clarify the facts quickly and completely.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules, which aim to prevent unchecked spending by European football clubs, will not disturb Neymar's world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will come for UEFA's Paris Saint-Germain, as the governing body overseeing the European match has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 indicate that PSG will eventually have to prove that the transfer was financed by Neymar without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($ 262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will be tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG is sure to be able to cash in for Neymar to sign and bring him into a galaxy of other stars given the team's funding from the power-hungry ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs may spend a lot of money buying players, but they need to counteract with legitimate sources of revenue that will allow them to break even in their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken on enormous debt in their pursuit of success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on club debt to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher business.
During the current three-year FFP assessment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of € 30 million.
And although Platini fell from favor with the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to discourage excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, to The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the transfer fee for the next five years of € 44.4 million can be recognized in the financial statements.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 was hit hardest by PSG, along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014/15 season remains limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that might try to outsmart their financial supervision by inflating their revenues through companies that are affiliated with the owners of a club.
While a Qatar company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship exceeded the standard market rates, UEFA would not consider this a legitimate income.
This is precisely what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come from payments made by the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassador and that such a maneuver for the UEFA regulators could be easy to find out.
The recent sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA has not had any preparatory talks with PSG on Neymar's transfer, Thursday said the people familiar with the situation.
They spoke on condition of anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG achieved a profit of more than € 10 million with sales of € 542.4 million in 2015/16.
The accounts for the last fiscal year still need to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club expects that sales will increase after signing by at least 30 percent.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go and tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said La Liga President Javier Tebas, Spanish daily AS, regarding Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances a club.
"It's the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the past 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.
"Once a country has an association, anything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country. "
The Turkish community of Germany responded with caution: at the weekend it reminded the victims of racist violence with a vigil outside the Brandenburg Gate.
The Urban Call for Proposals on the 16 Gates re-opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
No doubt a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either that's how it is or someone intends to put gates in the country.
Collserola is more complex, "says the architect, for whom the title" Gates of Collserola "contains a" lexical trap ": one should not imagine them" as entrances to a park, but as a delimitation of areas where action must be taken. "
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a goal would collide with that of the architect of the gate next to it.
State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success", "marginalized" people "always standing in front of closed doors" "hope" and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opened its doors, infected by the spirit of solidarity".

Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
Over the past few years, Chocolat Frey has produced Bord-chocolate for Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is facing a possible end: The airline rewrites the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a report from the newspaper "Northwestern Switzerland" from Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be inspected and quality controlled every two to three years.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the spokeswoman.
About 17 million small red and white boxed Schoggitafeln to 14 grams per year distribute the flight attendants before landing to the passengers.
Swiss did not want to give any details about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwestern Switzerland" at 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros subsidiary generates an annual turnover of around one billion francs.
But more important is the advertising effect: For a chocolate maker it is a prestigious order.
Like many applicants in the new tender, Swiss does not want to reveal.
In question, but only Swiss manufacturers.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to seek a renewal of the contract beyond spring 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for comment.
Since 2006, Swiss has been distributing chocolate tablets on board their flights.
Before Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
The opportunity to place the logo was introduced by Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, first-class customers are spoiled with delicacies from the Confiserie Sprüngli, while in Business Class passengers are nibbled by Lindt's chocolate and Chocolat Frey's Economy Class Schoggi.
Swiss chocolate is also distributed by Chocolat Frey on short-haul routes, both in Business and Economy Class.
However, energy policy can not be judged solely on the basis of environmental considerations, since soon no single power plant of any kind would be erected, and all stone, clay and earth-processing and all chemical industries would have to be tested on the acceptance conditions of their waste among the population and - to quote Mrs Weber once again - would have to wait for a long time, if not in vain, for acceptance.
In addition to clay and glass, metals, cardboard and plastics are now used as raw materials for their production.
This should be done in the best tone.
And the best sound is under the House of Commons.
I have not yet heard a Conservative say that we should store the waste in the best clay under the Thames.

According to PRINZ / 15 / cohesive soil types always consist of a mixture of clay and silt fractions with very different proportions of coarser grain fractions.
Under the same climatic conditions, the content of organic substances in the clay is higher than in silt or loam.
In particular clay, but also loam, are incorporated as natural materials in layers with predominantly static compaction at the landfill base.
The sealing of landfills with such clay-sand mixtures is extremely economical and easy to control run.
The secondary earth (clay) sealing layer of variant 2 consists exclusively of earth.
It is recommended that this base layer be made from post-compacted earth (usually clay) rather than pending, in situ compacted soils.
To calculate the thickness of the earth (clay) layer, some procedures are offered by the EPO.
In the newly drafted draft directive, it is pointed out that for this system variant the previous legal requirements (60 cm compressed clay with a k_ value of 1 χ 109 m / s) are no longer sufficient.
In the case of the thin-wall method, the compaction of the substrate is achieved in accordance with the respective geological conditions either by filling or compressing sealing compounds (clay-cement and bentonite-cement mixtures).
The gradient i of the wall region is calculated from the water level difference and the thickness of the sealing wall, while the gradient i for the sealing horizon (clay, silt) is determined from the water level difference and the embedment depth of the trough wall.
The clay acts as a semi-permeable membrane.
However, the anion exchange capacity is increased by the organic substance kerogen, which can be finely divided in clay up to 2% by weight.

These early characters on clay or stone were the first forerunners of sophisticated language tools whose development is still ongoing today.
The clay is first provided with a glaze layer and then sintered in the fire at temperatures up to 1160 ° C so that it reaches the desired mechanical strength and hardness.
Since 1965, the German company Eisenhütte Westfalia-Lünen has been building small propulsion machines of the type mole, fox and badger, which are mainly used in soft rock (clay, gypsum, pyrite).
100 g of soil (fertile, non-sterile soil) are suspended in 1 000 ml of chlorine-free drinking water (soil types with a very high content of clay, sand and organic carbon are unsuitable).
The results of the studies carried out under the PAGIS project have been published in a five-volume edition: a short version (EUR 11775EN), clay (EUR 11776EN), granite (EUR 11777FR), salt (EUR 11778EN) and undersea sediments (EUR 11779EN).
The clay, this malleable material used by our ancestors for a variety of purposes and used today in fields as diverse as construction or the pharmaceutical industry, has attracted the attention of scientists and technicians through its physical and chemical properties to develop a safe and reliable system for the disposal of nuclear waste by burial in deep rock layers.
The main chemical component of the clay is an aluminosilicate, which is a refractory material, so that the clay is not a good conductor of heat.

The target formation, the so-called boom clay, can be found in the subsoil of the site and has a width of more than 100 m, enough so that a deposit could be established at a depth of over 200 m below the surface.
The boom clay has some very attractive properties, such as lithological homogeneity, very low permeability and excellent retention.
Under the boom tone you can see a series of changing layers of sand and clay.
At the Mol site and in its immediate vicinity, the sand layer under the boom clay is not used for groundwater pumping because of its high solute content and low yield.

Suitable materials include inactive substances such as clay, possibly mixed with polymers, pulverized fly ash or asphalt concrete, but also geotextile films, such as synthetic material of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or high density polyethylene (HDPE) are increasingly used.
When closing the landfill, an approx. 1 m high end cover made of clay and field crop is applied.
The last 50 cm of the shaft is sealed with an impermeable concrete, bentonite or clay material to prevent, on the one hand, the influx of air and, on the other hand, the escape of the collected landfill gas into the atmosphere.
Components of the secondary rock: calcareous clay, gray and black clay, limestone, compact gray marl.
Since the addition of sulfuric acid and the mixing with clay did not lead to conclusive results, the possibility of mixing quicklime and optionally a pozzolanic reagent was tested.

Nostalgia enters the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of the story is also nostalgic for the glory days of the characters of the '80s, for the' 90s grunge era (when masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter shot the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, and Paul Rudd went on to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is both a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just for its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By stiffening themselves to the core of the joke - middle-aged actors playing horny children who grow up - they still managed to lose the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later," with its grown-up adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody is more of a watering-can, including a riff on 90s stalker films like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."
At one point, a character rummages through an Apple Powerbook, some in-line skates, and "a number of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The amiable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy-evil plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-received impression from Michael Ian Black).
As always, the digressions are the best part of the franchise.
It's a lot of fun to see the ever-young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's "Singles" underbelly, whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like an old man.
It's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" Series until it achieves what I take for granted: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the band attending the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans", the movie "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East vs. West wrestling iconography.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, the comedy starring Rhys Thomas as a director claims to be a found TV series: a 1980s Romanian drama with the two policemen as friends, two Bucharest officers fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The lead roles - a hard-fought Gregory and an idealistic Joseph - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it is not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spends time watching chess on television, as Americans may do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent match find the voice game.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the veracity of a desperate propaganda drama-a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is included-that it often plays as one.
With six long episodes, it drags on, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective," which was edited to a lesser length, could better deliver his agitprop satire, as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men who devour a pile of hamburgers.

Beat against drug mafia in the country
The police have succeeded in striking the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar district, in Rottweil, Constance, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutor's office Constance announced on Friday.
Fifteen accused were arrested between the age of 25 years and 77 years and have already issued arrest warrants.
In addition, officials secured large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and hundreds of thousands of euros.
During simultaneous raids in Italy, two people were arrested.
Against the two suspects Italians there were German arrest warrants.
The two are therefore probably shipped to Germany.
The action involved Italian and Bavarian investigators.
In total, over 300 police officers were on duty.
Members of the Mafia are accused of organized drug-related crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder, robbery and extortion.
Since the summer of 2016, the public prosecutor's office in Konstanz has been investigating organized drug trafficking in southern Germany.
Between the public prosecutor's offices in Constance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the large-scale operation was accompanied on Wednesday morning by four officials from Palermo.
In particular, Italian nationals with close ties to the Italian mafia came under the spotlight.
Also an incident on 27 May in Hüfingen, in the early morning several shots were fired into a restaurant, should go to the gang's account.
Weise laments large gaps in the foreigners register
"Data of citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the register of foreigners in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to sometimes serious wrong decisions in asylum procedures.
The Federal Government Commissioner for Refugee Management, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has, according to a media report, called attention to large gaps in the Central Register of Foreigners.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to "sometimes serious wrong decisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, warned way in an analysis that is the "Süddeutsche Zeitung".
The register reports that there are 10 million people of foreign nationality, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data are thus administered by about 600 immigration authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts had not been good so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 had been found, "of people who are no longer alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and in the register should actually no longer appear."
"Incorrect data entry can significantly slow down return processes," the report said.
The statistics on people obliged to leave the country also include EU citizens who do not need to leave.
However, such misallocations led to "a distorted debate on how to deal with people leaving the country," according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the federal government has apparently begun to send refugee families with children under the age of 16 back to Italy once they have entered from there.
This emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
The paper states that the BAMF is carrying out such procedures "concerning families with children - except infants and young children - back to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this was virtually impossible, the newspaper said, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
According to the Dublin agreement, refugees are the responsibility of the EU state, which they reach first.
If a migrant goes on to another EU country, that state can send him back to the country of entry.
As justification, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the absorption capacity for families with underage children in Italy has increased significantly".
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) considers these pledges to be sufficient.
Other EU countries would send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
The domestic spokeswoman for the left-wing group in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: "Families with children are threatened by human rights violating reception conditions and a danger to the child's well-being because of the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system".
Second best result achieved

At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
Above all, Jürgen Greule, who meanwhile shared 50 liters of blood with his 100 donations.

The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the slowdown in inflation dampened speculation about rising.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it maintains interest rates on family income in the midst of mounting pressures.
The Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) policymakers voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members looking for a hike this month as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation likely to rise to just under 3% in the autumn.
But she signaled that over the next few years interest rate hikes would be needed to curb Brexit-fueled inflation, and she said credit costs may have to rise more than expected on the financial markets.
The members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth stimulus package that was issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide £ 15 billion more under this system - £ 115 billion.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as pressure on household real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."
On interest rates, she reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would require a slowdown in inflation and a "somewhat greater" extent than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank emphasized that increases would be "gradual" and "limited".
The Bank's downwardly revised growth forecasts for this and next year are 1.9% and 1.7%, respectively, compared to May forecast.
It has maintained its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to $ 1.31, down 0.4% to $ 1.11.
The decision to make no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures dampened rising interest rate hike expectations and second-quarter GDP rose from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.
Growth is expected to be at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly towards the end of the year, according to the bank.
The recent inflation report has been less buoyant for households affected by rising inflation and small salary increases, as the tightening gets worse at first, before it improves.
She added that monetary policy could not "prevent" the slump in income over the next few years, but she added that wages will "recover significantly" at the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also being bolstered by rising demand for British goods due to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes one year after the cut in interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy.
Prior to the Bank's latest interest rate ruling, the call for a rate hike had risen as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for a rise to 0.5% in July.
Inflation has fallen from 2.9% in June to 2.6% last month, although the bank said it was expected and would pick up again in the coming months.
The bank said the overshoot relative to its 2% target was "wholly" due to the weaker pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as lenders clamor for deals and end the year in positive territory.

NHS (The National Health Service) will prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment in September following a fight in the High Court against funding the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-sexual pre-exposure prevention (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by approximately 86 percent, is now being delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to finance the process after the Court of Appeal upheld a Supreme Court ruling last year stating that the NHS had the authority to pay for PrEP despite allegations that local authorities should finance it.
Thursday's gambit was greeted by NHS England boss Simon Stevens as an "important new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a "crucial moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to enroll, and additional clinics will follow in October before it will be launched throughout England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a result of pre-sex HIV medications used to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that there are just enough medicines in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals, and those with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics, appropriate participants are identified who consent to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will be £ 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence as it is targeted, ingested and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said, "This major new intervention was designed to complement and overtake far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than three decades of progress in addressing one of humankind's greatest health challenges. "
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
By September, people at high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded effort in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, resulting in the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority now must be that the study be carried out quickly across the country and that no one at risk for HIV be left behind.
Now that PrEP's test medicine has been procured, we are well on our way to protecting more than 10,000 HIV-infected people. "
Shadow Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant government implementation.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop the transmission of this life-altering infection.
This trial brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study be conducted as quickly as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV-infected and that it will help bring us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society. "
Living the big life: Mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, shrunk from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It's on the first floor of a sleek Queen Anne Terrace - and it's testament to the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"Before that, I lived in a much larger space with my ex in Knightsbridge," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day. "
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement, "she says.
To this end, she commissioned Duck & Shed's architecture and design studio, Erick Azadi of Notting Hill, to use the 12.5 foot ceilings to create a home that was not just a development, but a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms one above the other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine floor where one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the requirement.
"The steel plant is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without us having to bend over.
It was not just about building a simple platform, but putting the steel in the right height for the top or bottom function. "
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height on top of each other - with much added drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.
At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all of Joanne's cutlery and glasses.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when not in use.
Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.
The special feature of this is that it is a garage door.
"A little bit of engineering went in there," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so it slides very easily when you push the door up."
The clever use of space and storage allowed Joanne to gain an additional 16 m², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you will sell the floor space - or how your property will be valued," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a realtor will enter and make a calculation based on floor size."
Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using high quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things that touch you and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You do not fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "
It shows that a dwelling can change from something standard to something completely astonishing, thanks to its good design and increased square footage.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave them.
An architectural history with ups and downs and a happy ending: The Austrian World Expo Pavilion of Brussels in 1958 won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and disintegrated.

Ariel Osorio, a journalist for the Como en casa program on the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss shows "that the candidate who wins the most prizes in the competition does not become queen after all".

Brothers are fighting over a $ 500 million real estate empire
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute over one of the largest real estate empires of Victoria worth over 500 million dollars.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a Toorak mansion, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be divided.
Paul had wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
The brothers, along with their mother Anna, have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars since the family bought a store in Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the Westco family founded Jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $ 85 million.
This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis' portfolio now includes city center offices, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the Gold Coast apartments and Mt Buller, and shopping malls in the suburbs.
Following an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as the "principal operator and dominating personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third.
A court file says that this means that Colin owns $ 316 million of property and $ 176 million of Paul's.
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I consider the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit.
Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - which Colin, as Paul claims, has barred him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of managing some possessions incompetently.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs are increasing in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both-sided law firms.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessens in the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They took advantage of the security to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my final years of high school, when Paul was a small child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass their property on to their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $ 10 million and Luke $ 26 million on leaving the company.
Both Luke and Mark are, according to Paul "bitter over the conditions of their financial separation".
Colin has held back a great deal, despite being a former AFL board member and Eddie McGuire's best friend of the television stars, based on a 2015 biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied by SMS to say "I really can not say much" because the case is in the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and sue our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court saying he had tried to fulfill his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current quarrel," he said, adding that he "still hopes for a solution."
On Friday, this hope seemed over.
"Our case will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
We strongly condemn the disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force.

The Council should also be in a position to provide technical assistance to States and provide political advice to States as well as to United Nations bodies.
Members of the United Nations should be able to seek the advice of the Peacebuilding Commission at any stage and request assistance from a Permanent Peacebuilding Fund.
This would make it possible to co-ordinate internal legal expertise and to provide expert advice, both within and outside the United Nations, on the consistency of national legislation and practices with international human rights obligations, and the demand for such expert advice would likely increase as the Office interacts with countries more closely.
The OHCHR can benefit from the support, analysis and expertise of civil society, providing support, providing training and advice on contact with United Nations bodies.
At an international level, some civil society organizations may help to establish or mobilize global partnerships on specific issues or raise awareness of the needs of indigenous peoples and other fringe groups, while others share best practices with other countries by exchanging experiences between communities and providing technical assistance and advice to governments.
I do not think that such an institution should carry out any early warning or monitoring functions, but it would be useful for Member States to consult the Peacebuilding Commission at any time and request assistance from a permanent Peacebuilding Fund to develop their domestic conflict-prevention institutions, including by strengthening the rule of law institutions.

The card is a reminder that Fed chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues set the nation's economic interests ahead of everything else.
LEGAL BASIS: Article 103 of the EEC Treaty, Basic Regulation 974/71 OBJECTIVES: To avoid short-term distortions of trade which would cause the difference between the market rate and the agricultural conversion rate or the 'green' exchange rate expressed in ECU in some Member States.
- for the Member States whose currency is higher in value than the ECU equivalent calculated on the basis of the agricultural conversion rate (green price), monetary compensatory amounts are imposed on imports and granted on exports (positive MCAs);
For this purpose, MCAs are no longer calculated according to the difference between the green price and the central rate but according to the difference between the green rate and the "central rate multiplied by a correction factor".
For every 100,000 persons, each receiving 4,500 DM, 50% of which from the ESF, funds of 225 million DM or 120 M1o ECU (rate 1: 1) would have to be earmarked annually.
On 8 October 1990, sterling entered the exchange rate mechanism with its ECU central rate at 0.696904, slightly different from the previous notional rate.
It is this outflow that has helped lower the value of the yen below the price otherwise expected.
Whether time-limited foreign exchange funds, whether supported course for certain amounts or much else, here economic experts must help, but quickly and without long and time-consuming examinations.
The second value is the current conversion rate or "green rate", which allows the conversion of common agricultural prices into national prices.
Since the price of the new EURO may be unstable, especially in the initial phase, it can also entail large fluctuations in world market prices for agricultural products when these are converted into euros.
Is the principle of equal treatment under company law, inter alia within the meaning of Article 42 of the EC's Second EC Directive, justified if the Danish State can enforce the foreclosure of shares of Teledanmark private shareholders at a rate of 125 and redeem these shares of Teledanmark at Ameritech USA at a price of 4,700?
We know that the euro is losing value, the price is too high.
- The central rates: From the ecu value of a currency, its price can be derived in each of the other participant currencies (cross rate): these are the bilateral central rates.
The Community shall reimburse the amount referred to in paragraph 1 at the rate of the ECU applicable on 1 May 1996 (1 ECU - 6,44527 ffrs).
The financing plans of the Community Support Frameworks and the Community intervention amounts shall be expressed in ecus, at the rate set out in this Decision, the payments being made to the following account:
The financing plans of the Community Support Frameworks and the amounts of the Community aid payments shall be expressed in ecus at the rate specified in this Decision.
(1) The agricultural conversion rate to be applied to the compensatory amounts is the rate applicable on the first day of the month on which the products are actually taken over by
2. In the case of Guayanas, the agricultural conversion rate to be applied to the compensatory amounts shall be that applicable on the first day of the month on which the products are shipped.
If the amounts to be paid in the individual currencies are fixed in relation to another currency, they are converted at the rate specified in the order.
For the other currencies, there was no gap between the green price and the market rate (including the correction factor).
The conversion will be made according to the rate valid 30 days before the deadline for the submission of tenders.
The financing plans of the Community support frameworks are expressed in ecus, using the rate set out in this Decision.
3. The Commission's financial contribution shall be paid in ecus at the rate applicable on the first working day of the month in which the refund application published in the Official Journal of the European Communities was submitted.
In contrast, tax law introduced procedures for deducting exchange rate differences resulting from the translation of monetary foreign currency items when the closing rate differs from the rate at which they were booked or included in previous financial statements (Article 72 of Income Tax Act 917/1986).
Income and expenses are translated at the rate that was valid on the date of the transaction, and in practice, an average price is generally used.
If the transaction is to be settled at a contractually agreed rate, this rate must be used.
This means, in particular, that monetary foreign currency items are translated at the closing rate, unless a "hedging" rate in accordance with paragraph 48 is used.
As a result, the results for the financial year are always shown at the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet date.
In most cases, receivables and / or liabilities denominated in foreign currency were translated at the rate prevailing on the date of entry, with unrealized gains not recognized at the balance sheet date, but the corresponding translation losses well recognized.
This course must be indicated in the appendix. "
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are stated at their original acquisition value, converted into ecus at the rate prevailing at the time of acquisition.
The Commission's land and buildings acquired in Brussels after 1992, as well as representations and delegations, are shown in the balance sheet in the amount of their cost in local currency, converted into ecus at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of acquisition.
The buildings acquired before 1981 in Brussels were recorded after conversion to the ecu rate of January 1981.
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are stated at their original acquisition value, converted into ecus at the rate prevailing at the time of acquisition.
When drawing up the annual budget estimates for the expenditure referred to in Article 4, the ECU / dollar exchange rate shall be the average market parity for the first three months of the preceding year.
Significant currency adjustments took place during these years: the exchange rates of all the currencies of the former group of countries increased, the French franc fell slightly, and all other exchange rates fell sharply.
Between September 1992 and March 1995, the price of the peseta in the EMS was adjusted four times (17.9.92, 22.11.92, 13.5.93 and 6.3.95), and in total it was devalued by 26% within two and a half years.
Since then, the ECU has also been replaced by the euro at the rate of 1: 1.
The stated exchange rate is the rate applicable at the end of the reporting period.

Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to reduce the flow of information to President Trump - including the news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course.
Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met senior executives on his first day at work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House he wanted to fix: bad information getting into the president's hands.
Kelly told employees that information should flow through him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information. "
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his television ad is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was upset over unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage from posts that were convincing," former campaign consultant Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption is a steady praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officials know something we do not know about others - that Trump's tweets would have contained more fuel without their intervention.
We'll probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump did not send.
If his employees have managed to keep him out of trouble a few times, their efforts have paid off.
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House made up of competing parties, people keep trying to advance their own agendas by presenting Trump material that may be promoting their views of the world.
Politico, a full-time story, reported in May on the adviser's predilection to provide dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he stiffened to figure out where they came from.
That's what happened in late February, when someone maliciously gave the President a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banished from Twitter for harassment or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has made false allegations in the past and has withdrawn them.
Trump read the article and began questioning people about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary-General Rob Porter "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."
How did that work?
Kelly tries to do the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still seeking influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
In short, they fear that all the sacrifices made for price stability will have been in vain.

Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he elected, he would argue that the FAČR would be given new statutes that would rule out disputes over the electoral system from the outset.

In the current boom, contagion has taken place within and across markets as rising prices fuel enthusiasm - and thus further price increases - first within one city and then in other cities, even at the other end of the world.
Historically, home prices have developed tremendously and prices in these cities are still rising at a rapid pace, although this increase is slower than one or more years ago.
Based on projections of growth trends, it appears certain that in most of these cities, prices will continue to rise significantly for another year or more, even if the rate of increase continues to decline.
The prices in glamor cities are likely to fall sharply in the next serious recession, or in the event of a shock to the local economy or too rapidly rising interest rates.
In this case, contagion within and across markets could set in motion a downward spiral and lower prices over years.
Travelers negotiate a ditch and return to the millionaire series
Some of the West Midlands' most affluent homeowners are at war again with some determined travelers who have negotiated a ditch drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
The travelers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull called the "Millionaires Series".
They brought horses, babies, and an army of transporters after they were thrown out in May, but not deterred by a ditch excavated by the council to prevent their invasions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhampered to find a way.
Angry residents have harassed the advice of Solihull, who said it was "useless to deal with the problem."
An anonymous resident said, "They moved there on Monday night after being sent away by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame on its implementation, as it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably more today. "
She added, "The Birmingham Council knows how to handle it by giving long briefings to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue to pay my council tax if the council can not even stop it. "
A resident, who did not want to be named, said, "It's ridiculous, we've just seen the last round of these travelers, only to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park area. "
A spokeswoman for the Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the countryside beyond Streetsbrook Road and we are working with the Solihulls police and we are taking the necessary legal action to get them moving as quickly as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps to get a picture of the situation in which the court has to check when we present our case. "

Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise.
The house on the outskirts of Freudenstadt is being renovated and is scheduled to re-open on 1 March next year.
That's good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the former Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also income from the visitor's tax.
In the fall of 2014, in light of the dramatic increase in the number of refugees arriving in the district, the hotel building was offered to the district administration as a collective housing, which led to controversial discussions.
The city prevented the placement of asylum seekers by establishing a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not uncontroversial in the local council.
But especially Freudenstadt Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke at that time of serious interested in the house.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels Group with managing director Birgit Scherer, headquartered in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and intends to turn it into a three star plus category hotel under the name of Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, rubble containers have been standing in front of the entrance for quite some time, and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is being done.
The floors were torn out, ceilings partially dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still much to do until March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in an interview with our newspaper.
Everything should be renewed in Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is being redesigned, new windows are being added.
Everything should later "be close to the citizens", as Thomas Scherer puts it.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it."
There is a swimming pool, spa and meeting room.
One does not want to position oneself on the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an elevated inner-city level, stresses Scherer.
The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set up a large space, Scherer continues.
Both individual tourists, groups or business people should feel at home in the hotel.
He already had talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, Scherer said.
The ideas of the city are congruent with those of the hotel group.
"We are on the same line."
Asked about the amount of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to be specific.
Just under one million euros, he calculates.
The outdoor facilities are brought to framwork, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard, a large terrace will emerge, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
It is not an easy task, but it has to be done now and there is no way around it.
The "much more important task" is due on Sunday.
No single accident is the same and calculating the cost of parts and labor hours can be a tedious and complicated task.
The basic models typically only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
The joke of the matter is that the company appears to the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone does not run in their name, so they can not fully enjoy it as the normal customers of mobile operators. "
"In these places the travelers also a switch with trained personnel is available, which advises prospective customers with the Internet purchase and plays also the coupon on the map", so the spokesman of the project Martin Opatrný.
A passenger who does not drive with suburban buses and does not know when the validity of the coupon ends, can in turn go to the self-service machines, where the coupons are applied to the card.
The new elections are over, and now it's all about the coalition, and in the debates on public television, party leaders barely looked at their cards.
Russia affair: US special investigator uses grand jury
In the Russia affair of US President Donald Trump special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called grand jury, according to a report.
The panel has begun work in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal said, citing people who are familiar with the case.
The newspaper interpreted the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.
The CNN reported that there were already initial summonses of the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for deliberately interfering in the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there were collusion between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation will focus on several men who acted as advisors to the Republican in the election campaign.
Mueller also reportedly scrutinized more and more of Trump's private and business environment.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator Trump personally moved into the center and investigate the charge that the President may have obstructed the judiciary in the wake of the affair.
The main task of Grand Juries is to examine evidence in possible cases of crime and decide whether to file an indictment.
Grand juries are therefore also called prosecution.
In most cases, they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.
The panel may also be called in by the prosecution to summon persons to the hearing under oath.
According to the CNN channel, subpoenas have already been issued centering around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Persons who were involved in the meeting were invited to testify, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr. were also Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former campaign boss Paul Manafort in the conversation.
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the appointment shows that Mueller is not intimidated in his work and that he, if necessary, wanted to act quickly.
But it does not necessarily mean that the grand jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the filing of an indictment.
Nevertheless, the creation of the panel is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign against his political opponents.
"The history of Russia is a total invention," said Trump.
The theme gives Democrats an opportunity to "feel good because they have nothing else to talk about".
His special advisor Ty Cobb stated in a statement that he knew nothing about the appointment of a grand jury.
But this also usually works secretly, he emphasized.
The White House supported any action that accelerated the Special Investigator's work in a "fair" manner.
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that he will not investigate the president.
There is no reason to assume that something has changed, said the statement.
But Mueller was only used after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this expulsion allegations against Trump had become loud, he had wanted to obstruct the judiciary.
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop investigating the then National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.
The president is under pressure because of the investigation.
According to US media, the White House collected material against the Special Investigator and his staff.
This triggered speculation about whether Trump wanted to dismiss Mueller.
Unlike an independent congressional special investigator, such as in the Watergate affair surrounding the late resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the urging of the President of the Department of Justice.
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented bills on Thursday stating that the special investigator could not be dismissed that easily.
Antarctic: Gigantic iceberg drifts in the Antarctic
In the West Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg of almost seven times the size of Berlin has broken free of the ice shelf.
This was announced on Wednesday by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven.
The more than one trillion-ton and 5,800 square kilometers of colossus now drift north and would probably take two or three years to melt.
With a length of 175 kilometers and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.
A danger to humans does not emanate from him.
To what extent climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear, according to researchers.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual ice fracture collapses in the region for some 30 years, the US Snow and Ice Research Center (NSIDC) writes in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now broken colossus was previously part of the Larsen C ice shelf.
Ice shelf floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It therefore continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly.
The Larsen C ice shelf is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this ice shelf, the balance of waxing and breaking was disturbed several years ago.
A complete ice shelf has decayed there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is some evidence that the Larsen C ice shelf is in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far back as currently.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can disintegrate, if a key point break off a piece.
The melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not increase the sea level as they float on the water and ice displaces as much water as it gives off after melting itself.
However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the glaciers flowing directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.
This could possibly increase the sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project on the observation of the Antarctic (Midas).
The Larsen C ice shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in the Antarctic, according to AWI data at almost 50,000 square kilometers.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the open ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks off regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary of Swansea University in the UK.
"This is the furthest retreat since records began," he confirmed.
Scientists are debating whether the Larsen C ice shelf will now grow again or go back in the long term and possibly coincide, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "Our models say that it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many ice shelves in the Antarctic Peninsula have decayed in recent decades.
This long tip of the Antarctic extends towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research program, the Antarctic Peninsula's ice surface has fallen by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s.
The fall has contributed to the increase in temperature.
Over the past 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by around three degrees, making it one of the fastest growing areas.
The adjustment fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member council, presumably at the UN's Global Environment Facility (GEF), as stated in the "Piac és Profit".

CDU wants house rate at the staff
As it becomes more and more difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU demands to leave the employers' organization to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the district council waved through 41 new positions in the administration.
More than 1,100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now another 17 apprentices have their first day of work behind them.
The apprenticeships in the district are obviously very sought after.
Around 620 applications were submitted for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle lacks more staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
Currently there are still 50 unfilled vacancies at the district of Mettmann.
We are looking for doctors and engineers as well as general administrative staff.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative in the district council together with the FDP and the UWG and to counteract the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
The administration is to develop according to the wishes of the parties "a concept for recruitment and personnel development".
The aim is not only to cover short-term needs of skilled workers, but to counteract future-oriented shortages of applicants, it is said.
The overall concept should be oriented inward and outward, show concrete measures for lateral entrants and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with staffing problems that were previously not known.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms.
There is talk of a veritable "competition of public employers".
In addition, there is a high number of employees leaving the service due to illness or age.
High time for action so that not more jobs remain vacant.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, fraction leader of the CDU, goes with his party beyond the joint request.
He recently caused a big surprise in the district council when he publicly questioned the personnel costs and stunned the other parties.
Völker wants all possibilities, which make it possible to leave the local employers' association, to be checked.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration should strive for a house tariff with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the district-owned cities", said Völker.
By doing so, the CDU is trying to pay its employees and civil servants better than the public service tariff does.
The salaries are currently prescribed exactly, increases or more money, there is only if you move to a higher level, which is based on years of work.
But the tasks of the district have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up, in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection Act.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, district administrator Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs, who choose more for the republican side, to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections.
Bulgaria demands full commitment.
"The dedication, discipline and motivation of Earthwatch researchers are a real source of inspiration for us," said Volunteer Birgit Frankenberg, Business & Project Management, Credit Suisse Germany, Frankfurt.

Italy is sharpening the tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs using lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they can not continue this if they do not abide by new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came one day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat owned by the German aid organization 'Jugend Rettet' because their team had effectively collaborated with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has only been in operation for a year, declined to comment on detailed allegations made by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, the salvation of human life is and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we can not operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We can not judge all the allegations that are currently being made until we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of 'Youth Rescue', the Iuventa, since October.
It is believed that its crew takes dinghy migrants on board, which are supplied directly by traffickers, and that the smugglers can leave for the ships to be used again.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of overriding the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which supervises rescue operations in the area for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reason.
Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must first and foremost have an Italian police officer overseeing their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, MOAS of Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms of Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring about "significant changes or disability" in their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Peace Laureate Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti said meanwhile that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the bailout has declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and work with local mayors have borne fruit.
"In the last few days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives, and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hopes of reaching Europe.
a modest home market compared to worldwide sales.
The Central and Eastern European countries have gained in importance for Switzerland since their accession to the EU, both as production sites and as sales and procurement markets.
As the price of oil reached $ 150 a barrel, sales in the US shifted to more fuel-efficient models.
At BMW, the growth rates for sales of the first six months of the year were even 100 percent.
We also make this experience when investing in the sales of road cars.
And he adds that providing information about a company's philanthropic activities is just as important as communicating sales or competitor information to board meetings.
The sales of TrueView ads, ie commercials that either play before the start of a video or appear next to it as a display ad, also rose 45 percent last year.
The trained industrial engineer (Berchten) and the robotics specialist (Guernier) are convinced that their product will find their way into the market, and count on 80,000 to 100,000 sold airbags per year for the future.
Sales of computers, printers, servers and additional storage capacity will lag behind software and services for the time being, but will eventually catch up over time and perhaps even boost yields in the highly competitive PC market.
After declining 10 percent year-over-year in the first quarter of 2013, second-quarter PC shipments were roughly at the same quarter-quarter level, indicating a stabilization in sales.
Climbs and trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berlin Outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate for four days to enjoy trials and sightseeing.
There were three friendly guides available.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
It was followed by lookout points, partly on towers, from which one could look far over the Palatinate Forest and the upstream levels.
In between there were always longer climbs, rewarded for the long trials.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the saline and the folk festival sausage market.
Again the viewpoint lined the lookout point, joined by "flowige" trials and moderate climbs.
On the last two days, many vertical meters were announced again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refuges brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, bikers inhaled healing brine in the outdoor inhalatory.
Also Neustadt was controlled.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 vertical meters, the group got to know the Palatinate Forest at its best - sporty and cultural.
Console instead of grass - Bundesliga is gearing up for e-sports
Do the sports stars in the future sit in front of computer consoles instead of fighting sweaty through the stadium lawn in wind and weather?
In fact, e-sports has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - including big stars, millions of fans, and massive, high-pay tournaments.
This has also been recognized by the first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly involved in this area.
VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015, followed by FC Schalke 04 and most recently VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game.
"We hope to inspire completely new young target groups for VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann.
He is certain that "there are still several clubs on this train".
This coming weekend, the world football governing body FIFA organizes in London the first "Interactive Club World Cup", in which the gamer of different clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"The real football must deal in particular with the 14 to 30-year-olds, that the young people in the future even go to the stadium," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-athletes under contract, one could be present on these markets far more often online than to send the Bundesliga team to Asia only once a year.
What is it exactly?
In e-sports computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or even the football simulation FIFA are fought on the competition level.
Lions have long since established themselves, as in normal sports, in which the pros compete against each other.
And at the Asian Games 2022 E-Sport is already part of the official program.
But is it at all a right sport?
For many, the idea is sure to get used to.
Also Ingo Froböse has long dealt with the question.
E-Sport is a sport for the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne because he is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classical sports - for example increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
In addition, it needs cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick response.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console, but also their body and pay attention to the diet.
"The fit player is a good player."
Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming an issue more and more".
Controls are difficult to implement in online games, and the scene lacked the structures of classic sports.
The scientist positively emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sports.
The players are traveling internationally, it's like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by the consulting firm Deloitte and the German Association for Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth for e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million euros had been transacted in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsoring and major tournaments.
In three years, the turnover should be 130 million.
That is little against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga.
However, the e-sport is "not far removed from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," write the Deloitte consultants.
Internationally, many countries are already on.
Big markets are Asia and the United States, where former basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez join US Team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider Unikrn.
Things are also happening in Europe.
E-Sport was introduced as a subject in a Norwegian school, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and in France, the first division football clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department, according to Dutt.
"In comparison to other European countries, Germany lags behind," explains VfB board member Röttgermann.
Only to fall into nostalgia, and to transfigure the old times, is no longer enough today.
It is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time aligning the company with the modern market.
"We live in a digitalized world," says Dutt.

Unfortunately, the European system of government art financing falls victim to slow economic growth and growing budget deficits.
An immediate deployment of an appropriate civilian and security presence during the months immediately following NATO's 1999 bombing campaign might have created appropriate safeguards against the backlash that turned victims into perpetrators.
One of these projects aims to provide developing countries with medical information via the Internet, another to provide communication equipment and experts for disaster and humanitarian emergencies, and a third to provide immunization coverage to significantly more children worldwide.
However, access to resources is just one part of the problem and I would like to reiterate the importance of denouncing the production, distribution and use of these indiscriminate weapons.
The Forum, which successfully concluded its fourth session in February 2000, deals in particular with forest issues in the context of sustainable forest management, addressing not only the causes of deforestation, but also the trade in forest products and the use of market-based forest conservation tools.
Through its Networking for Sustainable Development program and through partnerships with the private sector, the United Nations Development Program has promoted the use of free software and provided information on sustainable development in many languages.

Goodbye poison eggs - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
Almost all federal states are affected by the scandal involving poisonous eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have responded and taken all the eggs in Germany from the sale.
In the shelves, only eggs are to be taken, which demonstrably contain no fipronil.
In this performance-balanced match, however, Marcus Blasutto's TSV team was consistently in favor of the great physical commitment and encouraging commitment of both teams.
The Council is currently examining the extent to which these mechanisms are included in Article 7.
For example, we ask the rapporteur, the Commission and the Council to add the part of the fisheries policy to the agricultural part, for example by making the title "agricultural aspects of enlargement" "agricultural and fisheries aspects of enlargement".
Above all, I would like to address the Council, which is unfortunately essentially absent, but express some expectations and concerns.
It has now been tried by the compound feed industry again to influence the Council and overturn the open declaration.
I would point out to the honorable Members that the Council Working Group unanimously decided to recommend to the Council to set up a joint committee in the action program, which could increase the influence of the individual Member States through a combination of management and advisory procedures.
The report contains, in our view, a disagreement on the issue, which my group does not agree on, namely that the appointment of an internal auditor should be prescribed only for the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament, or even for the smaller institutions.
Here are two examples: The Education Council, linked to the mobility of students and teachers, because we have identified a great deal of inequality in mobility, and the Internal Market, Consumption and Tourism Council, in conjunction with the agenda item on the development of electronic commerce, to make it accessible to all women and men, as here too, as we know, there is an inequality between women and men.
So I have to admit that, as the Council and the Commission explained, this amendment is unfounded in this case, and would like to take the opportunity to recall that the procedures of import controls in the European Union are not working, that fraud is being committed and that these frauds are not only bad for the Community taxpayer but also bad for the functioning of the internal market and even fairness towards third countries.
The Commission and the Council will do their part, and that is the most important thing on Yugoslavia's agenda, which has always been our interest.
As far as the Intergovernmental Conference is concerned, the work before Biarritz at ministerial level had, I believe, already progressed as far as possible, and the informal Council was therefore timely in order to confirm certain progress in order to provide guidance for the final phase in which we now find ourselves.
Madam President, first of all, I would like to congratulate the European Council for having accepted the draft Charter as binding.
Fulfilling the demands of the big countries for more power in the Council and in Parliament would disturb the balance within the European Union and lead small countries to pay the full price for enlargement.
We must support the efforts made by Mr Prodi and Mr Patten to strengthen the Commission's capacity to act through parliamentary scrutiny and the necessary parliamentary scrutiny, which does not apply to the Council and Mr Solana.
Although we share the criticisms of the Council on many points, it remains clear that it would be a politically intractable confrontation and undermine credibility in European institutions.
I do not want to give the impression that the Council is not answering the questions that have been addressed to it.
The Council is actively involved in examining the Commission's proposal and the above-mentioned amendments in order to reach an opinion on this issue as soon as possible.
At that time, we did not know that the Council and the Commission had pledged aid from these funds for reconstruction in Serbia and Kosovo.
Mr President, the Council has really outperformed itself with the draft budget it presented for 2001.
In this respect, and also in view of the Commission's admission that Member States' payments to the Structural Funds for 2001 exceed the estimates of the PDB by 8 billion, I think it is time for the Council to seriously consider that we should do something about the payments and not increase the "RAL".
Incidentally, such support and signaling will also be required of the Council in due course.
Several proposals are already before the Council and the Parliament, such as the package of proposals for the recast and update of health rules.
That is why I ask the Council, which is not here, and the Commission, to communicate the importance of increasing this amount, since between 20 and 50 new ones are unfortunately placed for each cleared mine.
The waiver of the requirement for closer cooperation under the Treaty, the removal of the right of veto and the possibility of submitting the matter to the European Council, would be in breach of fundamental principles of European cooperation within the EU.
The General Affairs Council agreed in October last year on the first five action plans for Somalia, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Morocco and Iraq.
The committee responsible has followed me, and the signals from the Council are also very pleasing.
The Council will have to ask itself whether it has done more harm than good by awarding the candidate status to Turkey.
In June 2000, the Council adopted in Feira a common EU strategy for the Mediterranean, and the European Commission, having proposed and enforced the reform of the MEDA Regulation, has recently submitted a document on the intensification of the Barcelona Process.
The Commission and the Council express their willingness to do so.
What diplomatic initiatives does the Council intend to take to resolve Armenia / Azerbaijan's resolution of its bilateral differences and to promote their cooperation in the interests of rapprochement?
Secondly, in its reply to NATO, the Council refers to Pontius Pilatus, without commenting on the provocative violation of Turkey's sovereign rights by Turkey, which was expressed this time on the occasion of the NATO maneuver.
But other countries really want the compensation fund, and I have to tell you quite frankly that if we were to propose a compulsory introduction of the compensation fund, it would mean we could forget about it because there would never be a majority in the Council.
I would like to cite one example: while the ban on the export of unsafe products to third countries was known to cause difficulties for the Council, this ban is very important to the European Parliament and we fully support it.
The Garot report aims to improve the Commission's proposal in some respects by seeking a compromise solution with the Council, notably on financial participation in the Fund.
The Council of the European Union, in cooperation with your institution and the European Commission, also plays an active role in updating and constantly strengthening European legislation to prevent and control this disease.
The Commission and the Council of the European Union have a grave responsibility for the extent of the crisis in connection with mad cow disease.
Parliament can be proud that the proposal to build this academy was born here, and we are grateful to the Portuguese Presidency for taking it up, and we thank the Commission and the Council for their support.
The European Council is also preparing a declaration on the economic, social and cultural characteristics of sport and its social function in Europe.
His voice would be stronger, and the voice of the ministers defending agriculture for sustainable development would be much stronger in the Council too, if it could rely on decisions made in the co-decision procedure.
As requested by Mr Brok in his report, the Council will have overview documents listing relations between the Union and each partner country in order to make better use of the Union's overall efforts in order to increase its efficiency and to better prepare its debates on external action.
In addition, I would like to say that, in the context of all the Council-related positions, there is no European Union budgetary commitment to finance any military activity.
Furthermore, it is utterly illogical that only the Council can amend the Financial Regulation, and we repeat our request for conciliation on this point.
On many points, as Mr Watts has already said, the European Parliament has a stricter stance than seems to be the case in the Council.
There were also discussions with the sectors concerned and there were numerous contacts with the French Presidency with the aim of reaching a consensus text that could be swiftly adopted by the two legislative bodies, the Council and the European Parliament.
I would like to say to Mr Jarzembowski that the Council is not seeking a compromise.
"It is clear that there may be an incompetent and provocative official, but if 15 Member States agree with such answers, you, Madam President, I think you must take the initiative and urge the Council to respect a prerogative of the Members of the European Parliament.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that with the debate on proportionality (votes in the Council and seats in Parliament), that is, on the balance of power between the Member States, a pandora's purse has been opened, which will be difficult to close in Nice.
The report has been the subject of difficult discussions in the Council.
I have been told by my chairman of the Committee on Budgets that it is the first time ever that an agreement has been reached between Council and Parliament in a Conciliation.
Ultimately, it was the voice weighting in the Council that was the subject of the most heated debate and where the hardest part was to come to a decision.
As a representative of the groups affiliated to the European Free Alliance, I would like to warn the Commission, and especially the Council, in case the EU does not want to be more than an intergovernmental community.
But the Nice European Council, like many other summits in the history of the European Union, represents a victory of reality, a victory for pragmatism over utopia.
If the Council wanted that, he would act carelessly and unwise.
Second, has the Council obtained information from the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights, who is well represented on the ground?
What improvements does the Council intend to make to Directive 92/12 / EEC referred to in order to clarify the responsibilities of the supplier and the recipient, without the possibility of fraud?
According to Article 23 of the EU Treaty, such a decision is taken unanimously by the Council, as are all other decisions with defense implications.
Mr President, as rightly stated by the Groupement Européen of the Sociétés d'Auteurs et de Compositeurs, the draft we are discussing here was attacked in an excessive fashion during its consideration by the Council.
Secondly, this topic will be on the agenda of the Telecommunications Council next Friday.
At the trialogue meeting, it became clear that the Council was not prepared to make concessions on this issue.
The precautionary principle was also discussed at the Nice summit, which took note of a resolution adopted by the General Affairs Council.
The 2001 budget is largely based on a compromise between Parliament, the Council and the Commission that we support.
The Nice European Council had a positive aspect: by deciding on a new weighting of votes and a new distribution of MEPs, including the Eastern European candidate countries, he gave them the strong signal of their readiness to accept them as soon as possible.
Michelle Carter convicted of the lyrics that condemn Conrad Roy to suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her friend through suicide texts and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months in prison and five years in prison.
Carter was convicted of careless murder in June by Conrad Roy, who died on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was allowed to stay free until appealed.
She was faced with a maximum of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy were suffering from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and eyes down when she was convicted.
"Your actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She has not taken any responsibility, "she said.
"She has shown no regrets".
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "terrible circumstance she completely regretted."
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said he did not find out that "age or maturity, or even her mental illness, has a significant impact on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, stating that "there is not a day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and to handle everything, trying to be there for his sisters in spite of all the pain we will carry with us for eternity, "it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was "persecuted" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
"Not having the single person I've been with every day since I was born is a pain I'll always keep with myself for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to call on another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hanging up, jump from a building, stab yourself, I do not know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention by Roy's death and ordered that she should benefit from the case through some press.
The case shared the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before being acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not jail."

Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini lame Bayern
It's no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was capped at the Audi Cup.
FC Bayern trusts the Confederations Cup winner a great season - extra motivation does not hurt.
There was something different about his place in the cabin, Joshua Kimmich saw immediately, even though the extra garment was very, very small.
But as there was no Philipp Lahm or Manuel Neuer on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, he put his bandage on his arm.
"The coach has not announced it," said the Confed Cup winner afterwards, after his first assignment as Bayern captain.
Well, the debut could have gone better than the 0-2 against SSC Napoli.
But the sign from the coach could also interpret Kimmich.
Not the eight-year-older Arturo Vidal had been selected as captain in the consisting of youth players, debutants and just come off the holidays professionals C-Elf, but he.
Sugar is best distributed to those who are trusted to do a lot, who want to keep their spirits up.
Anyone who has been chosen to take on the legacy of Lahm, can use a little extra motivation just fine.
Kimmich confirmed: "That's what you want as a player: take responsibility".
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old darted across the field as a mini-lame.
Right back, that's his position now, the white bandage on her arm did the rest.
And at all Kimmich worked in this starting formation as the one who can take the helm also in the best hand.
He gave instructions, tried to direct the uninitiated troop.
He had an eye for the whole while many others were self-absorbed.
Vidal with overplaying his lack of fitness (barely working), Renato Sanches, hell-bent on continuing the Asian journey (did not even work that way), and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle not stinging their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
That worked very well after all.
Süle ran next to Kimmich, Rudy before the defense, both acted sovereign.
The well-known Napoli storm was often difficult, also tried Süle also in the game structure a couple of times successfully.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not what we had hoped for".
But he also showed a decent performance in the debut.
Game relocation, change of tempo: "For this style, I was also brought".
How unusual this Bayern world is still for the newcomers, you saw after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two in the catacombs, but certainly did six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said goodbye to some crisp statements in the back of his new teammates.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "What's going on here, I've already noticed.
At Bayern you just have to win every game ".
After all, he does not have to teach the new one anymore.
Alaba motivates ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's best-known footballer has reported on Twitter shortly before the game and wished the ÖFB ladies all the best.
The Bayern legionnaire is almost a club colleague of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and feverish with our ladies.
The tweet of the Austrian Footballer of the Year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational injection.
The famous Bayern-duffle might be well needed by our ladies.
In court, it became known that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests discovered Class A drugs in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
The court learned that he had called important drug traffickers, some of whom he had previously represented, for significant arrests and informed them of what the investigators knew about them.
We will find you and bring you to court.
In court, the defendant initially alleged that he was suffering a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan had died in an explosion next to him.
The court did not have to hear any of the injured women anymore.
The court also reaffirmed the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and also held that the Health Act requirement that states either expand access to Medicaid or otherwise cancel all Medicaid state funding would not be unconstitutional.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered in front of the court to cheer for the new president, and unlike the presidential pageantry of the Mubarak era, traffic was only briefly stopped so that the car convoy could cross the typically busy street connecting the city center with the southern suburbs.
But with the deposition of the official oath before the court and not as usual before the parliament, he bows to the will of the military, which indicates that the power struggle will continue.
It is difficult that rockers in court almost always adhere to an ehernes for their law - and do not testify.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economy praises Wissing's pace
It was often irreconcilable that the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Trier Enterprise Association (VTU), says: "Wissing is picking up on the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked".
The biggest turnaround sees Natus in the infrastructure policy: The gap closure of the motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now in the priority list of the country at the top.
This year, the Ministry is hoping for a plan approval procedure, by 2021, the construction law should be.
A role in the plans of the country also plays the west by-pass Trier, which stands in the urgent need of the federal traffic route plan.
The goal is to start the route in December 2020, says Ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a signpost to support regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier, as suggested by Wissing, is aiming for a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports, which have been declining for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praises the IHK.
The Chamber of Crafts Trier sees in the new master bonus an additional incentive for young apprentices, says managing director Matthias Schwalbach.
A bonus of 1000 euros is required for the passed master exam and 2500 euros if graduates start their own business within ten years of master craftsman training.
The homework list for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction to quickly create facts, at the same time it lacks the country's necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, CEO of the Chamber of Commerce Trier.
Of the 56 new engineers that Wissing plans to hire at the State Mobility Office, only 29 positions have been filled so far.
The CCI demands to place more orders to external offices.
CDU parliamentary group Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors, the country invest in 2017 and 2018 less than 20 million euros less in the preservation of national roads than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country, as it wants to solve the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
Sobering is also the previous broadband expansion in the country.
In 2016, regional companies rated the grid supply in an IHK survey only with a grade of 3.4.
They complained about stagnant internet connections and crashes.
Ex-Minister of Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke, however, is currently out of politics and sits on the board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Greens left Lemke in April to become the president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where, after four months, she had already cleared the field due to disagreements.
These lessons have been learned so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly began to change course due to the low birth rate and aging population this summer, and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their response was immediate and final: "By no means".

Audi is to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a backlash
One day before the announcement by Audi, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the companies as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emission regulations.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost of installing automobiles to neutralize the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with coddling the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which allowed the use of so-called shutdown devices that could regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car was tested, but drive back in normal driving conditions.
Several employees of Volkswagen have been charged in the United States, others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of Thermodynamics in Audi engine development in Germany was arrested.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focusing on the United States was expanded.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could seriously affect Volkswagen: The luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen.
Instead of helping in the Röszke camp immediately with the establishment of structures that guarantee humanity, our Chancellor has unofficially and publicly brought the attitude of the Hungarian government into the vicious circle of National Socialism.
When the negotiations started six months ago, it was Britain's turn to take over the presidency of the European Council.
This is exactly what the European Commission recently did when it presented its first post-Kyoto strategy, which the European Council will discuss in March.
The Commission's task is to oversee the practical application of this legal framework in the context of its role as defined by the Treaty.
Therefore, I think it entirely appropriate to entrust this task to an external and morally unassailable authority.
That remains a task for the future.
Madam President, it has been raised what could be the task of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
Enlargement has given you and us all the same task that Monnet and Schuman and others fifty years ago were facing: to develop a method, a structure and a vision for the future of Europe.

And this is not a common raft, with Isar tourists.
But the building department wants to enlighten.
On the raft you can see a big infotransparent.
It shows a garbage mountain.
The prelude to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True love is ..." is intended to sharpen the understanding of the Isar river as a protected river.
Already last summer the raft crossed the Isar and this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behavior.
The European Monetary Cooperation Fund (ERDF), chaired by a Governing Board made up of members of the Committee of Governors and a Member of the Commission, is primarily responsible for ensuring the functioning of the European Monetary System (EMS) created in March 1979 as a substitute for the "snake".
However, this monetary mechanism of the EMS differs from that of the "snake" in that the EMS was accepted by all the Member States (with the United Kingdom and Greece not yet participating in the intervention mechanism), so that it is a Community system.
However, this monetary mechanism of the EMS differs from that of the "snake" in that the EMS was accepted by all the Member States (with the United Kingdom and Greece not yet participating in the intervention mechanism), so that it is a Community system.
This was the mechanism known as the "snake in the tunnel" (European currency snake).
The "snake" represented the narrower range of variation allowed for intra-Community currency exchange, while the term "tunnel" meant the larger range of variation allowed for the exchange of Community currencies in dollars.
Meanwhile, the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (established in 1973 to manage the Queue in the Bandwidth Mechanism) continues to serve as the forerunner of the new institution.
It is forbidden to hunt, catch, disturb, kill, kill, kill, live or kill animals that are completely protected (in Upper Austria these are the most birds and snakes and all lizards and amphibians).
Banotti just a little, that he cares more about snakes than about horses.
He did a lot for our snakes, but he did not care about our horses. "
I have too much respect for the dogs, let the snakes hiss, our caravan goes on with the calm certainty that every non-European invasion in the West was followed by a Poitiers, a Lepante, a Vienna.
OBJECTIVES (c) In 1972, the "snake in the tunnel" mechanism reduced the fluctuation margins between the Community currencies (snake) versus the ranges between these currencies and the dollar (tunnels).
The price stability mechanism was joined and resigned, and the snake, originally conceived as a community-wide agreement, was reduced to a zone of currency stability around the DM.
(Snake) to ± 2.25% and the fluctuation margins between these currencies and the dollar (tunnel) to ± 4.5%.
Community rolling of 2.25% (the "snake") was continued by the original Member States of the Community and Denmark, and the fluctuation margin of these currencies against the dollar (the "tunnel") was limited to 4.5%.
The return of the French franc into the queue, the relatively satisfactory functioning of this system and the introduction of a European unit of account have been characteristic of this development.
In 1975, negotiations on the inclusion of the Swiss franc in the "queue" were conducted in order to contribute to greater exchange rate stability in Europe.
The logical consequence of this was that there were always difficulties in the foreign exchange markets: the French franc was eliminated from the "queue", sterling and lira had to suffer heavy price losses in the international currency markets, and the German mark was revalued to relieve the queue.
Re-adjustment of intervention rates within the "queue", the central rate of the DM is revalued by 2% compared to the EUA.
Within the "snake", two exchange rate adjustments were made, both relating to the Scandinavian currencies.
While fixing the prices for 1978/79, this frontier adjustment was reduced, but increased again as a result of changes in the exchange rates of the floating currencies and revaluations within the queue.
During the start-up of the system, non-snake member countries may opt for slightly wider bandwidths over a limited period of time.
What remains unanswered is whether it will be able to resist the ups and downs that brought down the "snake".
The former "floateten," the latter were included in the queue and could only fluctuate within a given framework.
In the EMS, the unit of account used for the "queue" is replaced by the ECU, which is equivalent to the value of the EUA and therefore approximately 21% below the value of the "snake invoice unit".
However, the United Kingdom and Ireland, followed by Italy, are leaving the "snake".
However, the European Ruth also has undeniable successes: the British renegotiations of 1975, the generalized direct election of the European Parliament and, on 12 March 1979, the introduction of the European Monetary System (EMS), which replaced the "snake".
This construction became known as the 'snake in the tunnel', with the swings between the common currencies forming the tunnel and the IMF's allowed outer fluctuation limits forming the tunnel.
The three candidate countries, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark, joined the queue in May 1972, but were unable to comply with the discipline and left the queue after a few months.
At the beginning of 1974, France and Italy also left the queue, which thus consisted of only a small number of currencies under the leading position of the Deutsche Mark.
This was the birth of the "snake in the tunnel."
The snake was thus half as wide (2.25%) as the tunnel (4.5%).
It was also decided that interventions aimed at keeping European currencies in line should, in principle, be in European currencies, while dollar interventions should only be allowed to prevent the snake breaking out of the tunnel.
The EEC Commission then proposed a common floating of the European currencies against the dollar - that is, the retention of the serpent, which should however leave the tunnel - including the possibility to change the parities within the queue within certain limits and under certain conditions.
In September 1974, Fourcade, the French finance minister, proposed a plan for "co-ordinated floating" of all Community currencies to achieve closer coordination between the five queued currencies and the four separate floating currencies.
As a starting point, he recommended the previous snake, but wanted to surround it with a kind of broader and more elastic "boa", which would include the European currencies outside the queue.
This outer shell could have larger bandwidths than the snake and include any currency entry and exit option.
In December 1975, in his report on the European Union, Belgian Prime Minister Tindemans developed a series of proposals to consolidate the snake, which should be of a Community nature and extend their impact to the key areas of economic and monetary policy.
According to Leo Tindemans, reinforcing the serpent should also encourage the gradual return to international monetary stability, with the first step being to create larger stability zones in the world, which would keep exchange rates stable.
This target zone for the floating currencies should gradually move towards the line as the weighting would shift in favor of the snake.
Some may not see anything in the European Monetary System other than an extended and rewritten "snake."
As with the snake, membership in the EMS is also voluntary.
Although France, Italy and Ireland have decided to participate alongside the former snake countries (ie Germany, Denmark and the Benelux countries), in 1978 the United Kingdom decided to stay outside the exchange rate mechanism, which is the essential part of the EMS.
Participation commitments are broadly similar to those that existed within the queue: one currency may fluctuate at most by 2.25% on both sides of its bilateral parity relative to another (however, for the Italian lira, this range is currently 6%).
- The difference between these two ECU rates serves as the basis for calculating the deviation indicator, which is a novelty of the EMS compared to the snake.
It has long been debated whether the duty of intervention should be determined in relation to the ECU or using the parity grid in the example of the snake.
However, those Member States that were not members of the "queue" in December 1978 (namely France, Italy and Ireland) had the option of choosing larger bands of up to 6%.
- Internal monetary policy measures: These include, in particular, interest-rate policies that directly affect the movement of capital and can help ease tensions, as experience with the "snake" has shown.
The mechanism of the deviation indicator has therefore brought two important changes to the snake system: for the first time, there is an objective basis for initiating consultations between competent authorities, which goes well beyond the mere fundamental agreement of consultations left to the initiative of the participants.
The entry into force of the Basel Convention introducing a system of reduced bandwith in the EEC - the quota (2.25% band) in the tunnel (+ 2.25%).
The pound sterling, the Irish pound and the Danish krone join the snake.
The Danish crown leaves the snake.
The Italian lira leaves the snake.
The Norwegian and the Swedish krona join the queue.
The Swedish krona leaves the queue, depreciating the Danish and Norwegian krone by 5% against the EEA.
Norway leaves the queue.
Chapter II summarizes these earlier attempts, from the formulation of a series of objectives in the Treaty of Rome to the concerted floatation of certain European currencies in the "queue."
Chapter III details the content of the EMS and its mechanisms (exchange rate and intervention mechanism, role of the ECU, credit systems), highlighting in particular the novelty of these mechanisms compared to the "snake" and analyzing the conditions for proper functioning in abstracto.
During the start-up of the system, non-snake member countries may opt for slightly wider bandwidths over a limited period of time.
Two areas of Community activity have so far been excluded from the scope of the EEA: the transactions of the European Monetary Cooperation Fund, denominated in EEAE, a unit of account based on the central rates of the snake's currencies, and the common agricultural policy, which used the "representative rates" whose national currency equivalents were set by the Council's decision.
The candidate countries also join the "snake".
The English and the Irish pound are leaving the line.

Mordillos Knollennasen and the laughter against the suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most popular cartoon draftsman, the knollnose of his characters are his trademark.
Even at 85, the Argentinian still draws and is working on a film.
His message: laughter, "because there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932, the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the early years as an artist, he struck, among other things as a draftsman for greeting cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day I lost my job," he once said.
After stints in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough in the late 1960s: with the release of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, roundish Mordillo figurines cavort in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
According to his own statements, he still sits at the drawing table in the early morning, working almost ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, T-shirts, stuffed animals and watches his droll figures continue to find widespread use worldwide.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a television series with his characters.
The main character in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos most beloved animal in his drawings - that has a centipede as an opponent.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D movie, which is scheduled to hit the big screen in 2019.
"I'm not sure what they're going to say, it's weird," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
Therefore, he relies more on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced without a word.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends € 1 to fulfill its obligations, France gives just 10 cents and understands it as a comparable operation.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining because of drought-prone conditions and insect-borne insects, causing major headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Argentine agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the fall.
This has an effect on the life of lavender.
There is also a small cicada, a microbacteria that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "
And there is a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts tourists, it is also in great demand for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said, "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened ones.
So we have less parts with essential oil. "
Solutions that are considered include better water distribution and slowing of evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to dryness.
We wanted to win and we won, though I'm sorry we did not score one or two more goals. "

The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
The weekly Riodoce staff usually meets on Wednesdays to review their plans to report on recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organized crime, corrupt officials and perpetual drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: take their children to the office who were targeting a grenade attack in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the mess of Mexico dangerous.
There is no respite from the violence, and as corpses pile up across the country, more and more journalists are present: at least 25 since Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far this year there were at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter are their publisher and inspirer Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt even though his presence is everywhere - a large photograph of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building, and two reporters in their thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared issues, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to deal with cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two criminal cases were initiated.
As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organized crime every year, journalists' killers are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are heartbroken and even though the terrain is even more tell-tale.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting has little use for discussing security, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"Unless we know the why, we distrust everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men and was forced out of his car and shot at him 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - translated as "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a wife and two grown children.
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum.
It does not matter that in Sinaloa every day one or more people are shot in the street or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "calm" when only one cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was blamed for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This release may have annoyed the sons, assuming gang members purchased each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newsstands.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez, after confiscating another newspaper that had published the same story, to leave the country for his own safety.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He joined Noroeste in 2003 as an experienced reporter when he teamed with five colleagues to found Riodoce and sold $ 50 in equity.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without encountering the drug problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for brave and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to publish hard-hitting research without fear of censorship, and readers were intrigued by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after founding Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Prize" for her coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in prosecuting the Mexican drug story wherever it went.
He freely admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to go on living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV.
"You have to do the job that comes to you as a journalist - either that or you're playing the dumb.
I do not want to be asked, "What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did not you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the joker who cursed like a docker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for routine his ruin?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They do not like dealing with their wives, their kids, their clean shops, their secret runways," to get drugs.
"These things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best of times, is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells bad, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell makes sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - as well as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees came for safety training, mobile phones were suddenly not allowed, and days before it was announced that spyware sold exclusively to governments was being used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen were sheltering from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Half joking, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of police officers whom the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountainous landscape where the drug gangs are in fact under control.
For this week's edition, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the assassination of the brother of former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an Exposé to the government spending, which focused on the home town of the governor.
And there was a group that kidnapped one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, one block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened, so caution was needed when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite spot for drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled all political levels for almost the entire century.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at this place, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers had viewed Valdez's column as the most informed source about the kidnapping.
"We used to know what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender physique.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken."
Valdez's office was rededicated as a storage room for signs and stickers protesting journalists' killings, because employees have become something they themselves never expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to the prosecutor's office the next morning for a demonstration for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burnt body has been discovered and officials say it's based on DNA testing.
Throughout the country, journalists have become more vocal, writing "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
On this day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington trying to gain international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
She has since requested that she be reassigned by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.

Dinosaur used camouflage to dodge his enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening one.
Now researchers have found that the first insights from the incredible rhino of a Canadian miner have been so well received that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa the Dinosaur".
It was so well preserved that they even found his flaky skin was reddish brown - and they said she had had something of a "troubled past".
The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaur that lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the mid-Cretaceous.
His incredibly well-preserved condition has astonished researchers who describe it as "truly remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivore is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He struck something that seemed out of place by the surrounding rock and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) clod.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you just blink a little, you might almost believe it slept," said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this herbivore, though it is covered with armor and resembling a walking tank, was probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to mix better with its environment and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it has been threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million year old creature of the Nodosaur family first made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of dandruff and armor across his body.
They discovered the counter shading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although the counter shading is common, the results are surprising since the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favored concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals using the counter shading - think of deer, zebras, or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodosaur was facing a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the Cretaceous dinosaur predators must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut content, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he was caught in a river and driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"This Nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with conserved flaky skin, but it is also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early Cretaceous.
You do not need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it, and if you just squint your eyes, you might almost think he's asleep. "
The Cretaceous was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs, criss-crossed the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of its fearsome ancestors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six-ton monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank in the sea after death and was mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the world's best preserved armored dinosaur, including skin and armor, and is complete from snout to hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tips that protruded from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored herbivore was swept through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well-preserved that the remains of the skin still cover bumpy armor plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armor plates that carry the animal's skull.

In the thunderstorm: pile-up on A8: many injured
Violent accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Almost 30 vehicles are involved in a pile-up.
There are many injured, miles of congestion - and gazers.
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8) about 20 people were injured in a pile-up on late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police, around 5 pm between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg district) during a thunderstorm, nearly 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, crashed into each other.
At first, no information was available on the exact number of injured persons.
It was about mild to moderate injuries, said a police spokesman.
A large contingent of emergency vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of Munich formed a backlog about ten kilometers long.
As an AZ reporter reports, there were also massive obstacles on the opposite lane - due to numerous gazers.
The fire department noted down the license plates of vehicle drivers, who now have to expect sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18:45 there was a second accident on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
It had come to a collision between a car carrier and a car.

Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "comfort check-in"
It's a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced before: unaware, you sit in the train and sleep.
Or one is absorbed in his work and has just a brilliant idea.
And then: puff.
If the conductor comes and wakes a rude or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow.
Ticket inspection.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the ticket-free ticket inspection.
You simply confirm by cell phone that you have taken his place and thus validated the ticket.
Currently running a test operation on two routes.
"If the offer, we expand it.
It will then probably be available early next year on many other long-distance transport routes in Germany, "said a railway spokesman.
"Comfort Check-in" the train calls the ticket cancellation without conductor.
To be able to use them, however, some requirements have to be fulfilled: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to book an online ticket - which is what most passengers do anyway.
You also have to buy it via the DB App, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way to book a ticket anyway.
And finally you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: You get on the train, call up his ticket under "My Tickets".
For test customers then a button for electronic validation appears.
The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the train attendant at the ticket inspection at Y place he knows that there sits a passenger with already valed online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, continue working, keep silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the railways - which in turn should be used by the passengers.
"Anyone who wants to travel relaxed without our ticketing control by train attendants simply checks in the DB Navigator himself.
This allows passengers to personalize their travel time on the train, "says Michael Peterson, Chief Marketing Officer of DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to cater to individual customer needs."
Those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, the ticket inspections are among the biggest annoyances.
Often you do not have all the documents you need to validate online tickets, but in any case one of your fellow travelers.
Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document that you have to present is missing.
The result is endless discussions between train conductor and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the compartment or metropolitan area and delays in controlling their own ticket and the conductor takes in the end to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And that only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.
Just one day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis-born sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled over a post from someone in high school.
"The police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," it said.
Confused, since no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on her timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis area was tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out in the street, where he would stay for four hours.
"That's wild," thought Ferrell.
But death was nothing new to them and their community.
She dropped her cell phone to return later that evening to tweets about people on Canfield Drive.
There were photos of the police band and people shouting and a man claiming to be Brown's father with a sign saying, "Ferguson's police have just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed with a policeman standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another cop armed his rifle and shouted, "I'll kill you ... all animals."
"That's not common," Ferrell recalled from her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder we got used to and that we can call typical."
At that moment, I felt chills.
I was angry and cried. "
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 pm, she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", In the cinemas from the 11th.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and of loss, of strength and of the power of resistance that exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a matching crown, they discussed a conversation they had "countless times before this morning" about the black experience and the black state.
"You remember how I taught you, when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" She remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right.
I could not take her with me, "Ferrell later said.
"What happened today is a culmination of ... what happened in the past.
She has to know it and see it and be raised in it.
It needs to be well-developed, not just to know activism and organization, but also to know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution, and what we need to do to become free to liberate ourselves.
Although I am fortunate enough to give her an experience that personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black woman child.
I feel like I'm doing her a disservice, keeping her from doing so. "
The first stop when they arrived at Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police department, which became a camp area when activists waited for the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter joined forces with a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism has changed completely after 9 August," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association, focusing on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has come. "
Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.
Folayan said she and her cinematographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what was happening.
A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can take advantage of?"
This skepticism has been fueled by countless human cases, often by whites - in a community that has benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently stated in an interview, "We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had previously worked with then-co-director Damon Davis, an artist well-known for his activism around death row inmates.
His involvement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" In the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us, we talk," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people are portrayed, because that's how I'll be portrayed."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement is "not a messiah leader, but a community that comes together," Folayan said - proving she was the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" Reveal surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said, laughing as she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understand that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanizing of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's story reiterates the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who coined the movie "BlacklivesMatter" on social media following the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have supported the movement as a whole," Ferrell said, "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women have to bear the brunt of everything. "
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really upheld by black women and many black women".
However, she insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action," in which Ferrell was chosen for her identity as the heart of the film.
"She was the person who roused this energy," she said.
"It's no coincidence, though she was at the front line because living at these intersections is so much at stake as a black, gay woman.
You can feel their energy through the screen. "
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial ties between the community and the police continue.
Ferrell is on probation for 2½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area that she calls home: "Chaos".
Nevertheless, she clings to a song and she feels obliged to remember it since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains. "
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
"Not in front, otherwise we will block, and not all yellow caps on the same benches, distribute in space!"
"Very little space has remained in the city's ownership and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
Avalon Bay has announced a few months ago, paving the small street and set up seats, which are, among other things, intended for a café, to which the company wants to rent space.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face recognition system, this 'receptionist' can see how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, they can listen and understand the key words of their conversation.
From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss about Bit-Galerie
The Bit Gallery moves people, though it is far from being built.
But the idea of a shopping center at the southern end of the pedestrian zone divides the population into advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
The topic barely leaves one cold.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While some say to the Bit-Gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "No human needs" (Siggi Betzen) or simply "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).
While the proponents rely on a gallery attracting more customers to the city, which also benefits the rest of the shops, the opponents fear that then the pedestrian zone bleeds.
In addition: The gallery is planned exactly on the property, on which stands the farmers market hall, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will be the end of the construction work.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - to the Beda Square with possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying almost weekly at the Bauernmarkthalle for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of country women always happy.
We also discovered the butcher shop for us.
We would hope that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery has a chance to maintain this offer.
In other cities, too.
Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of the rent.
That might not be low for the new project. "
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I think that's superfluous.
There are already enough in our city.
You can see how many stores there are empty - some for months and years.
Since there is not even a proper weekly market, it is even more important that at least the market hall is preserved.
For after all, the goods offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is on top of that cheap.
As you can see, shops in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often unsustainable for a retailer.
Too bad, there are almost no special shops and what's left of it will probably disappear. "
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping center with a market hall does not suit me.
And the gallery does not fit Bitburg.
Above all, where should the farmers market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit-gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the ghost of Bit-Galerie manage to evict all businesses from Bitburg before? "
George Marquet: "That just will not work.
And nobody needs a shopping center that is empty.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market instead of this gallery.
But for a farmer's market hall there is no place thanks to the insanely many - as I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg.
When the farmer's market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again. "
A fitting resemblance: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent snippets from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year prison sentence after she made public secret messages on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and groundbreaking dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he only had three days left.
Dewey-Hagborg has created a sharp, if somewhat intellectual commentary not only on the malleability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and created by 30 portraits of how anyone might look with this genomic data.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has been openly talking about being a woman since puberty, was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.
Her image was suppressed by the prison, so much so that there was only one photo-a grainy, black-and-white selfie in which Manning was clearly uncomfortable sitting in a driver's seat wearing a platinum blonde wig-with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came back from the great success of their 2012 'Stranger Visions' project.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the garbage to create a picture of what these people might look like.
That was when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg told a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she could not visit at that time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequaled pen pals who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a "Suppressed Images" comic illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the president would transform Chelsea's verdict and be able to see the exhibition in person.
Indeed, the fact that Obama would demand Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas only days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy coincidence.
There is also something profound and deep at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is conducting a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions he was supposed to fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a reason".
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with her oversized signature underneath (the "i" in her surname has a heart), called for an end to the "automatic fragmentation of which sex, race, sexuality, and culture were based."
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's highly developed scientific lexicon) how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people will hopefully take away is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also on display.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of those stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the comic novella mentioned above.
It shows Manning emerging from the disciplinary barracks of the United States, such as King Kong, with a hands-free phone in his hand.
"If they put down your speech, then they won," they say.
"So never shut up".
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose bumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet personally seen the exhibition - as anticipated in the comic book - but if she does, she'll be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, her own genomic simulacra, gathering like hordes of protesters.
That was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, right up to the size (5 "2, Manning's stature), where her genetic haplogroups were written in pencil.
"In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind her liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford wanted for killing
A nationwide manhunt is under way for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University who are being sought as suspects after a man was stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago.
On Monday, Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, were arrested for murder on their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the Cook County Court records show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several bites.
A community warning system published by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officers received a phone call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead on the scene, and detectives investigate the tricks as murder while the police are actively seeking the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem is now on leave and has been barred from entering the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal matter, which is being investigated by the relevant authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is a Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we're in contact with the police in the UK and we're ready to help the US investigative agencies in every way possible."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urges the suspects to face the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts and our efforts to locate them are increasing," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities help find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a phone call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a puzzling hint that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management team issued a statement to the residents: "Police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim, exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving back to those who made sacrifices.

"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not be long before the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) are implemented.
"At a certain stage of meeting the timetable criteria, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA Roadmap has been updated in this regard, "Mutko said Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap for adherence to the code, which describes the criteria for reinstatement of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.
However, one of the criteria in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
As for the matter, Mutko said, "We are carrying out the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we will not admit something that does not exist. "
Mutko's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
Speaking to the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted that the past was a problem in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
Nobody plans to unconditionally accept this report, "Smirnov added.
RUSADA was excluded from conducting doping controls in Russia in November 2015 as part of the doping scandal by WADA.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After visiting the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA General Director Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA is "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.

(Unless otherwise indicated, all prices of Toys "R" are US.)
Nevertheless, he foresees a slump in interest rates, which banks are trying to offset by raising fees and loan prices.
Even if he assumes that the war on liabilities - which penalizes interest margins - will abate, the risk premiums that banks and savings banks have to pay for their emissions to maintain liquidity are already being passed on to the price of credit as compensation for dwindling profit margins.
"They would like to go out, but they pay close attention to prices," he says.
The business will do well for those who "offer quality at good prices with good service," he adds, reminding us that customers are saving in times of crisis, which is why prices are in the strongest 25 euros.
"If you place an advertisement and there are only a few applicants, your prices will skyrocket."
"But the idea is that it's not the price that matters, it's the expertise of the people," Laporte said.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer, according to the higher price of the products.

Such an agreement should enable the organization to meet, through its approved suppliers, the demand for low enriched uranium as nuclear fuel and spent fuel reprocessed at market prices and to provide a guarantee for the uninterrupted supply or provision of that service, as long as no breaches of safeguards or inspection procedures are found in the installations concerned.
During the negotiation of such an agreement, States should voluntarily give up a temporary moratorium on the construction of such enrichment or reprocessing facilities without the non-proliferation treaty granting the construction of additional enrichment or reprocessing facilities, whereby the moratorium obligation would have to be met by the supply of fissile material at current market prices by the current suppliers.
The scientific breakthroughs in biotechnology and the widespread existence of biological agent production facilities limit the prospects for biological weapons disposal and make verification more difficult.
During the negotiation of such an agreement, without giving up the right to build enrichment or reprocessing facilities under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, States should voluntarily enact a temporary moratorium on the construction of such facilities, with the moratorium guarantee being met by a guarantee of fissile material supply at current market prices by the current suppliers.

Aldi does not sell eggs for the time being
This was announced by the corporate groups.
It was a mere precautionary measure, it could be further assumed that no health impairment, it said in the message.

Unless we have an urgent debate, this matter will be followed by the end of the line of motions for resolutions of the political committee, as was the case with the resolution on Pakistan, which was not yet discussed by this committee after three months.
Every minute of the working day, another five people join the queue, the ones waiting for unemployment benefits.
The fact that the pleasant sounding term "common market" does not mean much is demonstrated daily by the long truck queues at the internal borders of the EC.
In the United Kingdom, this distribution took place under inhumane conditions, as retirees had to queuel as they did in the 1930s to get their free package of butter.
Logically, this causes inconvenience, since the snakes of non-French travelers - contrary to the idea of "grandeur," which has probably inspired the official who invented the system - are much longer than those of the nationals of the Member State to which the said airport belongs.
In addition, the veterinary service ensured that trucks transporting live animals or perishable food were dispatched outside the queue, that the animals were watered and provided with veterinary care and delays were minimized.
In fact, some are seriously hampered by blocked roads, and I was more than irritated when I had to wait in line at a military post.
For example, voters who lined up in 1000-meter-long queues were sent home in the evening because there was no electric light.
With the number of members of parliament, I have long seen queues waiting to use their card.
The proposed free movement of persons, which should come into force in 1993, and with the controls and uncivilized queues at the borders, certain bureaucratic practices and the presentation of passports
Part of a carriageway, which may be marked by longitudinal markings and which is wide enough for a line of motor vehicles other than motorcycles.
The conduct of these checks requires that commercial vehicle drivers carry extensive documents and wait in queues at the customs offices until it is their turn.
For every job vacant in Sunderland, there are 2,792 unemployed workers, and more than half of the 1981 school leavers had not found work when the 1982 graduates were already queuing for jobseekers.
This last point may seem superfluous today, but so soon after the "Bad Time," which lasted until the 1950s, every politician was all too aware of the empty shelves in the bakeries, the ration cards, and the long queues outside the grocery stores.
In the United Kingdom, the practice is very different, that is, there are really personal conversations, as well as the so-called "cattle market," where teachers sit at tables in the school hall and parents queued to exchange a few short, more or less meaningless words with the teacher in question.
With adequate content, citizens would "prefer to work online rather than stand in line," said Liikanen CORDIS News.
However, by the end of 2000, consumers wishing to pay in euros often stumbled upon cashiers, who, unused to it, had to consult with their superiors in order to settle the payment, while himself drawing the impatient glances of those waiting in line.
That's why the snake.
The motto of "eGovernment" could be: "Better sit by the computer than stand in line," because eGovernment services are supposed to enable the simple handling of public services over the Internet, so that we no longer have to queuing in the office.
Therefore, airplanes are often forced to make a long detour to reach their destination or "queue up" for the use of the corridors.
The EU-funded project SCULPTEUR is opening up new avenues for visiting major European galleries and museums so that endless queues and tired feet will soon be a thing of the past.
The check-in procedures need to be streamlined and simplified so that long truck lines no longer obstruct the border traffic between Kaliningrad and the neighboring regions of Poland and Lithuania.
As a result, long lines form on the winding coastal road that leads to the village.
We are becoming increasingly aware of the loss of quality of life that we experience from traffic congestion, waiting in lines and standing in front of closed shops, libraries and public authorities.
The speech had not been discussed with Obama, a meeting had rejected this with reference to the then-forthcoming election in Israel.
And there are many reasons why he should fight in a general election.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters consider Clinton the best candidate to win the election, but that figure has dropped 78 percent in the last month.
She would find it better if he did not win the election because "he has such radical views, I do not know if that's good".
The start-ups that will help your business not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the happiness of her e-commerce start-up with her employees, but the polls did not work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful or, even worse, fraudulent.
And even if she promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There just never was consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new breed of Human Resources start-ups is growing to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software with the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, target specific groups and demographic groups, provide anonymity and complaint hotlines to employees, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass C-suite executives and contact the board directly.
"They now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" Said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said that she gained a better insight into what her employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it features a company heat card that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval scores - so you can drill back into why.
Companies come to realize that they must stay at the forefront of workplace culture so they will not become the next Uber involved in scandals ever since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment that punished those who spoke.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020, according to Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a heightened interest and activity discredited early this year in the midst of the Uber case.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized "pulse" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view the heat maps of their problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And when the chief executive is involved, complaints go straight to the board.
"The court of public opinion has seized the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent.
If it finds a company that maltreats its employees or behaves unethically, it can have costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee turnover, and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Previously, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she needed to find a phone number or e-mail for the corporate office, file a formal complaint, and hope it was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays general counsel, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, problems previously hidden by executives seated in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices - can be more quickly identified and addressed.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of employment experience," said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies began to take ethics, values, and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed on ethical violations of the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took a long time for the "social media to come to their rights" that companies realized they could not stop their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service and burden companies with recurring fees for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both startups.
Convercent received $ 10 million in February financing from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising total capital to $ 47 million.
Glitter secured $ 10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $ 60 million.
These investments come as no surprise given the networked nature of business, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing body of research showing that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just stakes.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they are giving their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be in a company, feel their voices heard, and the work they do is worthwhile, they feel more committed to making that business successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience on LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies perform well, and companies run well when employees are committed and committed.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase engagement and engagement, it's no wonder they find support.
The data on the employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture important.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company take no action.
In fact, when a business employee asks for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change does not come fast enough, or not at all, it can lead to disappointment and demotivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies rely too much on collecting data.
"Because if you do not follow employees will ask," Did you really hear me?
Do you take care of that?
And who you do not care about, why should I? "
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate action on the same day when reporting a problem with Glint, Errett said.
And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees, the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication enabled them to reorganize multiple teams within the company and add communication training to address the issues.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company continues to gain new insights about its employees, and hopes that, in the long term, this will result in better retention for workers in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you are not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And when you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose companies.

I know how soon the youth fades and the beauty fades, when in the goblet, which happiness offers us, there is only a drop of disgrace, a touch of conscience, and I want no sacrifice, no grief, no destruction - that is not to my liking.
This sight of the sufferings and sacrifices of another turned my mind away from the exclusive consideration of myself.
"Jane, I want to be a brother to you-my sisters will be your sisters-without you sacrificing your just claims."
Maybe I would not have to bring him this sacrifice for long, because only three months would pass before his departure.
You might decide to stand by my side, standing by my chair-caring like a good little nurse, (for you have a loving heart and a generous soul forcing you to make sacrifices to those you are suffering) and that should no doubt suffice me.
"Because you're happy when you can make sacrifices."

It was a very gray day, a dull sky hung with snow clouds cascading over the landscape, every now and then falling snowflakes that lay on the hard-frozen paths and bushes and trees without melting.
Again I looked out, past a church, saw the low, broad tower looming against the sky, its bells announcing the fifteen minutes, and then I saw a narrow line of lights on a hill, a village or a hamlet.
Behind and above the summit of the mountain the arch of the sky spread, deep blue as at dusk, and into the sky rose the bust of a woman, painted in soft and indefinite colors, as I had been able to put together.
Under this sky and above that mountain peak blows a violent storm.
I love this day, I love this leaden sky, I love this peace, this silence, this freezing of the world in this frost.
In the kitchen, in the storeroom of the cellar master, in the hall of the servants, in the great entrance hall, everywhere the same life, in the salons there was only peace and quiet, when the blue sky and the halcyon sunshine of the beautiful spring weather called the guests out into the park.
It was a warm, lesser, but no bright, hot summer evening, the meadow workers were busy all the way, the sky, though not cloudless, promised good weather for the days to come, its blueness - where it was visible at all - was mild, and the clouds were high and transparent.
I do not know if it was a beautiful, clear or a rainy rainy day, and as I walked down the big driveway I did not look up to the sky or down to the ground, my eyes were at my heart, and both were now at Mr. Rochester's.
It seemed to say, 'My splendid visions are wonderful, but I must not forget that they are completely unsubstantial.' In my brain I carry a rosy sky and a blossoming, blossoming Eden, but I know well that there is a rough path out here, which I must walk through, and black storm clouds gather around me to defy.
But I neither looked up to the sun, nor to the smiling sky, nor down to the awakening nature.
I looked up at the sky, it was clear, a friendly star just sparkling over the top of the cliff.
Perfect beauty is a strong expression, but I do not take it back and do not justify it: trains as sweet as the temperate climate of Albion ever scribbled them: colors so rosy and lily-white as ever produced and flowered under this cloudy sky, in these humid winds, in this case justify the name perfect beauty.
I stared at the bare wall, it seemed to me like a sky dotted with bright stars - and each one of them meant happiness, bliss, action!

He raised his hand and opened his eyelids, straightened his eyes, as it seemed with great effort, to the sky, then looked at the amphitheater of the forest - but for him it was all emptiness and darkness.
I led him out of the wild, damp forest into the sunny fields, I described to him how lush green they were, how refreshed the flowers and hedges looked after the rain, how sparkling blue the sky was.
Even now he is not yet able to see very clearly, he must neither read much nor write, but he finds the way without being led by the hand, the sky is no longer a colorless surface for him, the earth is not an empty space.
"And just when I chose the tallest tree in the forest," the dove continued in a raised voice, "and just when I thought I was finally going to leave, they must even wind down from the sky!
Alice laughed so loudly that she had to run back into the bush for fear they would hear her, and when she looked again the fish-putty was gone, and the other was sitting on the floor by the door, stupidly looking up into the sky.
It was not quite finished, the gray roof was visible through the uncovered attic.
By now the sky had turned quite blue.
And if we climb up to the cathedral, without stopping at the thousand barbariums of all kinds, what started with the pretty little tower, which leaned on the apex of the cross vault, and which leaned as boldly and boldly as its neighbor, the tower of the holy chapel (also destroyed), but higher, sharper, sounding, and richer than the towers towering into the sky?
Only here did this domed structure appear as the boldest, freest, most elaborate and most jagged tower ever to show the sky through its broken cone.
This is evident and listed in terms of our cold and rainy skies.
And when he opened the window of the cell, he pointed with his finger to the mighty church of Our Lady of Notre, which in the starry heavens lifted the black outlines of its two towers, its stone faces, and its mighty roof-back, and resembled a monstrous, two-headed sphinx sitting in the middle of the city.
Beside the bed was a window, the broken slices of which resembled a spider's web torn by the rain, through their broken curves revealed a patch of sky and the moon, resting in the distance on a down pillow of delicate clouds.
In this passionate declaration of love, the gypsy woman sent a look of heavenly happiness to the dirty blanket that represented heaven here.

At his feet some chickens pecked through the bushes, crawling the gold beetles in the sunshine, groups of fleecy clouds passing over his head in the blue sky, the tower of Sanct-Victor abutting the hillside with its slate obelisk on the horizon, and the windmiller on the Copeaux hill whistling as the working wings of his mill turned.
The sky was pale and so was the water of the river.
Here it was only Claude, who stood upright, and the obelisk which lay, but as the river reflected the sky, increasing the depth beneath him, the immense promontory seemed as boldly swung up into the void as every Minster's tower, and the impression was the same.
The façade was shrouded in darkness, with the sky sparkling in the starlight in the background.
The air was cold, clouds were moving in the sky, their great white waves streaming over one another as they crumpled at the corners, representing the ice drift of a river in winter.
She came slowly toward him, her eyes raised to the sky.
The air, the sky, the morning, the evening, the moonlight, my good friends the tramps, the funny pranks with the girls to study the beautiful monuments of Paris, to write three thick books, one of them against the bishop and his mills, and God knows what else?
To whom do you owe it, that you breathe this air, see this sky, that you can delight your lark's head with silliness and antics!
Over this flame were seen the monstrous towers, with their two rising and garishly contrasting fronts, one dark and the other entirely red, which seemed even larger at the monstrous shadow they cast in the sky.
The forecourt gleamed and threw a ray of light toward the sky, the pile of wood fired on the platform still burning and illuminating the city far away.
The sky was completely pure.
In the mist, the waters began to stream, the ice broke, and the floes moved faster, the murky, foaming rivers streamed faster, and just on Sunday after Easter the evening broke, the dark clouds dissolved into white lamb clouds, the sky cleared, and then spring broke.
He stood and listened and soon looked down at the damp, mossy earth, soon after the attentive Laska, soon after the sea of bare treetops, which spread out before him at the foot of the hill, soon after the darkened sky strewn with white clouds.
As they spoke, Laska pricked her ears, looked up at the sky, and then gave the two hunters a reproachful look.
She immediately drew him into a conversation with the genuinely French exuberance of kindness, praising him happily for having such a most lovely daughter, and lifting Kitty straight to heaven, calling her a true treasure, a pearl, an angel of consolation, though she stood there.

I was just looking up at the sky, and there was nothing there but two white stripes.

The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It's approaching 11pm as a lot of UCLA football players talk on one side of the campus's new practice areas.
Some have taken off their jerseys and show their backs full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes are a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 am the next morning.
"This is a real treadmill for the guys for the next three days," said Bruins coach Jim Mora just before Monday turned into Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminated two-day exercises to relieve the burden on players, and it actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, UCLA's first three training sessions should begin at 19:15 to meet players' already packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day on which the Bruins postponed the start of the camp nearly a week after the last season, and during the summer school conducted practical exercises for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 exercises during August 20 prior to the start of formal game preparation for their Texas A & M kick-off in September.
Mora said he supports the rule change of the NCAA, even adding another point to the busy routes of the players.
"We put this huge load on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging," said Mora.
"And they just pushed it through, they keep getting stuck, they're great people.
I think once we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great. "
UCLA will terminate its practices as soon as the camp is over, which will not be an easy task given the clear line of sight of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Luskin Center, an upscale hotel already pitched with footballs clearing a protective net behind a goalpost.
Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel this weekend, but Mora acknowledged that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are vacant during the season.
"We will use our security," said Mora.
"This is a real problem, and it's not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then prepare to record an exercise there.
If you have the videotape of an exercise, it's a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in the parking lot 8.
We will do the best we can with what we have.
That's why I'm not too worried.
We have a plan. "

Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential false news articles to third-party fact-checking auditors and then report their results below the original post, said the world's largest online social network on Thursday, one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false reports and send them to fact reviewers who may be able to view results from fact checking from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many believe has influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks for failing to quickly eliminate hate-filled postings, such as before the September elections there.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review will be launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to finding out which stories are challenged by third-party fact checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook News on a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its "related article" feature and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news.
Creating a Comic Novel: A Castle in the History of England
In its recent past, little Scotney Castle was featured in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970's and 1980's.
But Scotney has seen 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy base in the Bewl River Valley in Kent, and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mopheaded Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I think it's so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who's been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
"What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' spans the time from the Middle Ages to the Edward Age and documents the families who lived in Scotney, each story illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It's not Rhodes's first archival-based book: In 2014, he wrote Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I responded only to the thumbprint on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell of smoke, because then they lit a fire because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has the effect of being there as well.
Oh, I love archives! "
For someone so defeated with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest, I overstated my welcome a bit"), all this seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, going through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle, talking to landscape gardeners, gardeners, and sometimes to the artists working on the illustrations in his book.
Then, at night, he drank "whiskey and started writing".
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown as the National Trust did not receive full access until 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees were just starting to look at the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years when aristocrats said, 'Oh, throw it in the attic.'
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps depicting who owned what: "One might think land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch tree fought over by the two families.
Guys, let everything go its course! "
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to more fully immerse themselves in English history, including 'The Laborer', which follows a man leaving the newly-built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred at the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising started in this area and I thought a rebellion was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected? "
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', depicting the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who staged his own funeral by filling a casket with stones (a discovery made years later when his coffin was dug up).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite Scotney family: "The gentlemen seemed to be pretty crooked, always in debt and spending money on things they could not afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I think of them as a bunch of handsome boys with a talent for recruiting. "
After completing his mission at the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He spent a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with the damned life again."

Ministry wants to rehabilitate route for Rennsteig shuttle
The future of the Rennsteig shuttles has been contested again and again in recent months - now things are going to be very fast.
Before the end of the year to be built on the ailing track on which the tourist train drives.
In order to secure the future of the Rennsteig shuttles in the long term, construction work on the line is scheduled to start this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to continue to order and rehabilitate the route Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country is committed to this especially important for tourism connection," said State Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of repairing the track, he estimated at about 2.5 million euros.
From this sum the country takes over 75 per cent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle will also be ordered by the state in the future, is currently being finalized, Sühl explained.
The ministry and the Südthüringen Bahn as operators are already in agreement on the technical details.
"This negotiated the timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years.
The Rennsteig shuttle should be ordered regularly on December 2017.
The Rennsteig shuttle is a popular tourist train between the train stations Ilmenau and Rennsteig.
Over the past few months, a pilot operation has tested whether the line is used by enough people to order it again in the future.
The track is also heavily dilapidated in parts.

Madam President, there are new victims of ETA, but there are also new victims of Spanish repression: new arrests, new tortures, relocations of prisoners imprisoned in the Basque Country.
Firstly, it concerns the method, it is a feeble and obscure process that in effect excludes the other institutions of the Union and in which governments fall victim to their own labyrinth.
Many victims are small children, terrible impressions, horrible mutilations, destroying the path of life before it really starts.
We need to ensure that those who have innocently become victims of the fight against crime - perhaps we should call that collateral damage - are not completely isolated from their loved ones in the prisons.
But in the face of this crisis, we must guarantee both health and food safety for consumers and the income of livestock farmers, as well as the incomes of butchers, tripe dealers and wholesalers, all of them victims of negligence on the part of national and Community authorities.
Appropriate measures must be taken to ensure the following rights for victims of crime: the right to contribute and receive information, to ensure communication, to participate in the procedure and access to free legal aid, adequate protection of the person and privacy, the right to criminal compensation and the possibility of dispute settlement through conciliation.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just when you thought it could not get any crazier in 2017, there's a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yes, indeed.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) released a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take her ascent seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
"People make fun of them, but companies are spending a lot of it, and we'll see them much more often," Mr. Sharkey said when publishing his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberate human responses achieved through artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customize" his robot according to his beliefs, choosing anything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it gets even more disturbing as many robots possess the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have become robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to customize their robots to the features they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there's the True Companion-developed Roxxxy Gold sex robot with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shyness, and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that's as adapted as possible to your personality," enthuses True Companion's website.
So she likes what you like and she does not like what you do not like, etc.
She also has her moods throughout the day - just like real people!
She may be tired, fixated on conversation, or she may be "in the mood!"
There are many disconcerting aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive feminine features, the allusions to rape, when one takes a step toward frigid (meaning reluctant) Farrah, are the most disturbing to one.
On his website, True Companion compared Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can not men have Roxxxy then?" Says the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.
Of course, most men will not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notes their rising popularity, they are still on the verge of consumer culture.
But what transpires from the fringes can be very instructive in the spirit of the time we live in.
And many people are not weird or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is some overlap, however, that these sophisticated sex robots are emerging at a time when the rights of women worldwide are threatened, with the White House having a president who has boasted that she has sexually assaulted women.
The most daunting aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' is not the graphic images, the tangled bodies and the eyes that have been dropped out, but how realistic this vision is.
The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but right now it does not feel like a big jump.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to imitate the movement of a real body.
But, in a nutshell, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots are not real women.
You can not leave her companion or just walk away.
They have no mediation or background story, nothing that points to independence or anything that might disturb the fantasy of total submission.
In other words, they are compliant slaves.
Or to put it in the phrase of 2017: maid

Although they love Le Mans, the "Green Hell" of the Nürburgring Nordschleife or Indianapolis, Monaco's GP circuit remains unparalleled.

What do prices mean to you?
We are happy about any price.

Why you award a prize that is more highly endowed than the Nobel Prize?
The prize is intended to honor outstanding achievements.
In addition to the amount of money, the prize consists of a performance with the Vienna Philharmonic at the Lucerne Festival.
But I do not believe that such prices are groundbreaking for your own artistic development.
Without these prices I would hardly have developed artistically and aesthetically much different.
First and foremost, a prize signifies a great recognition that you would otherwise only receive in research for important publications - with the difference that such an award, unlike a publication in professional circles, shows that your own work is also perceived and appreciated by people who are not part of their own area of expertise.

Trump's big achievement?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have also split families in small format.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers in the US with advice on how to handle the horror of Trump's choosing relatives.
We all allegedly work hard to burst our filter bubbles.
Less noticed is Trump's power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been dealing with the Republicans in our family, visited me in New York this week.
It reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the republican kinship with whom she had fought for decades over politics, is suddenly and strangely on the same page.
This is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but in a wider context, it also comes with a lot of risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we are referring to the scary possibility that one day his antics will not repel us.
However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing right-wingers, who suddenly seem to be the embodiment of reasonableness compared to their standards.
I find myself in an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the madman these days - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, in comparison to Trump, are in fact very mild offenses.
If Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will only have to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest carousel in New York's park department, and the top three bucks you can spend in the city if you do not need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are growling and the animals are twisting to look fearfully over their own shoulders - very dark and the jingling music does this in a weird way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings are getting old, the skylines are getting too familiar to cause a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite through the day, when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big roundabout in North London.
However, the Central Park carousel is still a strangely magical experience as two two-year-olds, one 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go for it and everyone has a great time.
If I could rate the merry-go-round, I would have given him the full score, but thankfully nobody has asked for it.
On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could run my credit card.
It's the same in the coffeehouse on the corner of my street, plus the option of matching the rating with a 15% tip - to buy something over the counter.
Not only does this slow down what is supposed to be a neutral exchange, it also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is needed.
The poor woman in the store stood grinning apologetically as I tiredly experienced handing her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius with chest pain from prison moved to the hospital
Pistorius left the prison for a second visit to the hospital.
Last year, he was hospitalized for treating cuts on his wrists, which he reportedly suffered after a case in his cell, according to the prison authorities.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by the prosecutors against a first manslaughter verdict.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her repeatedly through a toilet cubicle door in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he considered his girlfriend a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius appeal, which they say is too lenient.
The National Law Enforcement Agency said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal can be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if prosecutors succeed.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.

Our calculations have shown that Cora has raised prices in the "Napi" cart over Christmas prices by 15% over the past year, while Tesco and Auchan have each increased by 18%.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, there has been a catastrophic price increase, with the price of daily hypermarket consumables rising by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores are no longer looking at prices.

Overall, prices rose 3.0 percent year-over-year.

Articles 1.2 (j), k) and l) of the Staff Regulations contain the basic provisions governing the issue of the acceptance of decorations, medals, privileges, gifts or benefits from posts outside the Organization (see Code of Conduct of 2001, paras. 46 and 47).
The old Article 1.6 regulated this issue in a provision banning the acceptance of any benefits from a government and severely limiting the acceptance of benefits from non-governmental agencies.
With the wording of Article 1.2 (j) he proposed, the Secretary-General wanted to express his view that the General Assembly should emphasize the importance of the impression of strict independence and impartiality of staff, and thus reaffirm the absolute prohibition on accepting benefits of governments.
The Secretary-General shall inform all Member States in writing of this principle of organization in the matter of accepting decorations, medals, privileges, gifts or gratuities in order to avoid incidents where possible.

When farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberger schools, the fourth graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were dismissed into holidays and secondary schools.
Three of the discharge students will go to high school in the future, four to secondary school.
Headmistress Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of the school's dismissal, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle that grows up in the Hühnerhof, but is then released into freedom.
The lively crowd led a musical titled "The Eagle in the Chickenyard".
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and hatched it from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chick, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making him a chicken broke, the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and vanished.
After that, classes three and four in the rehearsal of Yvonne Frank showed a chicken dance.
The hens danced with the young rookies who carried cylinders to the bet.
The Eagle stands for the integration, said headmistress Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different than the other young animals (chicks), but belong to it.
He will never be like a chicken.
His destiny is to be free.
She wished every fourth year that he feels accepted in his new school.
This was followed by a word of thanks to the colleagues, the former headmaster Michael Müller, who keeps coming back in the event of tense teaching, and the parents' representatives.
The chick time is now over, said class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She reluctantly dismisses her students after two years of teaching, because it was a really great time.
In the end she could have relied on the fourth graders.
At the end all students had a song of summer time and holiday time sound.
It broke with the children great joy.
Eight first graders have already registered for the new school year.
"Miss Wyatt," said tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by the TV, said.
On the morning of 1 August, police arrested a group of illegally camping people in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day while an investigation is in progress.
The Foreign Ministry reported to bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened their control over free camping and imposed significant fines on anyone who was found to stay in a place that was not intended for this purpose.
The controls will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court can impose a fine.
First, because some young people do not take advantage of these cheap cards anyway, as they would not listen to classical music at any price.
But Bayern, undefeated in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.

Software update for diesel vehicles: What the affected now need to know
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the campaign?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the emission behavior of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.
Euro 4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have cheat software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofitting has been ordered by the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA).
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a swift implementation in the next few months, but have not yet specified a precise date.
Daimler has advised to write to each affected person.
If an inspection is due anyway, it will be done within its scope.
How long should the retrofitting last?
"Hard to say," says Smetanin.
That depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and the political pressure.
"Because we have seen, voluntarily act the automakers on the subject of the environment so far."
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do motorists do who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?
The ACE advises to wait.
Presumably, foreign manufacturers would follow suit, Smetanin said.
Is now threatening a massive price decline of Euro 4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
But in the regions where driving bans threaten.
In rural areas there are so far no losses in value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.

LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners does not want to come - in protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rappers to receive one of the coveted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center.
The cultural institution announced Thursday that singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honorees this year.
The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the ceremony with his wife Melania.
As a result, laureate Lear, who became known for progressive TV series, has already announced that he will refrain from participating in the gala.
He said to the New York Times: "This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of the means - and that puts a strain on me".
Estefan, 59, said she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view.
Named after former President John F. Kennedy, the Kennedy Center is the largest cultural institution in the US capital.
Previous winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.

He is one of 16,000 Egyptians convicted by military courts since the Higher Council of the Armed Forces became the de facto ruler of Egypt.
For a year now, the Supreme Council of Armed Forces (SCAF), the Egyptian military council, has been abusing Egyptian women in a despicable though not irreparable way, sexually, physically and mentally.
The government was forced to found a council to write a new constitution: a group of citizens - without politicians, lawyers or university professors - who made the discussion process accessible to all and managed to work out by consensus a preliminary proposal.
In any case, we can start by analyzing the list of candidates, making some conclusions about them, and predicting who will get a seat on the council.
At the moment there are 142 registered candidates for the 45 seats in the Council.
Although there has always been a gender imbalance in the protest movement, the candidate list for the Council reaches a new level of imbalance.
While some opponents have criticized the voting process and the results, many (if not most) members of the protest movement have welcomed the Council as a triumph of cooperation and mobilization.
In the near and distant future, the Council will most certainly continue to comment on similarly sensitive issues.

We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslachs city master builder, will retire next year.
The position has already been announced - but suitable applicants are rare.
Wacker has been a city master builder for 31 years.
And the work is still great fun for him, as he conveys in the press conference.
He reports on varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.
At the same time he is surprised that so far no application fulfills the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible date.
So should - taking into account the regular notice periods - still be enough time for a training.
Since Haslach acts as the lower building authority for the administrative community, the applicant must have appropriate degrees.
Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.
If she could not fill these out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But proximity to the city is important to the city and to itself, says Wacker, who reports on a good working atmosphere and a good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, several significant projects have accumulated, which Wacker proudly looks back on.
"We make the city worth living", he is sure about the building office and his staff.
But also in the future, varied projects are on the agenda: The redesign of the former Hukla site and the Niederhofen parking lot, for example, have been initiated.
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, the stadium renovation is still an issue.
The latter alone will cost around 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," estimates Wacker.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun. "
In terms of design, there is a lot of room for a city architect.
With Haslachs own yard and nursery can be reacted to quite a lot of flexibility.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the layout of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town as an ensemble is a listed building, it is important to have "an eye for what fits", when new buildings are approved, stresses the outgoing city master builder.
In any case, the city master builder carries high responsibility.
He is the client, "in the end, everything runs over my table".
He can count on many years of service and coordination: Markus Neumaier (building construction) has been with us for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) for 15 years.
Also, that his successor remains long, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify with the job and stay".
Because continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere, but also for the further design of the city.
Anyone wishing to inherit Roland Wacker should, according to information provided by the city of Haslach, have a degree in engineering or a bachelor's degree in architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the field of building regulations and planning law.
The city construction office is subordinate to civil engineering, urban land use planning, land purchase matters, administration of the urban real estate, municipal depot with yard and city nursery as well as lower building right authority including monument protection.

Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to alleviate IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare to your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects about 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While people are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy to relieve their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that protein's essential amino acid tryptophan helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.
Lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, has stated that immune cells in the gut patrol to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not invade the body.
Cells capable of causing inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, it may result in inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments have found that a type of tolerance-enhancing immune cell occurs in mice bearing a specific bacterium in their guts.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said, "We have established a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more they had of these immune cells. "
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel environments, even though the same system works in humans.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that one group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain, but housed separately, did not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbiota of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and six species of bacteria were found which were present in the immune cell-containing mice but were absent without them in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked a gut microbiota and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they got the L. reuteri and immune cells formed.
To understand how the bacteria impacted the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's diet, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known if tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the gut.
Potentially, high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
Manchester United have signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Chelsea's £ 40 million signing began with a 2-1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday, and impressed in the holders' role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched on as they pleased.
Matic, however, had been excluded from the Blues' pre-tournament Asian tour and only managed 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he needed to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho formed his start XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more signings, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" fulfilling three of its four priority signings.
"To get three out of four, I thank the club," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they went to great lengths."

New low blow for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader, social democratic prime minister always looked before elections with some concern to Berlin.
But no interference from the party headquarters, just no headwind from the Bund - that was the main desire of the campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz leads the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the employees of the Willy-Brandt-Haus have watched the events in the SPD-governed provincial capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described as a headwind.
They were low blows.
One after the other.
The federal CDU sees after the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once more: Red-green simply can not reliably govern," said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising faction leaving a Greens deputies, the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) plunged into a serious crisis.
Five months before the state election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the CDU and FDP opposition.
The Green Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has called on the renegade Lower Saxony Green MP Elke Twesten to give back their mandate.
The conversion to the CDU means a clear falsification of voter will.
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate, "said the federal manager and campaign manager of the Greens the editorial network Germany (RND).
"That may not be true," sighs an SPD campaigner, as on Friday morning, the new bad news reached the party headquarters.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, stands after the transfer of green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU without own government majority there.

And nobody knows what's next.

Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
Now also Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW emissions scandal and his role in the supervisory board, the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been in the criticism for some time.
Lousy poll numbers were added.
Nevertheless, or maybe because of that, Weil tried in the past weeks more and more to set the course in the federal government.
The endeavor of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin was not lost on comrades in the environment of Martin Schulz.
They allowed him to do so, because they promised von Weil a stabilization of the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
In the meantime, Weil is not at fault for the party-internal dispute over the Lower Saxon Greens.
And certainly not Schulz.
Meanwhile, the comrades strive to keep their own ranks closed.
Their anger is directed at the Greens, and especially at the renegade parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is unbearable and democratizing how Ms. Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Ms Twesten has not been elected to the parliament because of her persona direct candidate, but through the national list of the Lower Saxony Greens, the Lower Saxony MP continues.
The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary group, deplores an "undemocratic maneuver".
"The voters will four years ago was clear: The people have Stephan Weil made prime minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a leading candidate in the federal election, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU deputy falsifies the election result," Oppermann continued.
He demanded to clarify the background.
I want to know if there has been more or if there have been further commitments from the CDU Lower Saxony.

Against the strong Russians, we received a red card after an emergency brake and the subsequent free kick led to the goal.
This could lower the entry barriers for the app market and reshuffle the cards.
"The customs officers are not astonished when they stand a bit helpless in front of a 20-pound suitcase full of cards and I tell them I just came home from a swap meet," says Antarez.
Antarez kept himself busy with prepaid, sim and refill cards, but when profane banknotes from the supermarket finally took over the recharging of the call credit, it was over after about 30,000 calling cards.
Not infrequently Antarez gets the cards in batches.
"Ten years ago, my wife and I came across Starbucks cards in the US, and I liked them so much that I started collecting them right away, expanding my focus on cards from all men's stores and countries," says Antarez.
Worldwide, there is only one nation from which he does not yet have a map:
The smaller the circulation, the more remote or isolated a country, the higher the value of a card.
Well, there is not a tangible, reasonably stable market for maps.
"I send one - mostly foreign - fellow collectors 100 cards that are still missing, and I get from him 100, which I do not have yet.
As a rule, I do not buy any tickets, so, except for postage and travel to the file sharing networks, I hardly spend any money on my hobby.
"He could not give me an answer at first, but the next morning there was a sack of used maps on our breakfast table.
The whole hotel crew had contributed old maps.
In addition, he experienced support from various companies and businesses, where he has auditioned and put him now cards aside.
In total, the collection of Antarez comprises around 60,000 cards of all kinds and about 100,000 duplicates.
In a moderated workshop on total assets, all cards were put on the table and the replacement of the company discussed.

If you lose the duel 70 meters in front of your own goal, you still have enough time to defend yourself successfully.

He is not bad, but he should score more goals.

If, in a given year, one of the ACP States listed above is unable to deliver the total quantity fixed and does not wish to benefit from the measures referred to in the paragraph below, the Commission may allocate the missing amount, within the overall annual quantity, to the other ACP States to which that scheme applies.
The third paragraph regulates the application by the Commission.
However, the more important provision of Article 109j is contained in paragraph four:
It refers to a passage in the solemn declaration of the Stuttgart European Council of June 1983 (point 2.3.7, last paragraph):
At the end of the explanatory note, add the following paragraph:
However, paragraph 2 has a third paragraph, worded as follows:
What does this third paragraph say?
The last paragraph of the amendment suggests that the work should be carried out mainly through research contracts and in part by the Commission's Biology group in Ispra at the Joint Research Center.
I would therefore ask you, Mr President, to vote on the first paragraph separately from the rest of the text.
Rules of Procedure Article 14, paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 6 These paragraphs are replaced by the following single paragraph:
The explanations should be changed by adding the following paragraph:
The amendment to this paragraph writes hot showers during working hours
The explanatory statement on page 8 states in the last paragraph:
Either a single amendment replaces everything - and that was the previous procedure - or it is voted on individually on each paragraph.
However, it will amend that paragraph to make it clear that the tariffs must cover the airline's direct operating costs on the route in question and that State aid granted under Article 93 of the Treaty may be deducted from the airline's costs.
I would like to ask the Commissioner to confirm that the Commission intends to carry out the investigation referred to in the second paragraph.
That is why I also ask everyone present to pay attention to the last paragraph of this motion for a resolution, in which we recommend a joint study, to be carried out in particular by the Committee on Agriculture and Development, on all new aspects of the introduction of new techniques and products in the sugar sector.
The last paragraph of Article 3 takes up only the right of initiative granted to the Commission by the Treaties.
There is a paragraph in the agreement stating that the Council of Ministers should agree to fill the budgetary hole in 1984 and 1985.
As regards respect for human rights in the Community, the Council recalls that the Member States, when ratifying the Treaties establishing the European Community, approved the following paragraph of the preamble:
He assigns too much importance to a subcommittee of the Senate, which actually has no power at all, and does not sufficiently deepen the subject in the other paragraph.
The French version lacks the phrase "from the European Parliament", and thus the paragraph, which has been discussed in great detail in the Committee on Development and Cooperation, loses its whole meaning.
A paragraph in the resolution tabled by Mr Herman and his party colleagues, on the other hand, requires a comment on our part: we are surprised that the Commission's proposals are perceived as being short-term.
We have voted on the first paragraph of Article 102 (a), but, as far as I remember, we have effectively voted against the second paragraph.
It is certain that the house has accepted the first paragraph.
Then this paragraph was voted out with a committee majority.
An amendment introduced by me and adopted by the majority of the House is noted in the Minutes as being rejected, and finally, recital Β of the original resolution was miraculously transformed into a first paragraph of the main part.
The third paragraph of the last paragraph concerning the Committee on Budgets again contains the wrong translation in the German text.
It is forgotten in this paragraph that the Baltic countries are at present part of the Soviet Federation, that their authorities and their peoples know this very well, just as they know that the rhythm of the reforms depends on democratization in the USSR.
I refer here to Article 14, second paragraph.
But if we analyze this article, we find that, according to its first paragraph, Member States are trying to promote the improvement of, in particular, the working environment.
Due to a misunderstanding, 16 members of my group voted against this paragraph, two abstained.
But I realize that this would have had no effect on the final result, since the paragraph was rejected by a majority of 55 votes.
Can the Commission state whether it has submitted a report on progress in ensuring social protection in accordance with paragraph Β of Recommendation 85/308 / EEC (x) on social protection for voluntary development workers?
You certainly know that the first paragraph of Article 146 of the EEC Treaty, in its current version, reads as follows: "The Council is composed of representatives of the Member States.
Firstly, will the Commission accept this amendment, which is to abolish the second paragraph of Article 6?
Because, Mr President, in each paragraph it mentions the issues of the Kurdish issue, the Cyprus problem, torture, freedom of the press and trade union freedoms in Turkey, and that means that there are problems.
Secondly, it is true that the first paragraph of Article J4 of the Maastricht Treaty reads as follows: "The common foreign and security policy covers all matters relating to the security of the European Union, including, in the longer term, the definition of a common defense policy which could in time lead to a common defense."
Therefore, I hope that the Commissioner will consult with his colleagues over Christmas and urges them to anticipate my paragraph in the resolution in the new year.
This week had started well in the European Parliament, as we discussed, inter alia, the Barzanti report, in which the following paragraph summarizes the opinion of many Members of Parliament.

Funding for town center III
If you want to renovate your old house, you will soon be able to get support from the state.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives from STEG Stadtentwicklung informed this on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave a retrospective look at what has happened so far.
Since 1991 there are regeneration areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in redevelopment area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two-thirds of the funding.
In the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still at 60 percent.
For Schindler, the refurbishments so far are a "success project" - after all, it is important to also promote interior development, and not just to develop new construction areas.
On April 4, one received information from the regional council of Karlsruhe, that there will be a redevelopment area III.
The subsidy amounts to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros would come from the country, the rest of the community Empfingen.
How is a redevelopment area created?
According to Schindler, they will investigate where the "really old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role in whether there is any interest in the proposed area to redevelop.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could then shift again.
The STEG represented on Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-state program "Social City", in the context of which the redevelopment would then be carried out.
The core of the program is the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out object-related, that is per plot.
The redevelopment area would then finally be set as a statute.
The grant period for grants runs from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
However, until September of this year, first of all the inventory would be carried out, in the context of which the participants in the redevelopment area will receive a questionnaire to fill out.
In November or December, as far as possible, the statutes should be passed so that the refurbishment can begin in the coming year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality must carry out the said preliminary investigations.
It is about assessing the urban maladministration and decide when rehabilitation is and to what extent.
It will be registered for the respective property then a redevelopment note in the land register.
Pietzschmann himself would come to Empfingen again and get an idea of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel emphasized that a key success factor for the project was the involvement of the participants.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires, which will be sent to the citizens by mail in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and property sheet", which among other things is about the structural condition and the renovation intentions.
The gray questionnaire, the "Housing and Housing Sheet", provides information on the size, distribution and occupants of a living space.
The blue "farm sheet" is only to be completed when operating premises in the building.
However, it should be noted, pointed out Gotzel that a completed questionnaire is not an application for funding at the same time.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler stressed that the distribution of subsidies according to the "greyhound principle" work - who comes first, first served.
You can not reserve funds for later.
At the end, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown to make the renovation "tasty".
British inventor sets himself a microchip to come with a hand movement in the house and car
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so he can open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with a wave of his hand.
Steven Northam, 33, implanted the tiny chip between his thumb and forefinger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital at Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is performed to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cats and dogs implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company also wants to change the locks on homes and cars to be compatible with the chip, all for an additional £ 300 per lock.

White House advertising costs thousands of taxpayers
The White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting US manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $ 24,000, according to the military, given to TIME magazine.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior White House officials took a tour of products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut helicopter was displayed next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck, and a Mississippi forklift truck.
The White House military office demanded the helicopter's presence in a fragmented order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn, according to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of it, because it's such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his supervisor, the deputy marine commander for aviation.
The message indicated that the helicopter arrived at South Lawn at 3:00 pm on July 17 for the event at 3:00 pm, and remained there until the turf was cleared between 6:00 pm and 9:00 pm that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was to be delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the limitation of the hours of service.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel stayed with the aircraft while on the ground.
From the records made available to TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the determination.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked up," the deputy commander answered.
The event "Made in America" was called an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the president kick-started the health reform reform in the Senate and propagated efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.
But requesting their use only for a photo surgery is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane was taxiing against the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential plane.
"The White House is thrilled with the Made in America show - featuring products from all 50 states produced by American workers using American materials," said White House Assistant Secretary, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews frequently conduct training flights around Washington and South Lawn to set the US president in the White House at precise centimeter rates.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event was part of the flight crew's training needs for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units also flew 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said taxpayers were not taking on the burden of any of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company had not been involved in exhibiting the helicopter on South Lawn.
HMX-1 has no budget records for presidential flights, and it's difficult to pin down the exact cost of the event.
However, according to US Department of Defense hourly rates for the 2017 financial year, the DoH reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $ 24,380 per flight hour.
Records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
"Determining the cost to taxpayers based on estimates of reimbursement rates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funding."
According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursement rates do not include personnel costs but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contracting.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the helicopter's deployment for the event.
"The idea is to showcase things that are made in America this week," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly for.
It is, of course, appropriate to emphasize that. "
It was not clear if Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he entered the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire truck.
At the White House, Trump spoke to Sikorsky representatives and joked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of them."

How America can harm OMV

Roll backwards: The city is hiring 46 kitchen helpers
The city organizes the Kita lunch again.
With fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the municipal day-care centers.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld will again take over the food supply in the day-care centers for children (Kitas).
For Sonja Pommeranz, deputy head of youth welfare, this is good news: "We were all very happy".

The city runs 46 daycare centers in the Krefeld area, and 44 children have a hot meal at lunchtime.
In the past Kitayahr 2800 children sat at the tables, and the demand is growing steadily.
"In the meantime, it is not just children who are cared for 45 hours per week that have lunch at the kindergarten," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer is also valid in the 35-hour care, if children stay until 14 clock."
46 part-timers will be on duty from September 1 onwards: They will heat up the food they have delivered, add lettuce, raw vegetables and fruit, individually portion the meal, serve the food, clean it, rinse and clean the kitchen.

In Temple, Associate Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
At the University of Pennsylvania's main campus, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of art history and anthropology, formed a team to offer a course called "The End of the World".
"We will not record in 2012, so we always have the option to retrain the course in case the world does not go down," said Restall.
"There were no seats left in two hours," said Restall about his course for high-average students, which filled with 35 students.
The students for their part assure that the course is one of the most interesting.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have tried on Thursday to rob a 13-year-old girl.
According to information from the police, the men approached the 13-year-old, who was staying at Kolpingstraße with friends at around 14.55, because they wanted to talk to the girl's mobile phone.
The 13-year-old declined the request and went on with her friends.
One of the perpetrators then tried to grab the girl's cell phone and necklace, but failed.
Without prey escaped the duo.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigation is ongoing.

GMB concerns about investing in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A union wants to check with executives of biscuit maker McVitie about the long-term commitment to production at their plant in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company had been silent about the future of Tollcross investment.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.
McVity owner Pladis said he has invested more than £ 5 million in recent years.
He added that employees and union representatives "would be the first to know" if their activities changed.
In a letter to the store manager of the company, GMB Scotland asked McVitie's "to express concerns that funding for the modernization of production lines would not be pushed forward".
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we can not gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross affects our members deeply.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is heavily focused on the local community and Greater Glasgow, an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and wealth, and against the background of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow is in dire need of a thriving McVitie production presence. "
A spokeswoman for Pladis said, "The branch manager at Tollcross just received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly as we value the continued commitment of staff and union representatives.
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were openly discussed.
We discussed with employees that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our businesses - and this applies to all our businesses and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added, "In recent years, we have invested more than £ 5 million in our tollcross facility, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We wholeheartedly acknowledge the heritage of Tollcross as a manufacturing facility, and should our site operations change, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know. "
"My uncle Reed is in heaven and can see everything you do and say, and my father and mother too, they know you lock me up all day and you wish I was dead."
Only two or three days ago did I bury a little child of five - a good child whose soul is now in heaven.
"Let your light shine before the people, that they may see your good works and praise your Father in heaven." Ev.
And then my soul made the first earnest effort to understand what they had put into it in terms of heaven and hell, for the first time I saw nothing but an immense abyss behind me, for the first time my soul trembled, feeling and feeling nothing more than the one spot on which it stood - the present, everything else was a shapeless cloud, an unfathomable depth - shuddering at the thought of stumbling, shaking - and plunging into chaos.
"So you are sure, Helen, that there is something called Heaven, and that our souls will go there when we die?"
> Push him to the fourth finger of my left hand and I belong to you and you belong to me, and we will leave this earth and look for our heaven over there. <
She was near, and as I sent no request to Heaven to turn her away from me-neither folding my hands nor bowing my knee or moving my lips-she came: in great heavy waves, the torrent roared over me.
I could defeat the case, but the inmate would fly to the sky before I could still own the shell of earthly clay.
Without a doubt, St. John would have given the world to follow her, to call her back, withhold her if she left him like that, but he did not want to give up any atom of his claim to heaven, he did not want to give up one single hope for the Elysium of her true, eternal paradise.
But then she raised her old lament: "Oh, why did Heaven want it?
He regretted it, but then declared that in some respects the sick man must rejoice, for it was the will of the Lord, who would give him the opportunity to reconcile himself to heaven.
Clasped hands, she raised her head and looked up at the sky.
Thanks to the sky, he had happily survived this journey and arrived in Rome without an accident.
It's the sky. "
See, for a sign coming from heaven - for the sun is there - these thousand churches are shaking at once.
This young, fatherless and motherless brother, this little child who suddenly fell into his arms from heaven, made him a new man.
At the points where these currents intersect in the sky, they produce the light, at their cutting points on the earth they bring forth the gold ...
The creature which stood before my eyes possessed that superhuman beauty which can come only from heaven or from hell.
She turned her reddened and dry eyes to the sky, to the sun, to the silver clouds that were here and there divided by deep blue triangles and trapezoids, then knocked them down, looked around, at the earth, at the crowd, at the houses ... Suddenly, as the yellow man tied her elbows together, she gave a terrible scream, a cry of joy.
It is a death worthy of the sage, which has wavered throughout its life: a death that is not flesh and not fish, like the spirit of the true skeptic, a death that expresses all the doubt and indecision that holds the middle between heaven and earth, holding one in suspense.
The beggars shrieked, gasped, cursed, and ascended, and Quasimodo, feeling powerless against so many enemies, trembled for the gypsy, and saw the angry faces approaching his gallery more and more, begging heaven for a miracle and clasping hands in despair.
You will find it in heaven. "
As for Quasimodo, who had not stopped fighting for a moment, he fell down on both knees and raised his hands to heaven, then rushed away drunk with joy, and rose with the speed of a bird to the cell whose entrances he had so boldly defended.
Now and then, with puzzled glances, he looked at a sort of narrow slab about ten feet below the unevenness of the stone ornaments, and he begged the heavens in the depths of his frightened heart to allow him to settle his life in that room by two feet square: should it take a hundred years.
We mused together on such works as Grasset's "Ververt et Chartreuse", Macchiavelli's Belphegor, Swedenborg's "Hell and Hell", Robert Flud's Chiromancy, Jean d'Indaginé and de la Chambre, brooding over Tieck's "Journey into the Blue" and Campanella's "City of the Sun".
In Him alone we find peace and comfort and salvation and love, "she said, and began to pray, as Alexey Alexandrovitch shut her silence, with eyes fixed on the heavens.
Of these he knew none except Enoch, who was raptured alive to heaven.
Shortly before he had remembered all the names, but now he had forgotten them altogether, because Enoch was his favorite figure in the Old Testament, and in his mind a long line of thought followed the rapture of living Enoch into heaven, which he abandoned himself now, fixing his eyes on his father's watch chain and on a half-buttoned button on his waistcoat.
The agonizing state of waiting, which she, as it were floating between heaven and earth, underwent in Moscow, Alexey Alexandrovitch's slowness and indecision, her loneliness, everything she laid before him.
A heavy thunderclap came rolling down from the sky, tumbling away in the distance in a dull rumble.
Did the PSG Barcelona warn of Neymar three years ago?
The side of La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not relent in its persecution of Neymar after bidding £ 189 million to trigger its release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the world record raid?
The sensational approach has fueled the summer transfer window as the Ligue 1 club are ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous level, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for £ 89m last season.
Upon completion, Neymar becomes the world's most expensive player and the highest paid professional athlete in the world, with PSG offering wages of more than £ 500,000 per week.
Barcelona is furious with the way Neymar forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalan board insists that the club has always done its best to look after him since arriving from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect by the PSG president three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we'll be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players signed, it will have consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have crossed that line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the international from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar.

A course titled "Racism and xenophobia at work" was offered to three groups of District Administration staff.
This course was for staff with oversight functions, foreign workers, and teachers from the nursing profession.
The course was designed to create a positive working environment and prevent "cultural collisions", to ensure that staff members know more about each other, to better inform about political parties' agreements on immigration and refugee issues, and to encourage them to work through local action programs.

This shows, Madam President, that the bloody regime, which is supported by the military in the Grande, is taking a hard line against dissenters, for which we, all 12 states of the European Union, share responsibility, because even though Parliament has sounded the alarm several times, it violates not only human rights, but also basic democratic principles.

Positions at General Motors Overseas Corporation responsible for European sales, marketing, planning and trade relations.
HISTORY: The concept of tariff preferences is based on the recognition that it is particularly difficult for countries whose industry is still developing, i.e. developing countries, to gain a foothold in the markets of industrialized countries and to increase their sales there.
Such a market structure results in internationalization, because national oligopolies with a stable internal market are looking elsewhere to increase their sales.
Price reductions on exceeding sales figures: In France automatic price reductions apply to products whose sales significantly exceed the sales figures stated in the original price calculation request.
Common European standards also give the European car industry an important competitive edge over truck manufacturers outside the Community, as 57 countries have adopted EC standards in their national legislation, recognizing that they are also useful and practicable for their countries, promoting truck sales while creating thousands of new jobs in the Community that we so desperately need, Mr Collins.
It seems to me important to note that in the European automobile industry all firms had record sales in sales up to the beginning of 1980 and that the advance of Japanese competition had been anticipated for a long time, also by the European car industry, which perhaps believed in part that things continued to go so well without the need to make adequate efforts.
It will exacerbate intra-European competition, since even the Member States of the Community, which have hitherto attempted to restrict themselves to Japanese competition, will soon find that European suppliers will seek their way into the markets of these countries in order to secure the sale of their motor vehicles despite the increase in Japanese imports.
In view of increasing Community milk supplies during 1982 and the corresponding increase in butter production, the Commission considers that two types of measures are needed in the short term, partly to ensure a sensible disposal of butter stocks and partly to prevent the overgrowth of the Butterberg.
As you know, the Community in this area has fallen considerably behind in the last ten years, as its paragraph, which was then moderate, shows.
Both the Subcommittee on Technical Barriers to Trade and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs consider that the noise level of household appliances plays a role in sales and that this problem is solved by competition and market forces themselves, so that there is no need for legislation.
The Community consumer organizations, like the Socialist Group, have been tirelessly pointing out for years that only a move away from sales and price guarantees and a move towards genuine structural policy can put the vehicle back on the right track.

This initiative is all the more right as we are already aware of the campaigns to promote sales of olive oil and fiber, as Mr Fantuzzi has pointed out, whose sales in third countries have increased thanks to the support of ad hoc instruments.

Also, the fact that the big companies are weakened or even closed down contributes 10% to the buoyant development of small businesses and their share of sales in France from 1980 to 1988.

Tunisia's sales of manufactured goods are strongly concentrated in clothing and, to a lesser extent, in textiles (over 18% of total exports in 1979), partly due to the spectacular increase in 'outward processing' following investment by companies from Community countries, especially from Germany.
This could even lead, as is the case with the products of the North, to the Community displacing established exporters through subsidized sales on the world market.
Morocco, in particular, managed to redistribute its sales from France and the Federal Republic to the Benelux countries and Scandinavia, and above all to the USSR and Saudi Arabia.
This solution may have the merit of resulting in a less open Community commitment than revenue guarantees or guaranteed sales in the Community markets themselves.
Since in most of these cases employment has at least the same importance as the balance of payments, a better way of guaranteeing reduced volumes would be to obtain higher (possibly intra-Community) prices than before.

Of course, this program is not a panacea for European agriculture, but in individual cases it can help to open up new sales and income opportunities.
As long as the crisis persists, protectionism is often accused on both sides, a charge being made by lobbies encountering obstacles in the sale of their products or fearing that their market will be swamped with products that are no longer marketed.
Dutch exports, which account for a significant proportion (almost 30% in 1983) of basic materials and intermediate products whose sales are particularly sensitive to economic developments, could be encouraged, in particular, by current stockpiling.
This would be a considerable increase in volume, taking into account that the forecasts for sales on foreign markets in mid-1983 amounted to 440 billion m3.
In fact, demand for steel products is unlikely to increase, which should translate into a fairly slow increase in total exports, although sales of new companies will grow dynamically.
While sales of natural gas abroad continued to decline in relation to 1986, exports of finished goods remained relatively buoyant despite the strong appreciation of the guilder in 1986 and 1987.
With ministries continuing to control commodity supply and prices and guarantee sales, most management seemed more interested in maintaining a good relationship with the apparatus than in demanding new business freedom.
Furthermore, Parliament must be represented on the Europol Management Board and be able to have a say in the election of the Director of that institution.
The police are looking for an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because he was met by a car in his lane, the driver of a VW had to avoid Touran and touched while the guardrail.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was traveling with his VW at 19.55 clock on the B 215 from Stolzenau coming towards Leese.
In the area of the bypass of Stolzenau a car came to meet him in his lane, so he had to dodge to the right.
The Touran driver touched the guardrail.
Property damage occurred on the car.
The driver of the oncoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without worrying about the traffic accident.
It can be good, according to the accident victim, that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident.
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident and the driver of the polluter vehicle to contact the commissariat in Stolzenau at tel. 05761/92060.
Lack of storage and transport capacities as well as organizational difficulties mean that liquid manure must be "disposed of" on geographically favored agricultural areas.
These bookstores display the publications of EUR-OP in a shop window or a part of a shop window reserved for this purpose and must keep the most important publications of EUR-OP constantly in stock and they must be connected to an online ordering system for the procurement of non-stock items.
The decline in domestic consumption as a result of the economic crisis, falling income for the workforce due to unemployment and high inflation and the decline in exports of Greek wines have, after accession to the EEC, led to significant stockpiles, for example in Crete, Santorini and other areas.
In addition to the 1981 harvest are still 115 000 t of the 1980 crop in stock, which could not be discontinued.
Only one of the speakers spoke of the possibility that his own garden could become a storage place for radioactive waste.
We should be ashamed that we have huge amounts of milk and butter in stock, while in the Third World children are dying of hunger.
He may, of course, refuse them at the present time, but this would only mean a delay, because the day is certain when the Council will have to reduce the quotas and dissolve the camps.
However, the Honorable Member's observation that 50 000 tonnes of last year's harvest are in stock must be disputed.
If we go ahead with our set-aside program, we will soon have 18 million tonnes in stock.
The Commission claims that the stocks are too large, which is not true, since less than nine million tonnes of stock, not even 6% of annual production, is not exaggerated, but let's put that aside.
After intervention purchases, we have 200,000 t of butter in stock, apart from the East German stocks, and by the end of this year these stocks will grow to about 270,000 t.
The war will come to an end, and in the camp of the vanquished as in the camp of the victors one will take stock.
Somewhere there are 40,000 tons of salmon in stock, which will soon be thrown on the world market.
According to press reports, an old cargo ship is in service in the Saronic Gulf, which was converted eight years ago into a floating laboratory and a warehouse for the oil-bearing waste from passing ships.
Tenders must be sent to the intervention centers, which have good storage and resale opportunities.
And now we are told that the camps are too expensive.
Most of my group supports the rapporteur's amendment that military facilities or warehouses should fall within the scope of the directive.
The entire warehouse is divided into different rooms.
In principle, it should be possible for Germany, France or England to deposit their radioactive waste in a warehouse in Sweden.
The concentration of production capacity allows for maximum economies of scale and leads to the relocation of intermediate production, storage and transhipment sites, resulting in clustering effects in the production and distribution areas.
Up to the point of customization, the number of warehouses is minimized, reducing inventory risk, storage costs and throughput times.
Concrete applications include: Businesspeople who want to retrieve their fax and e-mail transmissions from out-of-town and non-specialized equipment, vendors who want to verify without a terminal, if a given product is on stock, and individuals who want to check their bank account by phone.
Development of intelligent storage and handling systems to optimize product quality.
New developments in the field of biotechnology enable new approaches to reduce quality losses and to develop environmentally friendly storage and handling systems.

This service handles removals, warehousing (including the Overijse warehouses) as well as insurance and inventory.
However, this could not be achieved because the negotiating conference was unable to resolve the disagreements on certain fundamental issues (in particular the question of the general size of the camps, their allocation to the Member States, the details of developing countries' participation in warehousing and the levels of prices which the camp intervenes to collect by levy or levy).
The Council has decided to increase the monthly increases for the 1981/82 marketing year by some 20% in order to take into account the evolution of storage and financing costs for cereal storage and the need to sell stocks of cereals in line with the needs of the market.
This increase, which applies to cereals, wheat and rye flour and wheat groats and fine rices, was granted within the objectives of the basic 'cereals' regulation, bearing in mind the storage and financing costs of grain storage in the Community and the need to sell cereal stocks in a manner which does not cause market disturbances.
Data processing, office equipment, procurement, general maintenance, equipment maintenance, vehicle fleet, drivers, warehouses and archives
The Council took that decision in the context of the purpose of the basic Regulation 'Cereals', in order to take account of the storage and financing costs of grain storage in the Community and to allow the disposal of cereal stocks which does not cause market disturbance.

While the staff working in the business premises needs less qualifications, those responsible for warehouse management and data technology need a much higher level of education and training.
Changes in inventories can be calculated either as the difference between the inventory at the end of the year and that at the beginning of the year, or the difference between the inventory additions and the inventory releases during the year.
Excluded are harbor vehicles, barges and tugs used in seaports, ferries, fishing vessels, dredgers, ships for hydraulic work and ships used exclusively as warehouses, floating workshops, houseboats and recreational purposes.
The rapid growth of final demand in some Member States over the quarter has led to a reduction of inventories in France (-1.2% of GDP) in the Netherlands (-1.0% of GDP), Denmark (-0.7% of GDP) and Sweden (-0.2% of GDP), with the latter three also moving in the opposite direction compared to the previous quarter.
Sales of olive oil held by the Italian intervention agency were carried out repeatedly, and by the end of 1978 some 95 000 tonnes were still in stock.

In particular, the Court wishes to know whether such a transaction exists when the contract of sale has been concluded between two companies established outside the customs territory of the Community but the purchaser, a subsidiary of the seller, has a branch established in that territory with the task of ordering the goods from the seller, managing the warehouses and distributing the goods to customers, in particular to distributors of the products sold under the parent's trade mark.

Therefore, a high elasticity compared to the share of capital inflows in assets may correspond to a low adjustment of the stock.
Apart from losses due to continued storage, processing and transport difficulties, supply will decline as farmers, who are clearly expecting a further price increase following the increase in government buying-in prices in May 1990, hoard the grain.
Obviously, some of the stock of intermediate and intermediate products, which were partially dismantled in the spring, will be filled up a bit.
The development prospects for production, in turn, remain positive even if they deteriorate by one point (+ 5 vs. + 6), thus returning to their July levels, which is undoubtedly related to the somewhat less favorable expectations regarding the size of inventories of unsold finished goods (+12 vs. +11) (Table 2).

The indicator is the means of replies (balances) to questions about production prospects, order books and warehouses (the latter after change of sign).
Mine dumping in the mines will be substantial in 1985 (notably in the United Kingdom), but will be offset almost entirely by an increase in stockpiles at UK power stations.
Thus at the end of August 1975 the Community of Nine held almost 1 million tonnes (1974 322 000 tonnes), even though production had fallen by 2.4% in 1974 compared to 1973 and the increase in the first few months of 1975 (January to April) was less spectacular at 6.2%.
In recent years, preservation, storage and transport technology for dairy products have been developed, spread and cheapened so far that the supraregional supply of all dairy products is practicable today.
The certainty requirement is satisfied if all goods stored in a certain room are transferred by way of security ("space contract") or if items to be transferred from the warehouse are individually marked ("marking contracts").
However, the market may also be supported by more elastic measures such as storage or distillation aid, take-back by producer groups and others.
Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the cases of abuse relieved Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger.
That's what author and historian Michael Hesemann means.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to cause discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reform movement "We are Church", said after publication to the German Press Agency, he expected from the former Regensburg bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the cathedral conductor Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of emeritus Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.
It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church greatly if Muller and Ratzinger expressed their profound regret over their own omissions or their misjudgments at the time.
The Vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano, on the other hand, criticized the fact that the coverage of Domspatzen violence was measured as "double standards".
Regarding the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that these are "shameful and shameful acts" that should be punished and prevented in the future, but the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, according to author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church the source of all evils is already part of everyday experience, and it is preparing public opinion to consider it normal," writes Scaraffia.
Even Princess Gloria von Thurn and Taxis said in an interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk: "You like to go to the church and that is a found eating".
She also pointed out that in her youth "beatings were a normal educational tool" to "cope with cheeky kids like me".
It would be unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades because the world has changed.
Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared in connection with the reports of the cases of abuse.
Completely wrongly, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the memorial volume "My brother the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is in the 440-page report submitted by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, commissioned by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment?
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of assaults, 67 Domspatzen.
The final report states Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can be said that in many cases Domkapellmeister R. used forms of physical and psychological violence.
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more intense.
Nevertheless, in contrast to many other accused, it is noticeable that many victims valued the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases despite violence even positive memories with him ".
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg cathedral sparrows Georg Ratzinger relieved in his opinion.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence at Schutzbefohlen in the Regensburg Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
First, many students emphasize his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who was often palpable when a Domspatz musically did not bring top performance.
How do you rate this final report as his biographer?
Michael Hesemann: If you go to the trouble and read the whole 440-page report from beginning to end, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger even occurs in it.
He has only eight pages devoted to him and is clearly absolved of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the horrific cases of sexual abuse.
The violent excesses at the preschool also took place outside his sphere of influence.
At best, one can reproach him for having learned too late or not taking his first hints seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, where he worked, was perceived by practically all respondents as - literally - "redemption", "heaven" and "better world".
Thus, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger a very excellent testimonial describes him as "warmhearted", "popular", "sincere", "competent" and "understanding", as extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and was "always surrounded by grapes of children".
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which sometimes led to rage.
That he not only slammed with chairs and threw the keychain on the floor, but also distributed slaps and too naughty guys pulled the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regrets and apologized for it.
To honor his salvation, however, it must be said that such parenting methods were widespread among parents and teachers at the time in question, the 1960s and 1970s.
Do you also know such chastisement methods?
Of course, I think each one of us who was born before 1968.
I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.
Compared with what this report is about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the preschool, these are trivialities.
One wonders whether it is not rather with his reputation and his role as brother of Benedict XVI has to do that many media rushed to him.
Many people who have never understood him are still working hard on the Bavarian Pope.
But the truth is: The report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
In the media in connection with the report a lot was reported on the topic of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
Will Georg Ratzinger be blamed for any involvement or connivance with sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Definitely no.
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted himself to the Domkapellmeister.
Not even the parents were initiated.
"I never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," said one person on behalf of the others, "I was very embarrassed."
The real problem in sex education education has been, and still is, that most victims are silent out of shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choirmaster, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.
How do the Domspatzen students rate Ratzinger's role with regard to cases of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: A questioned student put it this way: "Regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which of all he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and the respective perpetrators could have stopped.
I think it's really absurd to suppose that he, of all people ... opened more insistently or more clearly, or even more, than to their parents, boarding school teachers, trust teachers, etc.
That you talk to him about sex ... - unthinkable. "
Thus, the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that in the run-up affected students and / or their environment entrusted to him, could not be confirmed in the investigation."
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore exempt from all acquaintance.
So he can not be accused of not preventing him or to have brought to the announcement.
Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these disgusting crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
There was much to read in the media about "excesses of violence" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "looking away".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That's the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge mix of sexual abuse and excesses of violence and somewhere, right in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.
But that's another misuse of the report.
There is a clean separation: between the preschool and the gymnasium of Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violent excesses and, let's say, other allegations.
In addition, the report deals with events from the time since 1945, including four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choirmaster of Domspatzen.
The whole terrible spanking pedagogy, the cases in which boys were saddled and maltreated by sadistic teachers and suffered terribly, all occurred at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only got to see the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
On this, as most of the witnesses emphasize, the topic "preschool" was taboo.
One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacal" states.
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was already discipline, but not sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases despite violence even positive memories with him".
So at most there is still the charge to have looked away.
But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported on the conditions on the preschool.
The first time 1970/71, when he was just beginning to establish himself and wanted to hear nothing about what was happening at a school where he was not working and responsible (according to the witness), and then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut his ears to the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because as early as 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduced.
In it he points out that "in preschool the flogging continues to be practiced".
Even in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
That was, of course, at a time when there was legal clarity when flogging was banned in Bavaria.
Before that, they were in a legal gray area, as we all know.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the victims might have exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had actually been exceeded.
But you can not say he always looked away.
That's just not true.
Only in 1980, the flogging was officially abolished at schools in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria von Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians talk about the "pitfall of anachronism", ie the danger of valuing the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess is already right.
But of course that does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorrent at all times and also not for what was done in pre-school tribes and violence to innocent child souls, that goes far beyond the usual then.
This is all very terrible and I'm glad that it is finally worked up.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, slapping and pulling hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
As physical punishment was then banned, he has also strictly adhered to it.
Which picture of his time in Regensburg did Georg Ratzinger reproduce in his conversations with you for the book "My brother the Pope"?
Did the subject of flogging also come up?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, told from his perspective, as the Domspatzen played only a minor role.
Nevertheless, I do not conceal that he had a strict regiment there.
But even that must be said once: Without this perfectionism, without demanding unconditional discipline, he would hardly have been able to form from the previously nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen a world-class institution, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which went twice in the US (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991) on tour.
With biscuits and sweets alone, unruly youngsters can not make great singers, and every success, be it in any field, is always disciplined, passionate and self-defeating.
What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger talking about her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I've met Georg Ratzinger really well and over and over again as a wonderful, humorous, good-natured, deeply faithful and kind-hearted people, of which one can not imagine that he could do any harm to a fly.
I regularly get to know how many former Domspatzen, even today, 23 years after his retirement, keep in touch with him, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.
So those who do not forgive him until now, that he once was strict with them, are clearly in the minority.
Today, most of the Domspatzen are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music.
And that he is always a good, fatherly teacher - a stern father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable person of respect, to whom they look up today and whom they truly adore.
And, once again, very clearly: Everything you accuse him of are educational methods that were commonplace at the time.
We can be glad that we have long since overcome this time.
But it is highly unfair to make a man a media scapegoat simply because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother.
There's the evil intent behind it, all too obvious.
Because the report, which has just been published, relieves him.
Now the decency would command, a 93-year-old man who has earned great merit and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany probably nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally left in peace.
