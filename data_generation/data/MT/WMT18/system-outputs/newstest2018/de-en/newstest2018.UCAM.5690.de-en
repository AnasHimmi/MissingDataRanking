Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A false institution where young people are supposed to meet today.
A crypt chapel where the S-Bahn tunnel is now being dug.
Small gardeners manage the former land of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories.
It's annoying when maps aren't up to date.
Everyone knows this, who had to get upset because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a bypass.
The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlas, an offer of the Geoportal Bavaria of the state government, are far from current - but for this very reason very revealing.
Especially if you compare them with current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the distribution area of Munich's Mercury have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bavaria Atlas is a patchwork that is not immediately recognizable as such.
More detailed maps, so-called Urpositionsblätter (Urpositionsblätter), have been incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
According to the Bavarian Survey Administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a topographical recording of Bavaria - for military purposes, of course.
Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville of 9 February 1801, it was today's neighbours who created the idea of a comprehensive map of Bavaria.
Elector Max IV. Joseph drove the project further, founded the "Topographical Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian surveying administration.
The Urpositionsblatt for Munich dates from 1856 and, like all others, can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.
The comparison between the former and the present is most impressive in the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which still appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated as a district of Munich 21 years after the map was drawn up, i.e. in 1877.
Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was not named until 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a smaller map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: Handwritten numbered plots of land from the so-called "original recording," from which the property tax was derived.
Small plots no longer occupy farmers there today - but small gardeners of the "Land in Sun" plant.
A large green area is emerging north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, the site of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was actually still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives a glimpse into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt one reads not only the street name "am Gasteig" or "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt" in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen.
Yes, people with delusions were once locked up here on Auerfeldstraße.
In 1858 / 59 the Münchner Kreis-Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüften" was founded there.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chains of the so-called erroneous.
He has also banned staff from using violence against the inmates,"says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has been involved with the institution for an exhibition.
There was room for 280 patients at first, later expanded to 500 places.
At some point, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar in 1905.
The Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of the largest psychiatrists in Germany, has been located there since 2006.
On the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in the Salesianum in Munich.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities.
To the west lies the football pitch of the TSV Munich East, east residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural reference to the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed in bombings during the Second World War.
The Marienplatz was recorded as "Main Square" around 1856, the Kaufinger Street was called "Kaufinger Gasse."
The Second World War also brought about a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs tore many holes into the city centre in December 1944.
A large one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval crypt chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on April 5, 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn main line takes place.
With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.
He reports that those waiting in queues for the security check keep asking what the problem is and get the answer "There's no problem" from security officials.
By and large, it ran smoothly in most places, even if it was quite inefficient in the hospital - people were dusting themselves in a long queue. "
I left the polling station about 17:00 and the snake was about a kilometre long.
A snake outside a Takoyaki shop.
Ahmad Shuja uploaded a photo via Twitter showing people standing in a long queue to get their voting card.
At some polling stations in Malawi, the queues were so long that people could not see the polling station at the end of the queue.
"Today the snake is long," she notes as she walks.
Normally there is an extra queue for the students.
"And they've closed the queue for the students, but that's important," Vicki continues, ignoring Arlet in the process.
Civil rights group releases travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colors has issued a warning for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is scheduled to take effect by August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when traveling around the state and exercise extreme caution, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are noted here," the group's statement reads.
A recently passed Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement agencies disproportionately targeting minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
"They have civil rights violations that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten up or killed,"Missouri NAACP President Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints at such a frequency that we haven't heard before."
It is the first such warning the Organization has issued for a state in the US.
The group cited incidents such as racist offenses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier in the year after he ran out of gasoline while traveling across the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The council also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black motorists in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be ready, whether it's bringing bail money or letting the relatives know they're travelling around the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, which ranked the state 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU says will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, advocacy groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
In the northwestern border province there are approximately 13 branch centers, and in Beluchistan there are 30 other camps, which are smaller.
We must no longer look at the problem, from the point of view of participation or non-participation, and thus go to one of the two opposing camps.
At present, in southern Afghanistan, logistical camps, rolling transport and the expansion of world airports are creating the military conditions for taking control of Beluchistan and reaching the Indian Ocean.
The hospitals and police clinics, as well as the camps near the border, were looted.
There are United Nations camps guarded day and night.
The Israeli government assured the Presidency that security measures around Palestinian camps would be strengthened.
With the reopening of the camps, with the police combing through the residential areas of ordinary people and with mass arrests in the early hours of the morning, the regime wanted to respond brutally, in our view scandalously, to the ever-growing discontent and popular anger at the difficulties and economic failures of the regime.
This organisation has limited responsibility for helping refugees living outside the camps.
There are indeed countries in which there is a kind of revolt around the camps, because the local population has the impression that the refugees in the camps are better off than they themselves.
Their camps are being bombed.
They preserve as memorials and symbols the camps of torture and the workshops of death.

Mr President, I conclude with the simple statement that, although we are satisfied with the electoral process, we are not so satisfied with demobilisation, because the Honduran Government has prevented the international organisations mentioned in the Tela Convention from visiting the Contras camps recently.
This puts it in the camp of the brakes on European development, those who see strengthening the EC as a provocation towards Moscow and Eastern Europe, which is a very regrettable development.
We welcome everything the Commission has done, and I am sure that the Commissioner will insist on a thorough investigation of the camps during his visit to the camps.
Many perished in the resistance, others fled to camps in neighboring Papua New Guinea (PNG), but they can't feel safe there either.
I agree with the honourable Member on the importance of maintaining the concentration camps for future generations as a testimony to Nazi crimes against humanity, but I believe that the sites of several camps have already been placed under the permanent protection of the competent national and local authorities for the reason mentioned by the honourable Member.
I have visited a camp other than Mrs Ewing: A camp with 97 000 refugees on the border with Somalia, maintained by non-governmental organisations, the European Community and other donors.
Without mentioning names, I would like to say that the 'naysayers' have two camps.
However, it seems that several of these camps are under the constant protection of the competent national and / or local authorities.
I thought the old left and Rousseau's utopia had long since been buried, responsible for the millions of deaths of the gulag and the camps of Communist China.
Parts of the population are deported to camps in the Arab north, with the sole aim of depriving the people of the Nuba of their Christian faith and culture.
The Community and its Member States have also condemned the existence of detention centres, particularly in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and called for the camps to be opened immediately for international inspection and dissolved as quickly as possible.
This can also be blamed on the Lebanese Government, which, with its refusal to allow the deported Palestinians into the country, and also with its refusal to allow aid agencies access to the provisional camp, has no other objective than to exploit the matter for political purposes to the detriment of Israel.
For a few weeks, after the discovery of the camps, we have been discovering the rapes.
This attention and financial support must not be limited to the camps located in the territory of the Community, but must also apply, if not above all, to the camps located in the rest of Europe.

Grazing fence project is elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue next year.
CDU Bundestag members Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac took a picture on the ground.
Representatives of the Fischerbach CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies at the Schwendemann family's legal cemetery.
Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into his farm, in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplies 40 dairy cows and as many young animals, and houses holiday guests in five apartments.
The "Black Forest milk" is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, according to Schwendemann.
On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the grazing fence project as "elementary important."
I cannot make a profit on such steep areas.
The grassland area provides a lot of work, many things have to be processed with the motor sense.
"We are struggling here with the conditions and with the topography," Schwendemann stressed.
In 2003 he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not run a organic farm.
For mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The commune has recognized the importance of the grazing fence project and is pleased with the Leader funding."
At a cost of between EUR 3000 and EUR 4000 per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that the reforestation of the areas could be dragged out for quite a while.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and worrying about how to get their farm on," the mayor insisted.
Farmers often face criticism for the promotion
A total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 via the fence promotion.
The disclosure area is thus 40 hectares, which are not allowed to be reforested until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was funded through Leader, with a quarter carried by the municipality of Fischerbach.
This left farmers with €12,610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence.
"The big advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You are doing a really good job, without farmers and rural women it is not possible."
For Peter Weiß, too, it was clear: "Best food is produced here."
The Landscape Management Directive (LPR) of Baden-Württemberg enables the state to promote pasture fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
A prerequisite is the presence of a funding backdrop designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be traceable (inclination above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
The application of eight participants with 24 plots looking to build just under 16 kilometres of fence is currently under way for the Fischerbach Weidezaunprojekt 2018.
The disclosure area is 35 hectares and the calculated cost is more than EUR 112 000.

Now the Trump White House Takes the Statue of Liberty
The surest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as much as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated dispute with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration.
To remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had done it.
But he attacked their importance, and in particular the importance attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed.
When Miller lambasted Acosta: "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you're referring to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, it's not really about history.
It's about the contemporary resonance of the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / your beleaguered masses yearning to breathe freely, / the wretched waste of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "miserable waste" was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's US.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute: It is, in fact, a conflict over the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends, who campaigned to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were performing a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classic pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has been given a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of exiles.
The poem's connection with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this back for a long time.
The great scream Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone, but rather an early neoconservative bringing the American flame to the overnight world: "Lady Liberty is going ahead.
It is meant to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not meant to light the way into the United States. "
Quite unusually, Limbaugh has come across something here.
The importance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see it the way it was seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And that, of course, is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not meant to illuminate the way, but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of Great Britain team
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots were part of the Great Britain team
UK athletics performance director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Cup squad "will make a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which kicks off on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and UK athletics needs to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," Black said.
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they've done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the type on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant. "
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah at the 5,000m track, while Eilidh Doyle has been voted team captain by the team.
"Eilidh is quite humble.
Her captain's speech was unbelievable,"Black says.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh brought in quite naturally was great. "
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British squad.
Scotland's best total of athletes at the World Cup so far was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Middle-distance runner Muir leads the way, setting five British and two European records last year.
She will take part in the 1,500m and 5,000m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500m, is another Scot to watch after a great season that included winning the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a huge honour anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and elected me makes it something very special for me," she added.
"Obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots who are part of the team.
It just shows how far we have come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to step up to podiums.
As for my speech as captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home World Cup.
So it's really important to put on that home support and benefit from us being back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such a great atmosphere out there. "
Crucial to the website was our desire to create an audio platform that provides a space for emerging talent from the most diverse areas in the region.
Overall, the EP supported the proposals for harmonisation by a large majority, even though some of the victims of those involved and certain deviations from the usual policy in some Member States were called for, because it was clear that without harmonisation of cost factors and legislation, no great progress towards greater freedom of movement could be achieved.
The need, the benefits and the gradual implementation of such a project must be recognised and felt by all, so that the efforts and necessary sacrifices are made on a voluntary basis.
But how can we demand these sacrifices from our peoples, our constituents, when the same voters read daily in the newspaper about such human rights violations?
Nevertheless, I believe that farmers are prepared to make these short-term sacrifices so that, in the long term, the health of the people can be improved.
Mr Berkhouwer pointed out how bitter this is for the athletes who have made sacrifices for years, taken deprivation to attend this event.
The point here is not that we would refuse to make a sacrifice, but the temporal impossibility of returning to the constituency and coming back in time on Monday morning.
The prisoners of Tunis have not died for nothing if their victim triggers a justified indictment of the regime of Bourguiba, this sprout of the so-called free world, and if they are a confirmation of the need to resist human rights violations wherever they may occur.
They are certainly words she uttered with the feeling of a woman, a Democrat, an anti-fascist campaigner who knew the victim.
This is testified to by the commitment and sacrifices - including to people - to which some of the Nine have been and continue to be prepared for this country and its people by providing contingents of troops to the UN peacekeeping forces.
But conveying credible values also means convincing others that, if necessary, they are also prepared to make sacrifices for these values.
In view of this situation, it seems logical that, in return for the sacrifices demanded of milk producers on the fats of plant and maritime origin imported into the Community under preferential conditions, a co-responsibility levy should also be imposed.
This also explains the heroic sacrifice of Bobby Sands, O'Hara, Hughes, MacCreesh and, sadly, Joe MacDonnell, who died yesterday after a sixty-day hunger strike, who enjoy the approval and support of Irish Catholics and much of European and global public opinion.
This is meant by the word "victim."
Our notion demands some sacrifices on the part of the rich.
The Olympic fighters from many countries, who bravely made an enormous personal sacrifice, also believed that the Community would keep its promise.
The fact that we impose heavy sacrifices on ourselves is of no use if our competitors exploit them for their own growth.
And the success of the Camp David agreement just shows that, for the first time in history, the military victors have made material sacrifices to bring peace.
This action - it must be said - will demand great sacrifices from the population and the workers, victims who must appear to be hated if they do not clearly find their justification in the efficiency of the plants and a sufficient balance between surplus and deficit of production and consumption per capita of the individual Member States.
Thirdly, account must be taken of the great efforts and sacrifices made by Luxembourg since the beginning of the steel crisis, i.e. since 1975, for the restructuring of its steel industry.
Enlargement would pose a dramatic threat to the Spanish fishing industry and even this sacrifice could not prevent our production capacity from being substantially reduced.
Considerable concerns have been expressed about the fact that victims - because victims were ultimately required - should be brought evenly by farmers in all countries.
We say very firmly: We do not stand with our backs to the wall and do not need to impose new sacrifices on small and medium-sized farmers; it is also different.
The agriculture ministers were realistic and I know that all our farmers will be prepared to make some sacrifices in order to promote the long-term viability and stability of the common agricultural policy.
However, the victims must be distributed evenly among the Member States, and I strongly reject the idea that British farmers should be worse off than their European counterparts.
Bearing in mind that we must all participate in the happy and unpleasant events of the Community in the same way, and that it now requires sacrifices if the economy is to be relaunched, we accept the price increases proposed in the Woltjer report.
The members of the EPP even go so far as to call for a fair distribution of the victims in the resolution they have signed with others.
We must also remember that, if the democratic parties of Europe had been vigilant and determined, this sacrifice of so many might not have been necessary.
However, these efforts must continue for some time, otherwise all the sacrifices that have been made so far, particularly in terms of jobs, would have been pointless.
A civilised state must avoid the sacrifice of the uninvolved.
The economic losses, the number of human victims in the fight against fires, the costs are so high that they can no longer be borne by individuals, by the Autonomous Communities, by the municipal and municipal administrations and thus lead to serious economic shocks.
Of course, several important parts of the programme fell victim to the above-mentioned reduction, including, in particular, aeronautical research.
It would therefore be unfair to commemorate only one part of the victims and to leave the other part unmentioned.
Now everyone who has a little common sense knows that you must be able to make compromises and make sacrifices if you live together in twelve.
Through this sacrifice, they managed effectively to shake up the international conscience and trigger a wave of solidarity with the Afghan people, which is now culminating in this victory.
But in the name of what goal are we being asked to make all these great efforts, all these upheavals, all these sacrifices?
In line with these efforts, producers outside the Community should make similar sacrifices if we are to achieve a more stable balance on world markets.
The Polish people, who have been suffering for years from the lack and scarcity of basic products, have just embarked on an ambitious recovery process and economic reforms that will demand further efforts and sacrifices from this courageous and patient people.
The families of the Sellafield workers are now being asked to make an extreme sacrifice.
Only then will all the soldiers of Europe, whose blood as an invisible ornament for the victims of the past has wetted the doorstep of every house in this area and soaked every plot in fields, meadows and gardens, only then will all these soldiers who have fallen in battle be able to rest in peace!
On the contrary, they would increase social and national sacrifices, especially for the weakest nations.
They have worked generation after generation and made heavy sacrifices.
I will be told that every country must make sacrifices in order to build a well-organised, integrated and efficient community, both small and large.
Pakistan is a country that has already made great sacrifices in the Afghanistan war with the reception of millions of refugees.
Beyond this very general planning, we should not forget that there are special cases, such as the case of Poland, which as a whole has become the object of demonstration of what our world policy will look like and what our real intentions are, because the Poles were the first to initiate this democratisation process and have been prepared to make sacrifices for it.
Parliament should approve measures that reconcile the United States but make a great sacrifice to European farmers.
The sinking of fishing boats by submarines can be avoided, and I urge the Commission and the governments of the Member States to agree immediately on appropriate procedures to ensure that the Antares crew was the last victim our fishermen made to the Cold War.
We knew that war was the victim in politics.
I believe that the Council must ensure that something is done for the minorities that remain, including in a smaller Yugoslavia; in particular, the victims in Bosnia-Herzegovina also need attention.
The one-net rule proposed will impose different hardships and sacrifices on fishermen in different regions and waters that will not be fair by the bank.
While this is a unique achievement in the history of international maritime shipping (thanks to the self-sacrifice of the crew and the flawless coordination of rescue operations by the captain in extraordinarily difficult weather conditions, there was not a single victim), the deliberate defamation was guided by low motives of unfair competition.
We will all have to make sacrifices in our way of life, in production and in consumption.
Secondly, we need to strengthen the principle of safety and environmental protection, to raise standards and European and international controls throughout the cycle, from shipbuilding to ports and shipping; this is essential in order to halt the negative spiral which has led to more and more serious accidents in recent years, and to prevent wild competition, which is increasingly a victim of quality and safety.
Therefore, both the authorities and the Moroccan public have used their connection with the Community as an essential element in their internal political discussion, precisely because they have had the opportunity to "sell" to their own people, so to speak, that it is necessary for a more stable and better future to take on these victims.
I wish governments would take an example of such people who show more commitment and make greater sacrifices in the face of such a human tragedy.
But the question is whether we have the means to achieve our objectives and whether we have the courage to explain to our respective populations what sacrifices they must make so that we can use sufficient resources to achieve our objectives.
Of course, the necessary restructuring cannot be guided by selfishness, but by a clear position from the Commission, so that the victims of the social partners and the investment efforts of the last few decades will not have been in vain.
In my country, beef is the most important agricultural export - no other product has this importance - and because we export 80% of our total beef production, the whole GATT issue carries enormous weight for us, and it is quite certain that we will have to pay for it beyond the sacrifices that have already been made in the CAP.
The reorganisation of the market and the balance between supply and demand are to be found in the restriction of production, even if this solution is difficult given the sacrifices involved.

Blocking critics via Facebook: Don't run for public office if you can't tolerate voter heating
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to beat him because of everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
He chimed at the criticism, sure.
But he has not silenced his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said,"freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, we are led to slaughter like the sheep."
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's staff have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have voiced their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Na, and?."
"It's just Facebook," a lot of people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state that is astonishingly popular.
He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary heathead.
He has shown a firm hand in running his state and strict adherence to principles.
He was also very adept at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents and playfully debuting his hairless head after chemotherapy on his page.
So blocking people coming to the governor's side - which is a public forum called official and by staff paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people swinging the whip online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people talking to their elected leaders: A teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the comments section of the news outlet "The Post."
"I also don't appreciate this idea, if a number of people take a stand on the same issue, then they are more likely to be disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort and not recognised as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor's aides described as a "concentrated spam attack," others would likely call "advocacy."
The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in previous times, if the same had been done, that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or to arrest and silence protesters.
But that is exactly what is happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for bashing Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on the issue fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable Porto had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers chimed in on his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers slamming Washington's decisions.
Petitions that criticized his position on Amity's contract, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project's online papers.
But he has not silenced them.
Freedom of speech, difference of opinion and discourse are part of the foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
A week after a preliminary settlement was made public, the two banks said that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common shares at the uniform price of $25.25, making a total of $3 billion.
The assumed price is below 19% of the share price of 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will secure it a 10% profit and can be sold again at a price of $31.25.
The last few weeks have been tough for the group, which has seen its stock market price fall by half, while the price of insurance against default has skyrocketed.
That price declined on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
On the 17th, two dead women shrouded in blankets were discovered in the Zoquiapan settlement of Ixtapaluca municipality and the next morning, in Huixquilucan, the corpse of a man wrapped in a yellow-blue blanket was found, probably named Mario Ríos, according to the news his killers left next to him.
Given the dense smog that burns in the throat and settles like a blanket over China's larger cities on a few days, improving air quality in China is one of the most pressing issues in terms of environmental protection.

Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at Renaissance Club
Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comforts over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
Northern, who led next door at Archerfield Links to the final round last year before losing to Paul Eales, is linked to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen the Renaissance club built, and we see it reaching its fame with this event," Rafferty said.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he's in a great state.
Jerry did a great job when he set this place.
He is a keen supporter of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, despite winning in both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"That feels really special," said the Southport-based player.
"I haven't been able to defend the Extremadura Open as it was taken out of the programme the year after I won it.

Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year, returns to action on home soil.

"You want to do well, but you also feel that extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played some solid golf.
I'm happy with how it went so far. "
With the trio on the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, while the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes, too.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, hinting at her vibrant, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and bright skirt.
"We used to have only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's gold country.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoRan of Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province the size of New Jersey with 153,000 residents.
In 2015 alone, Freeport shed $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has timber resources worth an estimated $US78 billion.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papua, who ensure Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 investigation in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970s became genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
"We will lose everything," says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which includes reports of atrocities the previous year, such as unlawful executions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular, according to another report - and the brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas HarAmend, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have intensified as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but the demographic is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are struggling to keep up here.
"The migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai local who moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura for work.
"It's cost the native Papua - the mom mom [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised during his 2014 election campaign to address the inequalities and rights violations in Papua.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's total 29 districts - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," You says.
In fact, Paniai suffered a nadir just two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The terrified children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offense at her tone and later came back with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers, who had been drinking, chased and beat the group with their rifle butts, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered on a football pitch outside the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - running in circles and mimicking a bird song - by Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began hurling stones at police and military posts.
As the mood heated up, the soldiers were sent a command on an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," an official document seen by TIME, which has not been released to local media, says.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the looming danger and called for calm and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, a lot of shots were fired," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was," Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, bears only one name, told TIME in a sombre mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" her station because she was being attacked.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua police spokesman Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
Five young protesters were killed and many more injured, according to Human Rights Watch.
News of the killings only came 'filtered' to Jakarta the following day.
For three weeks, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura expressing sympathies for the families of the victims and vowing to address the historic grievances in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately, so it won't happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an out-of-court mechanism to resolve historic human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these breaches, but there are processes that need to go through,"he said.
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5 and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead,"everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, whom the UN has charged with "crimes against humanity" that claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims took such claims with grim incredulity.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress whatsoever," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm scared to be arrested by the military, scared to be shot."
His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military searched for me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's Deiyai neighborhood.
One person died and 17 others were injured, including children, during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to take an unconscious man to hospital.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.
Excited villagers protested outside the company's location office.
Police said the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one.
"We were so panicked, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured being quickly hospitalized here, according to TIME.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for the police's mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a source of unrest for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of tribesmen Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the leafy highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua by inciting sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily taken into custody in Paniai in recent years, on the pretext of "securing national sovereignty."
Some never show up again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty strengthens discontent.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat: Especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women, who can each process four or five fields of sweet potato.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold in the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost just 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between native Papua and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new air routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs there are in the region usually go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting by international media remain tense.
Earlier in the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, despite being given rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi's campaign to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's restive easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: Visa denial and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
Lack of press scrutiny means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to Papua's immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta: "There is still a democratic system in place in Indonesia and there is free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
Local people want more foreign governments to take note.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and beleaguered him "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, the Paniai people are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua people, see their vote for Jokowi as a "debt" that he must repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai gunshot victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: The body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and military station.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they don't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with his head lowered.
"What else can we do?"
Fire captures Dubai's' Torch 'skyscraper for second time
A fire found its perimeter in one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-metre, 79-storey building.
It is the second fire to sweep through the high-rise building in just two years, which happens to be called the Torch Tower (torch tower).
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and people shouting.
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor,"one resident, who gave his name as George, told Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said fire fighting units extinguished the fire about 4 a.m. local time (00am GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working to provide shelter for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage came from the cladding, the exterior cladding for decoration or insulation.
In Britain, police said they believe the system of plates for insulation and cladding at London's Grenfell Tower in June may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died.

No Davis Cup reform: Continue best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has fallen through with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup singles on just two sets of wins was thinly unsupported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-set classics, which are often very long, but also highly valued for this reason, are thus retained in the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of member countries voted for the reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was narrowly missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire Davis Cup and Fed Cup reform package.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions,"Haggerty said.
We will continue to work to improve the applications.

About Graham Greene: "Our husband was so captivated by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh the emotions of adultery united with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted of coming to heaven on the detour of perdition."
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the assassination, several thousand dollars had been sent from Catalonia via a money transfer company "invested" in buying prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "command" that put an end to the lives of 106 people.
As is well known, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls for the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead their group, the two players will meet the prescribed sanction at the next league game against the Auxerre and so enter the next phase of the game without cards.
The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more common to be found in the world of football.
The advantage, obviously, is that the players start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 was supposed to end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phones), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment is the contactless technology, which enables payments in public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Its market share should increase further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent more than 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
"Jane, your little feet are naked; lie down to me in bed and cover yourself with my blanket."
On the other side of the square were tent stalls, where cotton goods, blankets and stockings were haggled, alongside horse harnesses and piles of colorful ribbons, the ends of which fluttered in the wind.
He asked K. to give him a blanket from the canapee.

Throwing off the ceiling was quite simple; he just needed to blow himself up a little bit and it fell by itself.
But then the lord and wife Samsa, each on his side, rushed out of the bed, Mr. Samsa threw the blanket over his shoulders, Mrs. Samsa came out only in the night shirt; so they entered Gregor's room.
In a small, dirty room, whose painted wall panel was badly spun and through whose thin wall you could hear a conversation next door, in an air filled with the suffocating smell of unclean things, a body wrapped in a blanket lay on a bed ripped off the wall.
The one arm of this body was above the ceiling, and the enormously large hand, similar to a rake, was incomprehensibly attached to a thin, long stick, equally strong from the beginning to the middle.
It was not in his mind to establish all the details in the condition of the patient, to think about how this body lay there under the ceiling, in which curved posture these ruined lower legs and hips and this lean back were stored and whether it was not somehow possible to store them better, to do something so that the sick person, even if it would not actually be better for him, would not have it quite so bad.
The wheelbarrow was brought in, the body laid on it, wrapped with a blanket and tied with knitting.
More than 1 in 5 US travellers bring banned items to plane, survey finds
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously smuggled prohibited items past U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who boarded the plane while accidentally carrying prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 per cent claimed they had belatedly discovered they had mistakenly travelled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers were more likely to flout the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared with less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items deliberately hauled past TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 per cent admitted knowingly carrying items with blades through security control, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately put banned drugs on the plane.
The company said it had interviewed travellers across the country to find out how many had accidentally brought contraband through airport security and how many had done it deliberately.
It's no surprise that the people most likely to carry contraband - knowingly or unwittingly - through security were the ones who fly the most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure what liquids they are allowed to take with them or how much of it.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of items seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a time, people thought the TSA could view books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Elektro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk likes to indicate with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3."

Musk had frequently advertised in recent months with the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: Of the total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics had repeatedly pointed out that these were merely non-binding reservations.
If cancelled, Tesla will pay back the €1000 (US $1000 in the US and £1000 in the UK) "reservation deposit" in full.
Currently, 455,000 such non-binding reservations would be available, Musk acknowledged in a conference call with analysts.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that cancelling around twelve per cent of all orders so far could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not on demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018 - all models taken together - it is projected to be 500,000, in 2020 a million.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, 1800 reservations are currently added per day.
Anyone ordering a "Model 3" today won't be allowed to expect delivery until the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new, never-before-tested production lines with maximum utilization without major interruptions.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
But if there are major delays, then the non-binding nature of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company can't stop dissatisfied customers from running away in droves.
EPA chief Pruitt withdraws over delaying Obama-era rules to reduce emissions
A day after he was sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, took back his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency proved more responsive to the needs of state environmental agencies than previous administrations.
He did not mention the lawsuit that had been brought against his previous post in a federal appeals court.
It is about a deadline that expired on October 1 for states to meet 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he will delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth."
Pruitt, who was an Oklahoma prosecutor before his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of tougher environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and fossil fuel industry oppose.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator overstepped his authority as he sought to delay the implementation of an Obama administration rule that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In an opinion piece released Wednesday night, Pruitt suggested that his U-turn on ozone standards quite simply reinforces the EPA's willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of meeting the new standards on time.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation," said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We don't believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously. "
Still, the EPA's opinion said Pruitt will eventually use his "power to delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the regulations are "based on sound policy and the best information available."
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader rewrite of ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is expected to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had sued the EPA this week, said the group planned to maintain legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal - according to our lawsuits - is an important win for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog pouring into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia in the case.
Soil ozone is created when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered on Pruitt's surprise change of tack.
"It's disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable move from the person responsible for protecting the air we inhale," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the Trump administration's ideological crusade to align ourselves with polluters and their special interests."
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by an ailing movement to extract concessions and financial perks from the government.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines looking to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.

Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, a serenade is invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30pm.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth charity serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the site have made Tumlingen's friends and patrons their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique village gem."
In 1267 the St. Hilarius Chapel was mentioned for the first time in the Württemberg document book: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen with the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.
According to the wording of the document, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a stately court on Tumlinger Berg, to which the church or the patronage law belonged and not vice versa.
So there were also people living there.
As the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt from 1858 shows, beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "mountain" was the third, the stately settlement core of the village.
Old maps from around 1600 underpin these historical facts.
The patronage law arose from the early medieval own church law.
A lord who built, equipped and occupied a church with a parish priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this own church.
Associated with this was the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two crumbled on Christmas 1673.
The newly purchased bell first sounded in 1692, but had to be delivered later in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the window panes were smashed in and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops encamped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remnants of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilarius church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was canceled.
Only the still existing tower dwarf remained as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Schaffigen pensioners" as successor of Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius plant.
On Sunday, July 16, the friends and supporters of Tumlingen invite you to the sixth serenade in the old cemetery to the St. Hilarius Chapel.
It is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 4:30 p.m.
Admission is from 3.30pm.
At the end of the serenade, a drink takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows towards the forest," the organisers highlight the fantastic view.
The serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
Friends and supporters of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini affirms.
Association wants approval of wind turbines tested
"Boisheim defends itself" sees no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore appealed to the county council.
The association "Boisheim wehr sich" (Boisheim defends itself) has asked Councillor Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 no wind turbines could have been approved at all in the Boisheimer Nette, as at the time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the city border with Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone excludes the use of wind energy for the rest of the city.
Such zones are intended to prevent the landscape from being "spared."
A few days earlier, the city of Viersen had decided on a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette by changing the land use plan - but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a form error.
"Due to the lack of a planning requirement, the approval decision issued is still unlawful and therefore also to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim is resisting."
Current state of affairs: The city council again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer recess; a permit from the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "At this point, the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded under planning law."
The circle confirms the receipt of the call.
"The corresponding letters have been received with Viersen County since last week," a spokesman explained.
The circle takes them as an opportunity to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not expected to cause the proceedings to be stopped.
With regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the district on Thursday did not want to comment on the substance of the association's argument "Boisheim defends itself."
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans to build four wind turbines, each 200 metres high, on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had entered into lease agreements with the owner of the roughly 65-acre site.
The four wind turbines are designed to meet the electricity needs of around 11,400 households - equivalent to around a fifth of the electricity needs of all four households.
NEW Re intends to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen's city council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen, as well as a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg County.
"It belongs to us, it's our future,' he added, after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
Thus, the emphasis on the civil character and the form of association do not merely serve to circumvent legal hurdles that might arise in the course of registration with the court - it is also a political strategy.

City and traders plan 'home shopping' weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are expected to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to entice residents to go shopping in the city centre.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home-shopping" weekend is intended to sensitize customers to what offers their own city offers away from the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional suppliers is therefore planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, domestic companies are to present themselves with their apprenticeships.
In addition, downtown shops are expected to invite "midnight shopping."
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the surrounding region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend, according to Christian König.
The city administration and the trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
This is another stage of the project "Attractive downtown."
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" at the Fountain Festival, including Sunday open for sale, talks with all traders and hosts to encourage them to actively participate.
Attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking charges on that day are also part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential is to be redeveloped or re-developed.
These include spa guests and tourists.
But many locals would also have lost sight of downtown when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to help revitalize downtown - right down to landlords, businesses across the city and clubs.
It was necessary to overcome the lethargy with a network that had partly spread, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian cities are participating for the first time in the third "home-shopping" day nationwide.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities," according to Streich.
The action led by the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his purchasing behaviour can influence his or her own direct environment.

The report concludes: "To meet global demand, private sector investment volume must increase by a factor of 20 to 30 to between $200 billion and $300 billion a year, on the assumption that government and philanthropic funds will double."
The essence of "This time is all different" syndrome lies in the assumption that crises only affect others.
Behind this is the assumption that behind the longest chain is a majority of users.
Our estimates are based on the assumption that profit growth is in line with consensus expectations.
Under the optimistic assumption that government spending and philanthropy will double in the medium term, private sector investment must increase by a factor of 20- 30 in order to meet the required financial needs.
Assuming that the added value of the suppliers falls in Switzerland, the purchases of the big banks generate an added value of approximately 2.4 billion Swiss francs and 19 275 jobs.
That the relatively inexpensive pillow has a future is a real assumption:

Assuming that the CHF will still depreciate slightly from the current level, we are lowering our forecast for GDP growth in Switzerland for 2015 from 1.6 percent to 0.8 percent.

Trump pressured Mexico over border wall payment after leaked transcripts of phone calls
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by The Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US president lambasted him for publicly denouncing the wall, reportedly saying to him: "You can't say that to the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern border of the US, vowing to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released, revealing a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the U.S. to take on refugees who emigrated to Australia was "ridiculous," "mies" and "stupid," and that insisting on the trade brokered by the Obama administration would make him look like a "Depp" after he proposed a ban on resettling refugees to the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended the call after telling Mr. Turnbull,"This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
I was led to a tavern, where the Conductor asked me to sit down to dine; however, as I had no appetite, he left me alone in a large room, at the two ends of which there was each a fireplace; a chandelier hung down from the ceiling, and at the top of the wall was a small, red gallery, on which various musical instruments lay.
And all this you see with the appearance of an oil lamp hanging from the ceiling, and that of a bright fireplace next to which I sit in a coat and hat; my muff and umbrella are on the table, and I try to recover from the heat of the furnace from the stiffness and anesthesia that a sixteen-hour journey in cold October weather had caused me; at four o'clock in the morning I had left Lowton and the city clock of Millcote was now just hitting the eighth hour.
After walking along the long, carpet-covered gallery, I climbed down the shiny bare oak staircase; then I came into the hall; here I stood still for a minute; I looked at some copper engravings on the walls, - still today I remember the same, one depicting a sinister looking man in a kiss; the other a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace - a bronze lamp that hung down from the ceiling, a large, old wall clock whose case had been strangely carved out of oak wood, and by the time had become black and blank like ebony.
She climbed down from her chair and came to me to sit down on my lap; then she seriously folded her little hands, threw her curls back, stitched her eyes on the ceiling of the room and began to sing a tune from some opera.
It was a large, stately compartment, with purple furniture and curtains, a Turkish carpet, walnut-clad walls, a large stained window and a richly carved ceiling.
I still see her in her raging passion when we had driven her to the extreme - she spilled our tea, crumbled our butter bread, threw our books up to the ceiling and made a colorful mess with the ruler and the desk, the fireplace itter and the fire pliers.
Right, and faster than she expected: Before she had half drunk the bottle, she felt her head bumping against the ceiling, and had to bend quickly so as not to break her neck.
Through the cracks of the wood, the sun's rays stacked on the tiles with long thin needles, or they broke in two at the edges of the furniture and swirled up to the ceiling.
"If you knew," she continued, beating up her beautiful eyes, from which tears rolled, to the ceiling,"what I've dreamed of all of!"
The interior of the hut was as rotten as the old; its walls were whitewashed, the beams of the ceiling blackened, the chimney collapsed, spinoffs hung on all corners; in the middle stood a row of wobbly tables and broken stems, in the ashes sat a dirty child, and in the background one saw a staircase, or rather a wooden ladder, leading up to a trap door in the ceiling.
In this passionate declaration of love, the gypsy sent up a glimpse of heavenly happiness to the dirty blanket that represented heaven here.
The young girl shook, raised her eyes to the ceiling, sunk backwards and trembling on the whole body, under his kiss.
On a sign of Charmolue's, she was put back on the bed, and two raw fists attached to her tender body the strap that hung down from the ceiling.
A crowd of different people - no one cared about the one entering - filled a medium-sized, two-story room, which was just around the ceiling surrounded by a gallery, which was also fully occupied and where people could only stand bent and hit the ceiling with their head and back.
But not she was screaming, but the man, he had pulled his mouth wide and looked to the ceiling.
Although there was no immediate light access, it was not completely dark, because some departments had bare wooden grids against the aisle instead of uniform board walls, but reaching up to the ceiling, through which some light penetrated and through which one could also see individual officials writing at tables or standing almost at the grid and through the gaps the people on the aisle observed.
Especially on the ceiling he liked to hang; it was very different from lying on the floor; one breathed more freely; a light swinging went through the body; and in the almost happy dispersion in which Gregor was up there, it could happen that, to his own surprise, he let loose and clapped on the floor.
"Under the ceiling and against the wall it's going to go."

Moore's Ford massacre: Activists reignite racist lynching act as call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled toward the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, was able to reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped out to block its path.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit - took a long train at his cigar and glanced through the windscreen checking.
Indoors, the inmates hovered in fear.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" The man roared.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams tore the silence as a young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat.
Luckily, this horrific scene, played on July 22, is just a re-enactment.
But then when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger," almost everyone in the audience blew out very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have been coming back to Moore's Ford Bridge to mimic the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It's really unfathomable that in all these years, not a single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reshuffle.
"It's a stain of dirt on a story, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and a lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the rematch serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want law enforcement, we want the termination, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need to get justice," he said.
"We can't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A forensic medic lays a bed cloth over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
More than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process, according to FBI files obtained by NBC News.
But none has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say the dual motivation for the Lynch actions has always been known across the city: Politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision allowed black citizens in Georgia to cast their ballots for the first time in the summer primary campaign.
Around the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farm keeper Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the city had been that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was escorted to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But then, as they moved away from the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the killings," concludes an FBI report.
"It's also obvious that there was a plot between state and local law enforcement that was not only involved in the killings, removed evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses."
Brooks puts it even more succinctly.
"It was a suffrage massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community:" If you register and if you vote, that's what's going to happen to you here."
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has presided over the annual re-enactment of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their portrayal is vivid, poignant and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and even harder to look the other way, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynching, because we are then confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or you don't want to hear what I've been through."
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest black - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched a well-rehearsed overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director here.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never get any easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Marbaugh said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to go back to these times."
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcom shouting at Hester and berating him, angry that he has slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- er, disappear from my property!"
Rascona reciprocates the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) erupts into laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!" Rascona asked.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too tough?
"No," Greene said, still giggling.
"I just don't think white people said' n --- er 'at the time."
"Yet," quipped one of the other black performers.
"You've just got to hit the hard' R. '."
And that's exactly where the energy in the room shifts, a sense of comradeship replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a mourning dress, stands over the corpses of the actors and performs Billie Holidays mourning "Strange Fruit" eulogy.
Her voice breaks at every second word.
About a hundred yards behind, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple have arrived from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just coming down the street.
They have all experienced Georgia's oppressive moisture for nearly eight hours when Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the burial sites of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
To this point, the killings have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the Lynch killings took place, the air feels spooky.
When the final notes of the song end, Greene invites the crowd to get closer and inspect the corpses.
Children squat at their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy mumbles as if he wants to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his fellow players and then collapses crying in their arms, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaking through at him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know that's not in your heart.
You've done that for a reason. "
Later, the audience sits down with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta chat excitedly about the rematch with a black couple they've just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words about what feeling the performance left behind.
"It's hard to hear these horrible words and actions... coming from people who look like you yourself and who do that because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does with me makes me believe that the lynching is still going on," she added,"today that's just called the police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, he eats and recalls civil rights.
He said he had already started planning the performance next year.
"The imitation is inspiring in a way, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's like, if we don't learn anything from it, then it can happen again.
Anyone who doesn't study their own history, anyone who doesn't know their own history, is doomed to repeat it. "
"Götterdämmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf relies on a colorful frivolous staging in front of a gigantic, six-storey backdrop.
The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows either a shabby street corner with wall rest and Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes vintage car, in which the Rhine daughters pose as rocker girls, or alternatively an Isetta, parks.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - which runs through his "ring" staging.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize beautifully as they did in the "Rheingold."
Kess seduce her Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), dragging a corpse into the trunk in Hollywood fashion and giving the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the gloriously nasty Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene as he slams Siegfried.
Later Gunther (Markus Eiche) has to believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who humbly bows his hands to the Merkel rod, are celebrated stormy.
There is huge applause for the festival orchestra showing up on stage for the first time - given the big heat again in empty casual attire.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his directing team had been eagerly awaited.
If he still had to endure a glowing pipe concert in 2013, there were big cheers five years later, in which the isolated "Buh" calls went down.
Festival boss Katharina Wagner is likely to have been delighted.
"You realize that the audience has grown together with the" ring "in a way," she had said shortly before the dpa's performance.
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but also developed an understanding of his point of view.
I draw a positive conclusion.
Almost everyone -- except companies like ExxonMobil or U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney and their purchased henchmen and misled acolytes -- understands that carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere when people burn hydrocarbons, and that the CO2 there acts like a huge blanket that absorbs the infrared radiation coming from below and warms the Earth.
Sufficient brightness, good contrast, freedom from flickering and reflection of the screen surface as well as high resolution and correct dimensioning of the characters are important for the readability of the display.
The finer the resolution of the screen, that is, the more "image points" per character are available, the better the readability of the information.
Graphic screens usually have a higher resolution than screens, which are only intended for displaying letters and digits.
In practice, you can determine the effect of resolution and display quality by checking whether certain critical characters can be easily confused or not; pairs are easily mistakable characters:
In its motion for a resolution, our group calls for the release of Souha Bechara and the other political prisoners and the dissolution of the Khiam camp.
Studies on the influence of topographic databases on the performance of external / internal propagation models in terms of data type, format (grid, vector) and resolution (area element and height);
Guidelines for quality control / quality assurance, such as camera quality, spatial and temporal resolution, etc., can be proposed if they prove helpful for this action.
Required configuration: PC with Pentium 100 Mhz (minimum) - 16 MB RAM (minimum) - CDROMReader with quadruple speed (minimum) - 15 MB free disk space - Superscreen VGA 256 color (resolution 640 Ω 480) Windows 95.
Other databases with a higher resolution can be used within the case studies.
Among the international projects at regional and continental level, the CORINE and CORINE Phare projects at the EEA, which generate soil cover information for Europe using TM images that achieve high resolution and accuracy, are particularly noteworthy.
They do not contain full resolution remote sensing images at this stage, although some samples of lower quality are available.
The five basic properties that describe the soil cover (wood-like, grass-like, bald soil, artificial (buildings), waters) can easily be determined with Earth observation data (both low and high resolution) over large areas for mapping purposes.
This option has allowed the creation of a high quality map base, with an expected geometric accuracy of 2.5 m (RMS) and a resolution of 1m.
In this case, with a geometric resolution of 1m, each point can be clearly localized, with the exception of objects whose resolution would be less than 1 meter.
The above-mentioned rule of thumb must be revised if the geometric resolution of the image is low, that is, if a considerable proportion of the objects whose area one would like to estimate is sunk by the presence of mixed pixels.
On the other hand, in the field of agrometeorological models and methods of vegetation monitoring with medium resolution satellites, a great deal of development and research work needs to be done.
Currently, GEOSTAT's geographic information system contains not only grid and point data with a resolution of 1 ha but also various vector files. In addition to project organization and management, the GEOSTAT project comprises two project units: The Service Centre and the IT Group.
Integration, management and maintenance of various geocoded, spatially relevant data available in the Swiss Federal Administration; this data should cover the entire country and have a spatial resolution of 100 m, which corresponds to a map scale of 1:25 000;
Data on the spatial development of a smaller number of land use categories (possibly 20 or less) with a lower spatial resolution and accuracy could be published 1 or 2 times a year to fill the data gap created by the fact that the area statistics can only be produced every 12 years on the basis of aerial images.
The remote sensing provides the data according to geometric meshes of different sizes depending on the resolution of the sensor (pixels).
In addition to the characteristic program, the scale and the geometric resolution (smallest different spatial unit), the nomenclature and the periodicity of the survey play a decisive role.
With regard to the selection of sample fields, however, in the first year of investigation in 1990 it was shown that very small fields with the relatively low geometric resolution of the currently available image material (LANDSAT TM: 30 Ω 30 m) could hardly be made visible in the satellite image.
Six of the seven spectral channels of the LANDSAT images from July 1990 and April and July 1991 were initially used for the calculations; the thermal channel was excluded because it caused too many mixing pixels at the plot boundaries due to its low resolution (120 to 120 m2).
However, the intended improvement of the spectral resolution in LANDSAT 6 will in any case have a positive effect on the usability of smaller training fields.
Satellite images with higher resolution (SPOT, LANDSATTM 6 with 15 to 15 m2) should therefore be available as soon as possible; at the same time, it would be necessary to examine whether sufficiently high levels of determination and satisfactory confidence intervals of the yield estimate can be achieved by including additional statistical and / or meteorological parameters in the correlation calculations.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, with the support of the ITA Consortium, began in 1987, using satellite data with high geometric and spectral resolution, to carry out estimates of cultivated land and crop yields, supplemented by sampling data from land use surveys on 4 500 surface segments of 50 and 100 hectares.
A first attempt to combine this survey with satellite data took place in 1981 with a picture of LANDSAT MSS, but did not produce convincing results, which was attributed to the insufficient resolution of the MSS sensor.
It has also emerged that it is possible to use ground data collected by points as well as segments for regression estimation, provided that a satellite with sufficient resolution is available, whereby SPOT appears to be more suitable for this application than LANDSAT TM.
A finer spatial resolution is necessary in order to be able to investigate effects on the environment.
Different applications in different geographical areas require different resolution and accuracy in the estimation of geophysical parameters.
For example, geostationary satellites can capture an area of a fifth of the Earth's surface in thirty minutes, delivering images with a resolution of 5 or 2.5 km.
Some of the problems encountered in the project are mentioned, including the difficulty of obtaining consistent multi-temporal data, the problem of developing a consistent and generally accepted classification, and the limitations of the scale and resolution of other data sets with which land use data must be combined.
PC with Pentium 100 MHz (minimum) - 16 MB RAM (minimum) - CD-ROM drive with quadruple speed (minimum) - 15 MB free disk space - screen: Super VGA, 256 colors (resolution 640 Ω 480) - Windows 95.
By developing a method by which high resolution microradiographies of irradiated shell grains can be produced, the quality of post-irradiation examinations has been improved.
The resolution of REM is about 20 nm, the upper limit is at least 1000 microns.
The main obstacle to classic image telephony is the bandwidth: With the traditionally switched telephone lines, it is still difficult to transmit an image of good resolution with a sufficiently high repetition frequency to really give the impression of movement.
The image sensor developed by IMEC provides a better resolution in the center of the image (according to the fovea) than at its edge (retina), using a very limited number (8013) at image points.
With the EISS browser, images can be found and viewed with low resolution.
Equipped with the right signal converter, any TV device purchased today can receive digital programs, only not with the high resolution.
The stereoscopic projection table by BARON shows crystal-clear images of computer workstations with high resolution and PC graphics cards.
The resulting demand led to the development of CCD color image devices with high resolution.
However, numerous users use the range of IVP products from slower devices with lower resolution.
Spa has high resolution, low time constant, easy compatibility with computer control and the ability to function within a wide temperature range
As a mechatronic device, the SPA-Effek-tor / sensor offers some desirable characteristics such as high resolution, low time constant, easy compatibility with computer control and the ability to function within a wide temperature range and is suitable for the development of intelligent mechanisms.
The correlation spectrometers use the correlation technology to improve the resolution otherwise limited by the specifically long reactor pulse.
The core of the project is "MGW," a "smart media streaming server" that allows content to be distributed on separate networks, in which the audio / video bit rate, resolution and format are changed.
The Space Apphcations Institute, a member of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), has published a report outlining a new methodology for mapping the forests of Europe using an advanced high-resolution radiometer (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer, AVHRR).
The measuring device is based on the application of a supra spectral sensor with appropriate spatial resolution, which is potentially supplemented by an infrared sensor with a lower resolution;
This will be the first time that such a "snapshot" of planet Earth has been compiled in terms of resolution and capture / coverage.
The themes of the projects presented were: Ways of supporting the Altimetri for climate prediction, monitoring of marine pollution, use of Earth observation to assess the health of European forests, the PELCOM project, the objective of which is the creation of an "upgradable" map of Europe with a resolution of 1 km, evaluation of the impact of UV radiation and monitoring of ozone levels.
The data should be obtained from the output of meteorological models and low-resolution satellite data.
The third lot involves managing a processing chain for low-resolution satellite data.
Operation of the MARS de data includes data derived from a global circulation model, low-resolution satellite data and derived products; mapping and providing the results; updating the associated MARS database.
Siemens dealt with data quality, as fixed models require a much higher resolution and accuracy than normal scans.
And finally, it has commissioned the École Nationale Supérieure de Physique de Strasbourg (ENSPS) to develop a high-speed memory card that can store 2000 images with the full resolution of 512,512 pixels.
The resolution of this vectorial equation according to the coordinate directions leads to the accelerations acting in x, y and z directions.
An excerpt from a measurement letter is reproduced in picture 43, with two times the signal frequency, of which once with high resolution, is recorded.
One advantage of empirical comparison with the teoretic determination of categories is that it is possible to determine their general applicability and reliability in the resolution of ambiguities in real texts.
The resolution takes place again in the source language; if simultaneously translated into several languages, individual meanings can only be entered into these programs at certain points.
This could lead to an increase in the resolution of ultrasound testing.
For reasons of higher accuracy (greater resolution) in the simulation on the hybrid computer and the uniform standardisation of the entire road for arbitrary diagrams, the coefficients of the linear rolling road model for setpoint deviations were calculated and multiplied by factors for amplitude standardisation.
A full volume scanning with a high-resolution radar (such as the one in Chilbolton) would take too long.
Of these data, those with the low resolution (10 s) were only used to examine long durations (greater than 32 s), while those with the high resolution were used to describe the process as a whole.
The shortcomings there, such as insufficient resolution and too long response times, are currently a major obstacle to the inclusion of certain innovation-relevant information in databases.
The research project of IRSID (47) uses a new generation of X-ray radiation detectors with a photodiode line, which enables the simultaneous acquisition of a large number of measuring points with the same accuracy, but with a finer resolution than with existing measuring devices.
However, the use of the new resolution has the advantage that the differences in surface temperature over the length of the absorbers flowing through can now be seen.
The dissolution of this model of price flexibility is achieved by balancing supply and demand.
The dissolution of the model leads us to set three marginal quotas.
The improvement of non-destructive methods with high spatial and temporal resolution that characterize, for example, bioactive interfaces (structure, function, stability) and the design of miniaturized converters for devices based on biological function.
The ability to combine high and low resolution images recorded simultaneously from the same platform allows for much more accurate analysis.
A zoom effect with high resolution and the same spectral bands make it possible to describe almost every image point better.
The radiometric resolution was adapted to measure the differences caused by soil growth - and not just the large contrasts that meteorologists need.
Using low-resolution (1 km) images taken by the NOAA (National Océanography and Atmospheric Administration) American weather observation satellites, the JRC has developed a map of all tropical forests on Earth.
This inventory was only possible due to several technological developments in the field of radar wave probes (microwave probes) with low spatial resolution.
Their aim is to track the development of tropical forest areas almost simultaneously through the combined use of images with both low and high resolution.
The high resolution images then allow the affected region to be analysed in detail and the size of the existing forest areas to be precisely determined.
A new type of sonar • In the field of marine technology and within the framework of the project ACID (Acoustic Imaging Development) a new generation of sonars has been developed, whose peculiarity is that they provide images whose resolution is independent of the distance between the detector and the target object.
(Dissolution by the Annual General Meeting)
By scanning documents, the content of paper pages can be saved as a computer file containing an image of the source document with a certain resolution.
The resolution of a scanner is expressed in "dots per inch" (dpi).
Color scanners can currently easily reach a resolution of 300 or 600 dpi.
The resolution of a fax scanner is much lower (100 to 200 dpi).
Due to the low resolution and poor print quality, optical character recognition for faxes is often difficult to use.
Henning T. rips two cables from the stereo, knots them to a noose and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
It called on governments in the region to commit to sustainable land use and sustainable facilities that are not at the expense of the natural resources of Southeast Asia - mainly forests.
Some investors appear to be banking on safe assets such as gold.
For this, investors in Europe hold an average of more than 34 percent short-term investments compared to 14 percent in the US.
For this, short-term investments in Europe are more than twice as heavily weighted.
Especially for small countries such as Switzerland, where the possibilities for the distribution of investments and the selection of securities are limited due to the size of the domestic capital market, the investment of securities abroad is of great importance.
In recent years, the economy has benefited greatly from global demand for US assets, especially debt in the form of securities that financed a large current account deficit.
The whole financial universe - investment and trade - has been increasingly covered for 100 years like hardly any other financial market:
Previously, sustainable investment was primarily about filtering out plants in "poorly regarded" industries such as alcohol, weapons and tobacco.
Such investments as shareholdings or cash reserves form the active side.
What about the currency risk - should investments be hedged?
In a broad comparison, we therefore assume that the risk-return ratio of investments in the emerging markets will improve in the future.
Plant guru Jim Rogers once said at a plant in the emerging markets it would be best to buy what the emerging markets themselves buy, namely raw materials.
A new era of sustainable plants
Initial approaches only excluded plants in "sin sectors" such as alcohol, weapons or tobacco.
At Credit Suisse, we define sustainable investment as the explicit recognition that environmental, social and governance factors can affect the ability of companies to generate long-term returns.
Our research methodology for sustainable investments begins with an analysis of the sustainability opportunities and risks that can fundamentally affect a company's ability to secure its profitability.
Why do sustainable plants and sustainably managed companies receive so much more public attention today than they did ten years ago?
Because of disasters like Fukushima or Deepwater Horizon, investors are questioning how their investments affect the environment and society.
The market turbulence of recent times has also increased awareness of sustainable investments.
Do you assume that the trend towards sustainable investments will remain limited to purely niche areas such as environmental technology, or will the consideration of ESG criteria establish itself as a permanent trend among investors worldwide?
We want to offer investors our know-how in the field of sustainable investments, play a visible and important role in this and at the same time participate in the steady growth in this area.
For investment and banking products, the consulting process, the instruments we offer and - most importantly - our employees,"adds Pauli.
"Returns are important, no question," explains Pauli,"but good advice, including a clear rationale that speaks for or against an investment, is just as significant."
"Investing has become a very complex matter," explains Nicole Pauli,"and from a certain point on, product specialists are required who have specific, detailed knowledge of a plant."
For example, the specialists from asset management for assets in funds and alternative investments or the investment bankers for strategic decisions such as an IPO or a merger and finally the advisers of private banking for the management of private assets.
For example, value investing goes to Benjamin Graham and David Dodd and their 1934 investment standard work "Security Analysis" (German:
Speaking to John Maynard Keynes, supporters of the Contrarian strategy take the following view: "A fundamental principle of investing is to oppose the prevailing opinion, because if everyone agrees on the merits of an investment, it is necessarily too expensive and therefore unattractive."
On the one hand, the increased risk aversion, given the debt problems in Greece and Spain, would speak in favour of an escape to safe assets.
On the other hand, from the point of view of a foreign investor, an investment in Franken would represent a diversification in the portfolio.
In addition, cash flows into indexed products hit a relatively illiquid market, forcing investors from passively managed mandates into investments at a yield level that we believe is not sustainable.
The true dimension was evident in the publication of the Bank's results for the third quarter of 2011: The new Basel III rules would have allowed risk-weighted assets (risk-weighed assets or RWA) in investment banking to rise to more than double, largely due to fixed income investments.
The lack of investment alternatives and the worldwide high liquidity in investors' depots also speak in favour of investing in shares.
One makes a decision (buys a plant) and hopes for a positive impact (wants to get a return).
It is a measure of the yield fluctuations of an investment around its mean value.
Instruments with very low risk, such as most money market investments, will receive a one, while very high-risk investments such as options will receive a five.
This is particularly important in view of the currently very unusual market environment for fixed income investments, which is characterised by exceptionally low returns and a lack of supply of safe assets.
For investors who want to share in the potential of stock markets but are unwilling to bear all the associated risks, an investment in convertible bonds is an option.
Many company founders are also looking for ways to convert some of their assets tied into liquid assets and diversify into unsecured and uncorrelated assets.
Long-term investments in the oil, mining, manufacturing and transportation sectors are more stable than investments in stocks and bonds currently pulled from other emerging markets.
Responsible plants offer new opportunities
For example, the first comprehensive investment report from seven regions around the world by the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance (GSIA) in 2013 states that at least USD 13.6 trillion of professionally managed assets now apply so-called ESG criteria (environmental, social and governance considerations, environmental, social and governance criteria) to the selection and management of their investments.
This corresponds to around 22 percent of the assets under management from these regions and shows that sustainable investments in the regions studied have reached a critical mass overall.
The final panel discussion dealt with the central topic of "Impact Investing," i.e. investments which, in addition to their financial return, also bring about social and / or environmental improvements thanks to sustainable corporate growth.
With reference to the collapse of the Rana factory building in Bangladesh in April 2013, which caused more than 1100 deaths and around 1000 serious injuries among the sewers employed there, Oliver Niedermaier explained that long-term investors such as sovereign wealth funds, Ultra High Net Worth Individuals and pension funds regard this type of facility as particularly attractive:
Responsible Investment (RI) or responsible investing is an investment approach that takes environmental, social and governance aspects ("Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations") into account when choosing and managing investments.
We have been able to raise funds quickly, particularly in alternative plants, and we now need to industrialise all processes - from marketing to sales.
Speaking of growth in alternative plants: What is this demand due to?
In my opinion, the AM meets these requirements with its first-class products in the area of alternative and traditional equipment as well as its strong multi-asset class solutions business.
How do you ensure a solid investment and risk management process?
What does this mean in terms of plants?
The new, hand-picked investment themes and ideas from Credit Suisse's Investment Strategy & Research team have been developed to help you get the most out of your investment in the second half of 2014.
Giles Keating, head of research, explains the thinking behind the ideas and the impact of the plant.
"For example, European customers like to delegate their investments and often opt for asset management mandates.
The third factor could play a role, although we do not have explicit government requirements regarding installations.
Life insurance companies such as pension funds, which have traditionally built heavily on fixed-rate assets, are facing problems.
Given their risk profile and also because of investment guidelines (BVG), it will be difficult for these investors to increase their share of riskier assets such as equities or high-interest bonds.
This debt reduction means that market participants liquidate their emerging market investments.
Stock exchanges are now owned by shareholders who expect a reasonable return on capital for their investment.
The boom was triggered in 2001 by too little housing supply, significant job growth, expansionist monetary policy and the trend of households to shift their investments from shares to residential property.
In addition to traditional direct investment, there is a whole range of alternatives that avoid the possible disadvantages of such an investment, such as low liquidity and lack of transparency.
Put simply, I decide whether we invest more in bonds, shares, cash or alternative investments, as well as the allocation of various sub-asset categories such as loans, hedge funds or private equity, such as regions, countries and styles, such as substance values (value stocks) or growth values (growth stocks).
He now gives a number of ways to cover the megatrends "demographic developments," "multipolar world" and "sustainability" with a single facility.
That would then be the right environment to engage intensively with plants that take these megatrends into account.
In fact, the investment in countries with weaker economic growth has delivered high returns in the past.
The primary investment theme for an investment in India is consumption, i.e. an investment in non-cyclical consumer goods, personal care products, electronic products, upscale goods such as cars and mobile phones or luxury goods.
For each profile it is specified in which bandwidths the bonds, the shares, the alternative investments and the currencies may move.
The American data gives an approximate idea of the potential returns of plants to farmland.
Plants in farmland would have been a good admixture for most depots over the last two decades.
Only the right harvest year makes a fine wine a good plant.
The report also provides valuable data for the important top-down analysis of assets and places current market concerns about sovereign debt in the right context: It proves that the estimated $42 trillion of global public debt in 2009 is only one-fifth of the $195 trillion of global household wealth,"explained Giles Keating.
At the same time, they open up interesting opportunities for investments in companies that benefit from this development.
Danish entrepreneur and venture capitalist Morten Lund learned this on his own when a position in his portfolio of more than 80 assets - the most famous of which was the internet phone and video software Skype - became worthless in 2009, taking him by the entire fortune.
The development of exclusive offerings has led to new structured products, tailored investments and new investment funds, such as a $750-million loan fund.
We can support customers in all areas - from pure asset formation to the stage where they need complex solutions to investment and investment issues."
"Our biggest competition in recent years has been passive plants," explains Küffer.
He was involved in two companies and had made some of his investments into money through an IPO of both companies.
"It has already happened that we have advised an internationally active listed company on mergers and capital markets while providing personal investment or financial advice to the family holding company," says Fleuriot.
In general, therefore, it is fair to say that - with the right advice and care - hedge fund investments are not necessarily riskier than traditional investments.
Alternative investments therefore remain an important part of any capital allocation.
Unlike in the 1990s, the minimum interest rate can no longer be achieved with an almost risk-free investment such as Swiss federal bonds.
However, the investment of coupons and repayment amounts of the bonds at higher interest rates compensates for the loss of market value in the long term.
However, in times of negative real interest rates, it cannot be considered an adequate investment for the medium and long term, as the investor has to accept a real asset loss.
By expanding the range of products and services in the fields of philanthropy, microfinance, sustainable investments and so-called "impact investing," Swiss banks could therefore open up interesting new business areas.
However, against the background of latent and difficult to forecast structural inflationary pressures, we are already increasingly relying on real assets.
Real assets form a cornerstone of our investment strategy.
The economic progress, the generous liquidity supply of central banks, the continued favourable or appropriate valuation of riskier investments and the continuing investment pressure should further push the financial market pendulum towards opportunities.
In the case of alternative plants, too, the right mix of these heterogeneous plants must once again be put together.
Unlike the euro or the dollar, risk-free investments in Swiss francs still generate a positive return.
Should states be offered a menu with just one dish or a meal à la carte?
I personally believe that the invention of eating à la carte compared to the menu with just one dish that matched the barracks' eating habits was a major step forward for civilisation.
"We're just pointing out how meals that make thick can be replaced with low-calorie yet tasty dishes."
In addition, some dishes are complete meals, while others are made entirely of vegetables.
The protein / energy ratio (7 g per 100 kcal) recommended for dishes prepared only with meat is above the value of an infused beef half (5 g per 100 kcal), but is significantly lower than that for chicken, poultry and fish (15 g per 100 kcal).
Fruit juices (with or without added sugar), nectar (diluted fruit juice, usually with added sugar) and dishes made exclusively of fruit have long been part of the diet of the infant to be breastfed throughout Europe.
The committee's recommendations allow for a slight increase in the natural carbohydrate content (up to a total value of 15g per 100ml in fruit and nectar and up to 20g per 100g in a dish made only of fruit), which is designed to allow the flavour to be matched.
Changes in dietary habits were also due to the explosive development of travel activity, mobility, the emergence of restaurants, among others, offering foreign dishes, and the increasing popularity of foreign food.
Paella The dish comes from the Spanish rice growing area on the Mediterranean coast, the region of Valencia.
A few days later, when he was presented with the same court again, he used his detector to detect ionizing radiation at the time something completely new and tremendously impressive and found that the food was radioactive.
He gave a little of a radioactive substance into the food leftovers on his plate, and when the same dish was presented to him again, he used his radiation detector and found that the food was radioactive.
There are also gluten-free alternatives and dishes for allergy sufferers."
Consequently, there is a great need for ready meals, which has led to the development of new food products and packaging such as TV dinners and pre-cooked dishes that are ready to eat or only need to be warmed in the microwave.
Examples of products already used in the production of these materials include store-stable dishes, snacks such as potato chips and peanuts and also the ultra-light "brick-shaped" vacuum packaging for coffee.
Within a generation, our food has become more varied and diverse - we eat food and dishes from across Europe and around the world.
In each school, the most successful dishes were awarded, and these recipes were published in the journal "Ha Kuriren."
She learned how to prepare Italian dishes and especially desserts with fresh ingredients from the surrounding area.
If you like to travel in this way, you have to find these wonderful places, be sure to get a good reception and taste authentic regional dishes.
Guests enjoyed traditional Finnish dishes based on reindeer, salmon and caviar, as well as Finnish beers.
This event, under the auspices of the President and the Secretary General of the EESC and organised in cooperation with Hervé Coupeau (Group III - Various Interests), representatives of the young farmers of France and the French overseas departments in the Committee, presented typical products and culinary specialities from Martinique, Guadeloupe, Réunion, Guayana and Corsica, as well as traditional dishes and drinks.
If you then add a little flexibility and freedom so that a group can exchange dishes with one another, you may even achieve an even higher level of satisfaction.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in several places in their volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Crowd: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I've also worked at the school in open all-day.
What are your experiences with this?
Crowd: It's a beautiful, broad spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
They are now 26 years, so a late-career volunteer.
How come that?
Crowd: I graduated from high school.
And then a civil engineering degree, let's say, successfully aborted.
I realized for myself that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something different, work with people.
And then I wondered what are you doing.
Make a social year, there's a glimpse, there you can see how it really is on the ground, in the focal point maybe as well.
And was it?
Crowd: I've collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in the social sector in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably do social worker training at the Herne Youth Office and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Isn't it a bit unusual to have several different locations during volunteering?
Crowd: Yes, it's very variable.
It probably always comes down to where you do your FSJ.
You can do it from retirement home to youth work - in all sorts of facets of social work.
With me it was very varied.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, that was just the right thing that irritated me.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really plays out.
Unlike in civil engineering studies?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating statistics.
You always have other people in front of you, who each have a very different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, whether a youngster who has been taken out of the family - you always have to go into it individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no fear of touch?
Crowd: I'm not the type for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also sometimes negative moments, but so is life.
But the planning of the invasion of Iraq, in which Rumsfeld advocated the deployment of fewer troops than proposed, suggests an inadequate understanding of distributed systems.
Those who wanted to limit the use of jurors apparently feared a risk to state security in some cases.
Nearly three billion sank the budget for various compensation for victims of communism and crime, or for expenses for the court disputes, even for building savings.
Local authorities could not confirm the identities of the victims, but two US counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
The first two victims were hospitalized seriously injured, where the eighty-year-old passed away.
The attorney for Samantha Geimer, the victim, also again demanded the criminal case be overturned.
Werner Söllner is not only a perpetrator, but also a victim, as far as we know.
The troops are heaped with praise for their victims.
Mario Monti, future Italian leader, has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that demands "sacrifices" to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
If France were to decide to phase out nuclear power, a large proportion of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and the annual EUR 6 billion in exports of capital goods and nuclear energy would shrink more and more.
For my group, it is particularly positive to see that the development initiated by the rejection of the budget by this House has now begun to resolve the problems.
But time and again, forces are making themselves felt, leading to a dissolution in the shield, although EuroPilot, the organisation of European pilots, also declares that Eurocontrol is the solution of European air traffic control.
The resolution of the Committee on Transport draws attention to the urgent case of Eurocontrol and calls for its dissolution to be avoided, or at least for its specific, albeit limited, functioning to be maintained.
What was the Commission's assessment of the recent dissolution of political parties in Turkey by the military junta?
Europe is changing under our eyes, but, and this should be stressed, with the result of the dissolution and destruction not only of the area, but also of the family, culture and society: This is the Europe of the indifferent, not the Europe of the peoples.
Further proliferation of nuclear weapons as a result of the dissolution of the former Soviet Union must, I believe, be prevented.
The question that arises, however, is whether the separation, the dissolution will end the disputes, or whether they will continue in view of the new geopolitical connections that are now being formed, which are unlikely to allow peaceful life in the Balkans.
The dangers of the dissemination of technology and technical know-how for the production of (nuclear, chemical, biological) weapons of mass destruction have increased significantly after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
Their despair is the result of the dissolution of Yugoslavia and the failure of the responsible leaders to agree on how the peoples of the former Yugoslavia should live together.
It is also otherwise foggy when it says that other institutions could be dissolved following the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact.
You are basically asking the Community the question: Deepening the federal state or dissolving it into a free trade area?
Unfortunately, however, the developments to date following the overthrow of the socialist camp and the dissolution of the USSR, the statements by the representatives of NATO and America, the blatant attacks or interventions against independent states demonstrate the importance of the character and objectives of any kind of conversion of the arms industry and conversion of military sites.
But this is no wonder: No country on earth, not even the richest and most developed Western country, could have withstood the sudden 85 percent drop in its own trade, as happened in Cuba through the dissolution of COMECON.
His dissolution of parliament, dismissal of the judges and provisional repeal of the constitution, his imprisonment of a large number of people and, of course, his ban on the free press - much of it is not only questionable when it comes to a democracy, but directly unlawful.
B3 - 002 / 94 - 0 - 278 / 93) by Mr Moran López and others to the Commission for the dissolution of the "Gibraltar Social Insurance Fund."
There is no question that the dissolution of a number of African states, including Somalia, Liberia and Burundi, which Hen Pons Grau mentions in his report, together with the social and economic destabilisation that ultimately led to civil wars, have played a decisive role in the increase in the number of refugees.
Firstly, because we must not confuse the "integration" of the Member States into the Community or the Union with their "dissolution" in the same.
Perhaps things could have taken a different course from the beginning, from the hasty dissolution of Yugoslavia; many sides, including the European Community, are partly responsible for the current situation - secession, war, ethnic cleansing, national homogenisation, intolerance, territorial conquests, obvious incompatibility, acts of violence, cruelty, enmities that will continue for a long time to come.
After the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, these countries are seeking the path to democracy and a social market economy.
Following the political events following this signing, in particular the dissolution of the Kazakh Parliament by President Nazarbaiev, our Parliament felt compelled to suspend the ratification procedure for this agreement until parliamentary elections were held.
There are disturbing reports of experiments carried out on humans in Ukraine after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
Strengthening Europe is not possible through its dissolution.
This includes an immediate dissolution of the military and civilian repression apparatus, the criminal prosecution of the paramilitaries, an end to impunity and compensation for the victims.
The Commission endorses the conclusions of the Vienna Summit, which provide for the disarmament and dissolution of these militias and the deployment of a United Nations mission to reduce tensions.
There is one thing I would like to highlight in this debate: Today we are witnessing the dissolution and destruction of Kosovo and of an entire people.
The recent municipal and regional elections have been declared invalid, and the military has assumed legislative and executive power following the dissolution of the National Assembly.
The standard of living of their population has fallen steadily, insecurity and the influence of various mafias have increased alarmingly, and the state is on the path of dissolution.
This includes the free repair, replacement, reduction of the purchase price or the dissolution of the contract in the case of defective goods.
- the EU recognised the new states resulting from the dissolution of the Soviet Union (the Baltic States in September 1991), Yugoslavia (Slovenia and Croatia in January 1992, Bosnia-Herzegovina in April 1992 and Macedonia in 1995) and Czechoslovakia (the Czech Republic and Slovakia in January 1993);

Dissolution; termination of a company which precedes or follows the liquidation of the company, i.e. the sale of the company's assets, the satisfaction of the creditors and the distribution of the remaining assets among the shareholders.
The subject of this analysis is the relocation of the "seat" of a society without dissolution, as the task states.
The addition "without dissolution" makes it clear that these are the rules of international private law that determine which law is relevant to a company and whether a company is to be regarded as a legally founded legal person.
The present investigation is limited to the question of whether the rules of the Member States in the field of company law and private international law should be aligned in such a way as to allow companies to move their actual registered office to another Member State without dissolution.
(1) the law governing a company; (2) the amendment of the law governing a company; (3) the possibility of relocating the registered office of a company without dissolution from the founding state; (4) the possibility of relocating the registered office to another Member State while retaining the legal personality of the company.
This requires the dissolution of society in the state of departure and the reestablishment in the state of destination.
However, the case law does not allow, in all Member States applying the seat theory, one company to move its administrative seat to another without dissolution.
In some Member States, this would lead to the dissolution of society:
In all Member States, a company may relocate its administrative headquarters within the jurisdiction of the State concerned without dissolution.
(1) Companies should be able to move their administrative headquarters, i.e. their actual headquarters, to another Member State without dissolution.
(2) Companies are entitled, on the grounds of freedom of establishment, to relocate their actual seat without dissolution (subject to the rules applicable in the Member States for reasons of transport protection).
This is a step backwards for those Member States that apply the seating theory and allow the transfer of seats without dissolution.
The withdrawing State may delete these registers only on the basis of evidence of the dissolution of the company in accordance with the legislation of a Member State governing the company.

Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it will cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 per cent as another restructuring programme is launched to overcome the pressures facing the company.
The job cuts, which Director General John Fallon mostly announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019, comes on top of its previous restructuring, which has already seen 4,000 jobs lost.
Pearson announced in a third cost-cutting programme in May a plan to cut costs by a further 300 million pounds ($394 million) to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it posted a 1 per cent increase to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing a Nato soldier and injuring several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a statement from Nato said.
Unconfirmed local reports said three civilians also died in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest act of violence to hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed at a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A statement from Nato said Thursday night's explosion happened when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "person-carried improvised explosive device."
The statement says all of the injured are in stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group, known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh, is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out that attack.
On May 31, a huge bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's deadliest militant attack since U.S.-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs increasing the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has overturned a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance so-called "2015 ozone regulations" and said it showed the agency's commitment to work with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA's intention to delay ozone regulations - in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in part of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet stricter air quality standards - by a year until October 2018.
A group of 15 largely Democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, filed suit on Tuesday, saying that the effort was illegal.

However, the effort has triggered the setback from Democrats and conservation groups, who worry about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPA's website says that inhaling air that contains ozone "can reduce lung function and amplify respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
The rules are not yet definitive, but formal adoption in the European Parliament and the European Council is scheduled for later this spring.

One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, he would provide a living space - around 55 square feet - and an adjacent terrace with as much as 70 square feet of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the local council intend to provide such a common space not as a meeting place only for the residents of senior-appropriate housing, but openly into the community.
As an example, the word "knitting café" made the rounds.
The decision, which was pre-decided by the allocation of funds for the current budget last autumn, will be sweetened by funding opportunities.

Wandering in the resin from star to star
In the resin, the first "Star Path" is to be created nationwide.
This is planned by the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" would meet the information needs of many resin visitors, it said.
It combines nature, science, movement and athletic performance.
The members want to set up panels along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well-attainable installations at five to six locations" in the upper resin.
St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber would be eligible.
The information on the boards will be supplemented via the Internet.
This is why good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations.
Accessibility was also a criterion.
Later the star path Zug is to be extended by train.
"On the star path, viewers learn a lot of things worth knowing about, for example, the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
They also learned why stars have different colors or why one star shines more strongly than another, even though it lies much further away.
It is also taught which constellation a selected star is in and when it is best to see it.
The association has been operating the highest observatory in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg since 2014.
The site in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
From there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy can be seen clearly with the naked eye.
Since 2003, on the initiative of the funding association Planetarium Göttingen, there has been something similar to the planned Starwerg - the Planetary Path.
Starting in front of Gebhard's hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its steles leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (municipality of Equals) with the planet Sedna.
The steles with the individual planets - including the Pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth thus shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun, standing exactly 75 meters away, measures 70 centimeters.
The total distance of the planetary path is a good four kilometers.
While the light from sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to get to the stele with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in space.

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were due to be on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Showtime on Saturday, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said,"How are you going, champion?
I wish you good luck. "
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I went up for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to lightweight.
And he needs to move on lightweights [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans demand.
Let's give them that. "
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy Lomachenko will have to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also has interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight at the Forum on September 23.
"This fight could be in pay-per-view mode because all the fans have asked for it," Garcia said, later expressing himself openly to fight at the network, which offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they're ready...""
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "a tremendous fighter," and he will possibly take part in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the lavish praise for Garcia, saying that he thinks the three-match champion from Riverside look "very slow, sorry Mikey... you wanted the co-off after all."
Garcia said the focus was to show hitting strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum building up for their own fight.
"This is the fight that needs to be carried out.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it,"Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It's going to be a great fight. "

The car slammed to the right into the embankment, where it overturned and then remained lying on the roof in the green strip.
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were partly seriously injured in the accident.
The A7 was closed to the north for about an hour during the emergency service's initial supply of the injured, after which traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site.
This is good advice on land, too, but it is all the more important under water because of the poor light conditions.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Triple chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes the optimisation of the defensive formation in Aue brings points after the 2-2 win at the start of the season against Braunschweig.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first game of the season, with the result, too, had it not been for the two goals in the 2-2 against Braunschweig.
"Those were two opponent goals too much and we have to pay even better attention in Aue," says the Fortuna Düsseldorf defensive player.
In the Ore Mountains, the triple chain is also to be further optimized.
And a goal after a free-kick the fortunes don't want to catch any more.
"For the future, it's going to be the case that no one is putting themselves on the line alongside Michael (Rensing) anymore."
Hoffmann is convinced that even after the experience in the preparation, his team can cope better with the three-chain than with the four-chain.
"I still don't know how we're going to act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause,"because we have players who can build up well right now in the triple chain on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann," Hoffmann said.
"Prerequisite, though, is that we harmonize even better and we don't afford as many playoff errors in the build-up."
Of course, Hoffmann is also heading to Aue to win the game.
"But whether you can talk about a failed start after a draw doesn't know.
The performance could well be okay,"said Hoffmann.
"However, if we can get away with four points on Sunday and focus on the cup, we'll certainly be able to talk about a proper start to the season."
His coach didn't want to know about that.
"I don't judge the start to the season until after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to speak of an advantage over Aue just because the Saxons' game in Heidenheim had to be canceled prematurely because of a storm.
"Now they can virtually start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann believes the players from Aue might even be a little fresher as they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a rising favourite in the bones.
"But they don't know as 100 per cent where they currently stand," says the Fortuna interior defender.
Although the guests from the Rhineland will go into the encounter at the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue as a slight favourite on Sunday.
"That we sweep them away just because we are entitled to get under the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose record in just one defeat against Aue from nine games is thoroughly positive.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat in the first place," explains Fortuna's head coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And so Funkel definitely doesn't want to experience his players on Sunday.

On the day the Supreme Court convenes behind closed doors to discuss the politically divisive question of whether to hear a challenge to President Obama's health care laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will represent the case in court.
The lawyer who will stand trial and claim that the law is to be overturned will presumably be Paul Clement, once attorney general under the administration of George W. Bush.
The dinner took place at a Washington hotel just hours after the court deliberated on the case.
"This startling break with morality and the contrast to the code belies the lawsuits of some judges, the court is abiding by the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the US.
"The judges won and dined with lawyers with pending proceedings at the court during a benefit event."
Kagan was attorney general under the Obama administration when the first legal challenges came to court in the first instance.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed his decision was based on independence from judicial power and government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the extradition.

Bray elaborated that the "outraged" response to the eviction of their tent camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came all the way to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the violent eviction of the square and allowing the protesters to camp.

New results of Swedish asylum age assessment tests published
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which underwent a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of those tested are older than 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests last year.
They are to make age assessment more accurate during the asylum process after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years old."
The tests will only be carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months.
"We don't see much difference in the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are pretty constant," he told the magazine The Local.
The high proportion of cases where the person was judged to be over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases that "suggest that the person examined was 18 years or older."
When the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of those cases, the person had openly said that she was turning 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which involves X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI recordings of knee joints, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
One skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure, we shouldn't pretend we could,"he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in this case this is about 10 per cent. "

Full in the plan
Work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-tonne piece of concrete was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We're very good at the time, it's going super," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Road and Transport at the regional office of Freiburg.
In April, work began at the same time on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach in need of refurbishment.
Construction is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure the timetable will be met.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a vaulted arch bridge made of concrete clad in red coloured sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 metres.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it is now in the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now being thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red coloured sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30-metre wide and seven-tonne so-called bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning.
This is a border fastening, which is also used as an operating route.
A 2.20-metre-wide bridge cap is due to be deployed on the southern part of the bridge on Friday.
Then the pedestrian path should run.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps.
The laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach required a special sensitivity.
Because there is also a fiber optic cable, to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the collecting pond in the direction of Schramberg, the traffic is regulated single-lane by a traffic light.
The road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is fully closed for the construction work on the bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach.
The total cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000.
The whole thing is financed by the country.

AfD in Gerolstein: Colorful protest at German potato salad
It is not so common for parties to pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to reconcile.
The parties (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left) represented in Vulkaneifel County Day belong to a broad alliance that peacefully flags that day because the AfD in the Gerolstein town hall invites Rondell to the "big campaign launch," according to the poster.
And brings familiar names to the launch - such as Alice Weidel, who along with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the federal election on September 24, and Deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are on the scene hours before the event begins don't want to listen to the AfD people, they want to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful."
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the slogan "All at a table" on the fountain square, but is now taking place in the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus right in front of the eyes of those coming to the AfD event in the town hall.
A colorful picture.
And what Christa Karoli, chairwoman of the Forum One World and one of the authoritative organisers, is really pleased with: "Great how many people have come together here."
There's music and plenty of food, including a "primordial German potato salad that the AfD could easily eat," says the woman who brought him along.
Police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, showing presence especially at the station, which is just yards away from the venues.
How did the AfD actually get on Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he has sought such an event and won the award.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked in Daun, but received a cancellation there because there were not enough parking spaces because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a beautiful event here."
Looking ahead to the event on the Rondell forecourt, he says: "This is people's good right, main thing, it remains peaceful."
That's what it does: Around 8 p.m., a band provides entertainment on the Rondellvorplatz, in the Stadthalle various speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
In the room are about 200 listeners waiting for the front-runner for the federal election, Alice Weidel, and Deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix von Storch to deliver their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far officials have had a quiet evening.
The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there is scheduled to clean up shortly after 9pm.
The police can step down - no special occurrences.

Trombone hits trumpet
A rehearsal with the Wolfsburg trombonist Frederic Belli will take place in the series of Haslacher monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 20 o'clock in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest," or even "Balkan folklore" meets a classical German education with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov is a solo trumpeter with the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a solo trombonist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to push the boundaries on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
This is how Johann Sebastian Bach sounds with the two as if in a new guise, Daniel Schnyder's "world music" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by the jazz chop-winner Nils Wogram, classical, jazz and free playing blend into a fascinating overall work of art.
This centerpiece of the program was only premiered this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and even more: The Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.

Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything,"Kristen Stewart candidly tweeted about her bisexuality.
"Once I bite into grilled cheese, I think,' Oh that was cool, what's next? '."
Arguably the Hollywood star's best-known relationship was with her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who ended up bitterly apart.
Despite all this, the brunette performer assures "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I would have played it? "
After their separation, Kristen admitted she was bisexual: 'I've always lived dualism and seriously believed in it.
So it has never confused or hindered me.
I just never liked not being taken seriously. "
She suffered particularly from this, according to "Bang Showbiz" but in school time, when she preferred to dress like a Bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I would look like a Bub.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think to myself, 'Girl, be proud of you!'. "
She doesn't like explaining her love life to the public in particular: 'People expect you to relate in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some call me ungrateful, but I don't like having to justify myself in front of the whole public. "
West Virginia governor announces he's changing party
. The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he will change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me,"Governor Justice said.
"Today I'll tell you with a lot of prayers and a lot of thought... today I'll tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can't help you anymore if I'm a Democratic governor."
The rally erupted in jubilation.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time to play a different game."
Mr. Trump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not approve Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and inherited a coal business from his father.
It is worth roughly $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night saying,"Governor Justice's change of party is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us rather than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governorships and control of the fewest legislative bodies in history, Governor Justice's announcement is only the last rejection of a party that is leaderless from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.

Coe praises' honest 'Russian apology for doping scandal
World athletics chief executive Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised what he described as an apparent apology from Russia to a doping scandal, but he reiterated it was not the moment for the country to be welcomed back into the sport.
Russia's athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country's relegation from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were snapped away with gold and silver medals at competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to uphold the ban, which was imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open response today, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The entire council and Congress have been pleased that the Russian Federation has recognised within itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the federation is reshaped."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but Congress supports the task force's recommendations that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia," Coe said.
"We've got to do everything we can over the next few months to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the tainted system,"he added
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships, which begin in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia had yet to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.

Act of mourning for soldiers who crashed in Mali
At a funeral ceremony in Fritzlar, northern Hesse, around 1000 people thought of the two soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place in the cathedral city on Thursday under high security precautions.
On the still unexplained cause of the crash, Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
However, she described the two deceased pilots as "masters of their profession."
"We bow to this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old chief of staff from North Hesse had died in West African Mali a week ago on Wednesday.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and taken to the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter on Thursday accompanied by a death guard from the Bundeswehr.
At noon, at first, only the relatives in the church said goodbye.
Afterwards the funeral ceremony began in the circle of the family, closest friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics.
Among them were Hesse's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Mourners laid down roses, the loved ones stood arm in arm by the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Defence Minister von der Leyen described the soldiers who died as "highly decorated" and deployed.
The chief of staff was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment and helped set up the flight operation of the Tiger combat helicopter in Fritzlar.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment, which includes the soldiers, also declared: "If this crew could not avert the crash, then none would have been able to."
Minister von der Leyen did not show any doubts about the UN mission in Mali: The deployment was dangerous.
But he is also of high importance "to a country from which we are separated only by two states," she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
According to the fair value model of Credit Suisse, the Swiss franc remains undervalued at the euro, even though it has improved from a Swiss franc euro rate of more than 1.60 to around 1.50 since 2007.
The stock markets of developed countries are valued at a price-to-earnings ratio (KGV) of 17 versus a KGV of ten for emerging stock markets.
Value investors focus on the "price" in the price-to-earnings ratio, while growth investors are more interested in the "profit" element of this metric.
Thus, Contrarian investors choose companies that are undervalued and have negative price momentum.
Finally, the euro franc exchange rate remains an issue:
The stronger and more often, for example, the price of a share oscillates, the greater the fluctuation width and the riskier the capital investment.
"The decision of the Swiss National Bank to set the rate at 1.20 was crucial for growth to revive quickly," recalls Melli.
If you look at the price of gold over a longer time series, you have to say that the yellow metal is not exactly cheap at its current price.
Corporate profits and earnings dynamics are recovering from a deep level, and valuations such as the price-to-earnings ratio are also starting to increase in anticipation of rising profits.
In 2010, Geithner had still attracted the attention of the media and Chinese authorities when he complained to the WEF about the yuan's trajectory.
If a rapid appreciation of the Chinese currency is potentially dangerous for the global economy, why is the White House so fixated on the yuan's trajectory?
"Although the price-to-earnings ratio is currently in the range of 2007, we do not expect a significant correction at the moment.
Macroeconomic aspects and corporate profits will not be among the main driving factors, which is why we also expect an expansion of the price-to-earnings ratio in 2013.
Shirakawa forecasts inflation of just 0.6 percent in 2014, which is well below the BOJ's 2 percent target and could lead to the central bank having to weaken the yen rate even further to meet its inflation target.
The highest returns appear to be achieved when dividend yields are high and the price-to-earnings ratio (KGV) is low.
Higher return on equity, higher price-book value ratio and higher pay-out ratio,"said Stefano Natella, Head of Global Equity Research at Credit Suisse's Investment Banking Division.
There are higher price-book value ratios.
The PEG ratios (price-to-earnings ratio divided by profit growth) of most large and almost all medium-sized enterprises are still fairly favorable compared to other emerging markets.
As a result of the strengthening of the Swiss franc, the price of the dollar fell within a few years from around 4.30 Swiss francs to just over 2 Swiss francs.
In addition, the valuations of future price-to-earnings ratios appear attractive as the shares of most companies are listed at the lower end of their historical price range.
Finally, the costs for local companies are rising less than those for their competitors abroad, while the exchange relationship with the euro remains constant at a rate of around 1.20 Swiss francs.
The basic idea behind convertible bonds is that they will be converted into shares if the company's price drops below a certain value.
When the Swiss franc euro rate was at 1.60, that set off much larger margins than now, where the rate is at 1.22.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all assets from its portfolio where money is used for betting on food prices," Bode said.
Only eleven percent therefore consider it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer facilities that bet on food prices.
Many bank customers would also face personal consequences when they learn that their bank is involved in such deals: One in two would cancel any investments where money goes into commodity speculation, according to the survey.
Finally, and this probably says most, our survey of business leaders found that a clear majority want Britain to take a course towards changing the deal and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.

Jiménez felt that micro-credit was a "serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty," and that the governments of the industrialised countries now had to work "more than ever" according to solidarity criteria, and should not allow solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
However, he hesitantly admitted that the strange gravity under which he suffers could be attributed to a more natural, somewhat more palpable cause - namely the severe and protracted illness - indeed the apparently near dissolution - of a tenderly beloved sister - the only companion of long years - of the last and only relatives on earth.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The husband of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
The royal shared that on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple are buried in the cathedral church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband's decision, the memo went on to say.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title.
After his wife Margrethe ascended the throne in 1972, he would have liked to have become king.
He retired in 2016, also releasing the title of "Prince's Supper."
As Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he did not see himself as equal to his wife - even after death, explained Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman for the Danish royal house.
Where the 83-year-old's final resting place will ultimately be is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years.
The native Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French aristocratic family, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
On the Thames, he worked in the French Embassy.
During his later wife the expressions of sympathy of the people always flew, Prince Henrik had a heavy stand with the Danes in his nearly 50-year reign.
In an autobiography, Henrik said of the first few years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was wavering, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitting socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who in this country had a reputation for being the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for leniency.
I was different.
I seemed to be happy with that position and not ashamed of myself.
These were two mistakes at once! "

Prime Minister Weil wants swift re-election
CDU and FDP ahead of possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a speedy re-election of the Landtag after losing the red-green government majority, but he does not want to resign.
Weil on Friday advocated the dissolution of parliament.
Previously, the surprise exit of a Greens MP from her state parliamentary group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the state election, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
The previous Greens MP Elke Twesten justified her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she declared in Hanover on Friday.
CDU group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his group to include them.
That would give the CDU and FDP a combined 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Landtag, SPD and Greens 68.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new Landtag will be elected regularly on 14 January next year.
Thümler said the red-green state government must now decide whether it could continue to govern in this situation without a majority.
However, Stephan Weil considers it essential that the Landtag decides on its self-dissolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU group is expected to decide on how to proceed on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility of the Landtag stripping the prime minister of confidence and electing a successor.
"Our constitution offers several options.
These opportunities need to be examined legally neatly,"Thümler said.
"You'll calmly discuss all the issues if they are legally properly considered."
Thümler called TWest's move "a little odd, after all."
The politician herself stressed: "I'm not a traitor.
I feel very good. "
She described herself as a supporter of black-green.
The Greens called on the breakaway MP to return her state parliament mandate.
"We assume, of course, that she will return her state parliament mandate, which she received via the Green Land List, with immediate effect," state chairmen Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner told reporters.
Greens leader Anja Piel said: "We are extremely sorry for Elke Twesten's decision."
She had deliberately chosen not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even against the background that there were no substantive differences, we can't fathom this move."
SPD chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the move of Lower Saxony Greens MP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.

Agriculture Minister in interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany discusses contaminated eggs
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves.
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) speaks and answers in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to take a close look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information on the affected egg batches.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we currently know, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Is Aldi now taking on the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enlightener is not really being played by the Federal Agriculture Minister?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has opened immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since Germany became aware of the concern.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Retailers, as well as manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are marketable and harmless to health.
If eggs exceed the maximum residue content of 0.005mg / kg, they are not transportable.
Uncontaminated eggs, however, can be sold and consumed.
This time, businesses are not to blame.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, the production plants are not directly to blame.
Rather, they face economic damage as a result of alleged illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there are too few controllers in the event of an emergency.
Is there only a lack of staff or coherent competence?
It was precisely the official controls that revealed the process.
But the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 per cent ruled out.
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent investigation of such events and the handover to prosecutors in cases where crimes can be committed are of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to provide complete information.
Is regular alarm about food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and marketable food.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The adulterated means have put manufacturers, traders and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the unlawful use of the insecticide fipronil in the keeping of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the facts quickly and completely.
How football's financial rules affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules, which aim to prevent unfettered spending by European football clubs, will not disrupt Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, because the senior organisation that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial Fair Play rules, launched by UEFA in 2011, mean PSG will eventually have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was funded without major losses.
Barcelona have paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money loose for Neymar to sign and take him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on acquiring players but have to counteract with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them the break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed clubs who had taken on huge debts in their pursuit of success were effectively cheating and risked ruining themselves if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on the clubs' debt to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used at Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the squad and build a global brand - should become a tougher affair.
Clubs can take losses of 30 million euros during the current three-year FFP investment period, which runs until 2018.
And although Platini fell into disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin remains committed to deterring from excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," Andrea Traverso, who is in charge of FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar's buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so the transfer fee for the next five years of €44.4 million can be reported in the annual accounts.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit PSG with the heaviest sanctions, along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City.
PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then $82 million), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that team members remain limited to 21 players for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial oversight by inflating their revenue through companies linked to a club's owners.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG if the value of the sponsorship were to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not let this be considered a legitimate income.
That is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of PSG's payments to Neymar could come via payments from the organising committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar in 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver could be easy for UEFA regulators to find out.
The sanctions against PSG so far mean UEFA will be even more attentive to heeding any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preliminary talks with PSG over Neymar's transfer, the people familiar with the situation said on Thursday.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015 / 16 with sales of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be released.
PSG expect Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club expects sales to rise by at least 30 per cent after signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go, and it tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar's eventual ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state funding a club.
"It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as a country owns an association, everything is possible.
It's going to be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country. "
The Turkish community of Germany reacted calmly: It recalled the victims of racist violence with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate over the weekend.
The urban tender for the 16 gates reopens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
No doubt a gate points to the concept of a park.
Either that is the case, or someone is planning to put gates on the land.
Collserola is more complex,"says the architect, for whom the title" Gates of Collserola "contains a" lexical trap ": One must not think of it" as access to a park, but as a delimitation of areas where action must be taken."
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate next to it.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, lamented "the success" of giving "hope" to "marginalized" people "who are always in front of closed doors" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opens its gates, infected by the spirit of solidarity."
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has made board chocolate for the Swiss.
Now the sweet collaboration faces a possible end: The airline is rewriting the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott, at the request of the sda news agency, confirmed a corresponding report by the newspaper "Northwest Switzerland" on Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be inspected every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very pleased with current supplier Chocolat Frey," the spokeswoman said.
Around 17 million small red-white-wrapped shock boards weighing 14 grams distribute the flight attendants to passengers each year before landing.
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwest Switzerland" at 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs.
But more important is the advertising effect: For a chocolate manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there are in the new call for tenders.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to seek a renewal of the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
For sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for comment.
Swiss has been distributing chocolate plates on board its flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
The opportunity to place the logo was introduced by Swiss two and a half years ago with the launch of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers are pampered with treats from Confiserie Sprüngli, in Business Class niche passengers Schoggi from Lindt and in Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi from Chocolat Frey also distributes on the short haul, both in Business and Economy Class.
Energy policy cannot, however, be judged solely from an environmental point of view, since not a single power station - of whatever kind - would soon be built, and stone, clay and earth processing plants and all chemical industrial plants would also have to be examined for the acceptance conditions of their waste by the population and - to quote Mrs Weber once again - they would probably have to wait very long, if not in vain, for acceptance.
In addition to clay and glass, metals, cardboard and plastics are now used as raw materials for their production.
This should be done in the best possible way.
And the best tone is under the House of Commons.
I have not yet heard any Conservatives say that we should store the waste in the best clay under the Thames.

According to PRINZ / 15 /, binding soil types always consist of a mixture of clay and slip fractions with very different proportions of coarser grain fractions.
Under the same climatic conditions, the content of organic substances in clay is higher than in silt or clay.
Clay, in particular, but also clay, are installed as natural materials in layers with predominantly static compaction at the landfill base.
The sealing of landfills with such clay sand mixtures is extremely economical and well controllable.
The secondary material (clay) sealing layer of variant 2 consists exclusively of natural materials.
This base layer is recommended to be made from recondensed natural materials (usually clay) rather than from upcoming, Insitu condensed soils.
Some methods are offered by the EPO to calculate the thickness of the natural material (clay) layer.
The newly created draft directive points out that for this system variant the previous legal requirements (60 cm of condensed clay with a k _ value of 1 Ω 109 m / s) are no longer sufficient.
In the narrow-wall process, the compaction of the substrate is achieved according to the respective geological conditions either by filling or pressing sealing compounds (clay cement and bentonite cement mixtures).
The gradient i of the wall area is calculated from the water level difference and the thickness of the sealing wall, while the gradient i for the sealing horizon (clay, silt) is determined from the water level difference and the binding depth of the trough wall.
The sound acts as a semi-permeable membrane.

Since 1965, the German company Eisenhütte Westfalia-Lünen has been building small propulsion machines of the type mole, fox and badger, mainly in soft rock (clay, plaster, pyrite).
100 g of soil (fertile, non-sterile soil) is suspended in 1 000 ml of chlorine-free drinking water (soil types with a very high content of clay, sand and organic carbon are unsuitable).
The results of the studies carried out under the PAGIS project were published in a five-volume edition: A summary (EUR 11775EN), clay (EUR 11776EN), granite (EUR 11777FR), salt (EUR 11778EN) and undersea sediments (EUR 11779EN).
Clay, this malleable material that our ancestors used for a variety of purposes and which is now used in areas as diverse as construction or the pharmaceutical industry, has attracted the attention of scientists and technicians through its physical and chemical properties, who have the task of developing a safe and reliable system for the disposal of nuclear waste by burying it in deep layers of rock.
The skin chemical component of the clay is an aluminum silicate, which is a refractory material, so that the clay is not a good heat conductor.

The target formation, the so-called boom sound, is found in the underground of the site and has a thickness of more than 100 m. It reaches so deep that a warehouse could be set up at a depth of more than 200 m below the surface.
The boom tone has some very attractive features, such as lithological homogeneity, very low permeability and excellent retention.
Under the boom tone, you can see a succession of shifting layers of sand and clay.
At the Mol site and in its immediate vicinity, the layer of sand under the boom clay is not used for pumping groundwater due to the high content of dissolved substances and low yield.

Inactive materials such as clay, possibly mixed with polymers, pulverized fly ash or asphalt concrete, but also geotextile films such as synthetic material made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or high-density polyethylene (HDPE) are increasingly used.
When the landfill is closed, a final cover of about 1 m is applied from clay and arable crumb.
The last 50 cm of the shaft are sealed with an impermeable material of concrete, bentonite or clay in order to prevent the flow of air and the escape of the collected landfill gas into the atmosphere on the one hand.
Components of the side-rock: Calcareous clay, gray and black clay, limestone, compact gray marl.
Since the addition of sulphuric acid and mixing with clay did not produce any conclusive results, the possibility of mixing unsolved lime and, if necessary, a puzzolanic reaction agent was examined.

Nostalgia goes into the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the glory days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s grunge era (when the pre-thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter shot the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (it included an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By stiffening to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors playing horny kids growing up - they still managed the impossibility of winning back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later," with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody goes more along the watering can principle, including a riff on the Stalker films of the 90s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand That Rocks the Cradle").
At one point, a character rumbles through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The amiable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn't forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
And there's another crazy-vicious plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now backed by George H. W. Bush (a well-done impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It's especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd showing off Matt Dillon's underlip beard of "Singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like an old knacker.
It's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" Series until he reaches what I take as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the gang how they will attend the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, recalls a different kind of nostalgia: The Cold War revival of "The Americans," the movie "Atomic Blonde," and even "Glow" with its east-versus-west wrestling iconography.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, the comedy starring Rhys Thomas as director claims to be a found TV series: A 1980s Romanian drama starring the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The lead roles - a hard-nosed Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues are dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's an ingenious idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of 'Find the Voice Out'.
But "comrade Detective" is so committed to the veracity of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is included - that it often plays like a single one.
With six long episodes, it drags on, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective," edited to a lesser length, might better deliver his agitprop satire, as Gregor and Iosef keep visiting the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men devouring a bunch of hamburgers.

Blow to drug mafia in the country
Police have managed a blow to the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Baar district, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, the prosecutor's office told Konstanz on Friday.
15 defendants, aged between 25 and 77, have been arrested and arrest warrants have already been issued against them.
Officials also secured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people have been arrested in simultaneous raids in Italy.
German arrest warrants were issued against the two suspects Italians.
The two are therefore presumably extradited to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In total, more than 300 police officers were on duty.
The members of the Mafia are accused of organised drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder and robbery and extortion.
Since the summer of 2016, the Prosecutor's Office has been investigating Konstanz against organised drug trafficking in southern Germany.
There was a lively exchange between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
As a result, the large-scale operation on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
The investigations targeted mainly Italian nationals with close links to the Italian mafia.
An incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, in which several shots were fired into an eatery early in the morning, is also likely to go into the gang's account.
Weise laments big gaps in foreigners' register
"Data from citizens who should not show up": According to a report, the foreigners register in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious misdecisions in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government's refugee management officer, Frank-Jürgen Weise, drew attention to large gaps in the Aliens Central Register.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to "partly serious misdecisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, Weise warned in an analysis available to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung."
According to the data, the register covers ten million people with foreign nationality, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is therefore managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality had not been good in parts so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 had been found "by people who are no longer alive, or by citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register."
"Faulty data input can significantly slow return processes," the report continued.
The statistics on people who have to leave also cover EU citizens who do not have to leave at all.
Such false assignments, however,"led to a distorted debate about how to deal with expatriates," according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the federal government has apparently begun sending refugee families with under 16-year-old children back to Italy when they entered from there.
This is clear from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung."
According to the paper, the BAMF has been carrying out such procedures "concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and toddlers - to Italy again since 1 June 2017."

The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weakening inflation dampened speculation of a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it kept interest rates on family incomes in the midst of intensifying pressure.
Policymakers on the Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members seeking a rise this month as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the squeeze on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the autumn.
But she signalled that interest rate hikes would become necessary over the next few years to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation and she said borrowing costs may have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will call for time for the funding plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February, although it has been said it is now expected to provide £15 billion more under this scheme - at £115 billion sterling.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term as the squeeze on household real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."
On interest rates, she reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and a "slightly larger" scale than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "gradual" and "limited."
The Bank's downwardly revised growth forecasts for this year and next are up from the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after that news.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and fell 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision to make no change comes after recent disappointing growth figures dampened rising expectations of a rate hike and GDP rose to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is expected to recover slightly towards the end of the year, according to the bank.
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households hit by rising inflation and minor pay rises, as the tightening gets worse first before it will then improve.
It added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" the slump in income over the next few years, but it added that wages will recover "significantly" at the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also boosted by rising demand for British goods, due to the weak pound, which will offset some of lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after interest rates were cut to 0.25% last August after the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that it will likely take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy.
Before the Bank's latest ruling on interest rates, the call for a rate hike had risen as inflation ratcheted up pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for a rise to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the bank said this was expected and it will rebound in the coming months.
The bank said the overshoot relative to its 2% target was "entirely" attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as lenders are clamouring for deals and looking to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those where existing deals expire and take out the new mortgages, and many with fee-free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular. "
NHS (The National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
Patients will have access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight in the High Court against funding for the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken before intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 per cent, is now being delivered by the health service via an initial three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to fund the process after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should fund it.
The move announced on Thursday was hailed as an "important new intervention" by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a "pivotal moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to sign up, and more clinics will follow in October before it will be rolled out across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in people at risk of infection.
Taking prep before intercourse means there are just enough drugs in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and those with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree with the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also sign up for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The scheme will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is targeted, absorbed and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: "This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of sustained progress in tackling one of humanity's greatest health challenges."
Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
Prep, when targeted at needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access to this NHS-funded trial in England to develop a new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind.
Now that PrEP test medicine has been procured, we're on track to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people. "
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible across the country to protect people infected with HIV and that it will help us move one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society. "
Living the big life: Mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a lavish home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, downsized from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It sits on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's proof of the new design that Joanne hasn't packed and sold her bags.
"Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger room," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this flat in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I've fallen in love with her and made an offer that day. "
Since the first visit, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, a lot of light.
That was my requirement,"she says.
To that end, she hired architecture and design studio Duck & Shed from Notting Hill's Erfan Azadi to use the 12.5-foot-high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the default.
"The steelworks are quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without us having to bend over.
It wasn't just about building a simple platform, but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function up or down. "
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height on top of each other - with plenty of added drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.
At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all Joanne's cutlery and glasses.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can shut down the kitchen if it is not used.
Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.
What's special about this one is that it's a garage door.
"A little bit of engineering went in there," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so when you push the door up, it glides very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an extra 16 sq m, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you're going to sell the floor space - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will step in and do a calculation based on the floor size."
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space while using high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things that touch you and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electric sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart. "
It shows that with good design and increased square metres, an apartment can transform from something standard into something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you might choose not to leave this one.
An architectural history with heights, depths and happy end: The Austrian world exhibition pavilion of Brussels in 1958 won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and disgraced.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the favoured one, which was home to all the incidences and had received all the prizes beforehand (gastronomy competition Easter, audience vote on the best handmade costume and Reina Madre), had "made the other female candidates jealous, stressing the Queen, who therefore couldn't shine on stage."
Ariel Osorio, a journalist on the "Como en casa" programme at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition does not, after all, become queen."

Brothers fight over $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers are in a dispute over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court to have their property and business assets divided.
Paul had wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but a sharp row over the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Along with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
That money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis' portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as shopping centres in the suburb.
Under an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third.
A court filing says this means Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.
The division of property and cash has proved a problem point for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought were the best objects," he wrote in an initial affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, the first Supreme Court hearing was held after several failed mediations.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, has ruled him out.
Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some possessions.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Costs are rising in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Ms De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school, when Paul was still a young child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property amicably to their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis business group, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
Both Luke and Mark, Paul says,"have become embittered about the terms of their financial separation."
Colin has held back a lot despite being a former AFL board member and being the TV star's best friend, according to a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers for comment.
Only Colin replied by text message to say "I really can't say much" because the case is before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he was "still hoping for a solution."
On Friday, that hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.

The UNDP helped countries address these challenges at global, national and community level by identifying and passing on best practices, providing innovative policy advice and bringing together partners through pilot projects that enable poor people to build sustainable livelihoods.
The independence of the AIAD was also deemed necessary to provide impartial advice to the management level and to provide performance assessments of programme managers.
In addition to the support of the Secretary-General and the Peacebuilding Commission, the Office could also, upon request, provide advice and assistance to the heads of peacekeeping missions, resident United Nations coordinators or individual governments, for example in the development of strategies for political transition arrangements or in the establishment of new state institutions.
(A) monitor policy developments related to implementation and provide advice and good services as needed;

The Council should also have the conditions to provide technical assistance to states and to provide policy advice to states and United Nations bodies.
Members of the United Nations should be able to seek advice from the Peacebuilding Commission at any stage and request assistance from a Permanent Fund for Peacebuilding.
This would make it possible to coordinate internal legal expertise and provide expert advice, both inside and outside the United Nations, on the conformity of national legislation and practices with international obligations in the field of human rights, with the demand for such expert advice likely to increase through greater interaction of the Office with the countries.
The OHCHR can benefit from the support, analysis and expertise of civil society and, in turn, provide support, training and advice for contact with United Nations bodies.
At the international level, some civil society organisations can help establish or mobilise global partnerships on specific issues or draw attention to the plight of indigenous peoples and other fringe groups, while others pass on best practices to other countries by sharing experiences between communities and providing technical support and advice to governments.
I believe that such a body should not carry out early warning or monitoring functions, but it would be useful if the Member States could at any time consult the Council of the Commission for Peace Consolidation and request assistance from a permanent fund for peace consolidation in order to strengthen their national institutions for conflict reduction, notably by strengthening the institutions of the rule of law.
The AIAD investigators also give informal advice to the special agencies.
We approve the creation of a first operational capability for a permanent police capacity to provide a coherent, effective and responsive initial capacity for the police component of the United Nations peacekeeping missions and to assist existing missions with advice and expertise.
5. recommends that the United Nations continue to provide technical advice and other assistance to the requesting States and electoral institutions during the entire duration of the electoral process, including as necessary before and after the elections, on the basis of the results of needs assessment missions, in order to contribute to the strengthening of their democratic processes;

Legal basis: Article 103 of the EEC Treaty, basic Regulation 974 / 71 ZIELE: Avoiding short-term distortions of trade flows, to which the difference between the market rate and the agricultural conversion rate or "green" rate expressed in ECU would result in some Member States.
- for Member States whose currency is higher than the ECU equivalent calculated on the basis of the agricultural conversion rate (green rate) applied under the common agricultural policy, monetary compensatory amounts are levied on imports and granted on exports (positive WAB);
To this end, the WAB will no longer be calculated according to the difference between the green rate and the central rate, but according to the difference between the green rate and the "central rate multiplied by a correction factor."
For 100 000 people, each receiving DM 4,500, of which 50% from the ESF, an amount of DM 225 million or ECU 120 million (rate 1:1) would have to be earmarked annually.
On 8.10.1990, sterling joined the exchange rate mechanism; its ECU central rate is 0.696904, slightly different from the previous fictitious rate.
It is precisely this drain that has helped push the value of the yen below the rate that might otherwise have been expected.
Whether temporary foreign exchange funds, a supported rate for certain amounts or much else, economic experts must help here, but quickly and without long and time-consuming audits.
The second value is the current conversion rate, or "green rate," which allows common agricultural prices to be converted into national prices.
Since the price of the new euro may be unstable, particularly in the early stages, this may also lead to large fluctuations in world market prices for agricultural products, if they are converted into the euro.
Does the Commission consider that the principle of equal treatment under company law, inter alia within the meaning of Article 42 of the EC's second AGDirective, is respected if the Danish State can undertake the compulsory confiscation of shares of private shareholders of Teledanmark at a price of 125 and resell these shares of Teledanmark at a price of 4,700 to Ameritech USA?
We know that the euro is losing value, the rate is too high.

The Community shall reimburse the amount referred to in paragraph 1 at the rate of the ECU applicable on 1 May 1996 (1 ECU - 6,44527 ffrs).
The financing plans of the Community Support Frameworks and the Community intervention amounts are expressed in ecu, at the rate set out in this decision. Payments will be transferred to the following account:
The financing plans of the Community Support Frameworks and the amounts of Community aid payments are expressed in ecu, at the rate set out in this decision.
(1) The agricultural conversion rate applicable to the compensatory amounts is the rate applicable on the first day of the month on which the products are actually taken over by:
(2) In the case of Guayana, the agricultural conversion rate applicable to the compensatory amounts is the rate applicable on the first day of the month on which the products are shipped.
If the amounts to be paid in the individual currencies are fixed in relation to another currency, the conversion takes place at the rate stated in the order.
For the other currencies, there was no gap between the green rate and the market rate (including correction factor).
The conversion takes place after the price, which applies 30 days before the last date for the submission of the offer.
The financing plans of the Community support frameworks are expressed in ecu, at the rate set out in this decision.
(3) The Commission's financial contribution shall be paid in ecu at the rate applicable on the first working day of the month in which the application for reimbursement published in the Official Journal of the European Communities was made.
Tax law, on the other hand, introduced procedures relating to the deductibility of exchange rate differences resulting from the conversion of monetary foreign currency items if the cut-off date rate differs from the rate at which they would be booked or were included in previous annual accounts (Article 72 of the Income (Tax) Act 917 / 1986).
Income and expenses are converted to the rate that was valid on the day of the business incident; in practice, an average rate is usually applied.
If the business is settled at a contractually agreed rate, this rate is to be used.
This means in particular that monetary foreign currency items are converted to the cut-off date, unless a "hedging" rate is used in accordance with paragraph 48.
Consequently, the results of the financial year are always reported at the rate applicable on the balance sheet date.
In most cases, the receivables and / or liabilities expressed in foreign currency were converted at the rate prevailing on the day they were booked, without taking into account unrealized gains on the balance sheet date, but the corresponding conversion losses were well reported.
This course is to be indicated in the annex."

The buildings in Brussels acquired before 1981 were recorded after conversion to the ECU rate of January 1981.
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are recognised at their initial acquisition value, converted into ecu at the rate applicable at the time of purchase.
The annual budget estimates for the expenditure referred to in Article 4 are based on the average market parity during the first three months of the previous year.

Between September 1992 and March 1995, the rate of the peseta in the EMS was adjusted four times (17.9.92, 22.11.92, 13.5.93 and 6.3.95), and in total it was devalued by 26% within two and a half years.
Since then, the ECU has also been replaced by the euro at the rate of 1:1.
The quoted exchange rate is the rate applicable at the end of the reporting period.
Three aspects of producer prices are particularly important, namely their development over time at Community level (using an index to combine the real prices for individual types of products), the development of prices in the Member States and the resulting differences (absolute prices in nominal ECU at the market rate) and the relationship between producer prices and institutional prices (for some selected Member States in nominal national currency).

For much of the month of July, the dollar remained under pressure, with the dollar-yen rate hitting record lows.
The development of the Finnmark exchange rate, on the other hand, was reversed because, while the Finnish currency had risen between March and November 1995, it subsequently declined and at the end of March 1996, at 3.14 FMK for 1 DM, it was about the same magnitude as at the end of March 1995.
At the end of November, the rate of the Irish pound against the DM improved to 2.586, the best level since the reduction of the central rate in February 1993.
On the last day of 1996, the D-mark rate of sterling was as high as it had been for more than four years, and the Irish pound's rate against the D Mark reached its highest level since the Irish currency in February 1993 within the EMS Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM).

Trump's new chief of staff plans to curtail the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even course.
Here's a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with senior executives on his first day at work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he wants to fix: Bad information that gets into the president's hands.
Kelly told staff that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information. "
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by overseeing his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his television advertising is still going strong.
"If candidate Trump was upset because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from outlets to convince," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady burst of praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know to others - that Trump's tweets would have contained even more ignition without their interventions.
We will probably never learn anything about the tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his staff managed to keep trouble away from him a few times, then their efforts paid off.
But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House made up of competing parties keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump with material that may be promoting their views of the world.
Politico - entirely preoccupied with this story - reported in May on the advisers' penchant for providing dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press clippings, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he's bracing himself to find out where these come from.
That's exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a bunch of leaks" at the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has made false allegations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began questioning staff about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives."
How did that work out?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still seeking influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.

Historically, home prices have developed enormous momentum and prices in the aforementioned cities are still rising rapidly, although this increase is already a little slower than a year or more ago.
Based on high growth trends, it seems certain that prices in most of these cities will rise significantly over another year or longer, even if the rate of increase continues to decline.
Prices in glamour cities are likely to fall sharply in the next serious recession, or in the event of a shock to the local economy, as well as interest rates rising too rapidly.
In this case, contagion within and across markets could set in motion a downward spiral and lower prices for years.
Travellers negotiate a ditch and return to 'millionaire row"
Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are back on war footing with some determined travellers who have negotiated a community-drawn ditch to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside an affluent Solihull street called the "millionaire row."
They have brought horses, babies and an army of vans after they were only thrown out in May, but without having been deterred by a ditch excavated by the council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defences and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unobstructed to find a way.
Angry residents have berated Solihull council, which said it was "useless to deal with the problem."
An anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday night after being sent on by Bentley Heath where they threw stones at passersby.
The Council must be forced into action by shame, because it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably more today. "
She added: "Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by holding long instruction sessions to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue to pay my community tax if the council can't even stop that. "
One resident, who did not want to be named, said: 'It's ridiculous, we've only just seen the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you've even seen a horse in the park area. "
A Solihull Council spokeswoman said: "We are aware of an unauthorised camp on the land beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihulls Police, taking the necessary legal action to allow them to move on as soon as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many local residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps create a picture of the situation where the court will have to consider when we present our case. "
Together with his colleague and co-accused, he then decided to take on this task.

From Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
From the former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and is due to reopen on March 1 next year.
This is good news for the city.
With the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost at the time, as well as income from the visitor's tax.
In the fall of 2014, in the face of dramatically rising numbers of refugees coming to the county, the hotel building was offered to the county council office as collection accommodation, prompting controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not without controversy in the local council at the time.
But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke already then of serious interested parties in the house.
He should be right.
The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to turn it back into a three-star plus category house under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, construction waste containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovations are being carried out.
The floors were ripped out, blankets partly dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still a lot of work to be done by March.
"It's actually a beautiful hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms will be equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area will be redesigned, new windows will be installed.
Everything should later become "pretty close to the citizen," as Thomas Scherer puts it.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it."
Facilities include a swimming pool, spa and a meeting room.
One does not want to position oneself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an upscale downtown level, emphasizes Scherer.
The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set itself up wide, explains Scherer.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The ideas of the city are identical with those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
Asked about the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to be specific.
Just under a million euros, he reckons.
The outdoor installations are also brought to the front man, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard there is a large terrace, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is open to the public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."
It's not an easy task, but it needs to be done now and there's no way around it anymore.
The "much more important task" looms on Sunday.
Not a single accident is the same and calculating the cost of the parts and working hours can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The basic models usually only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
The joke of the matter is that the firm presents itself to the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.

"In these places, a desk with trained staff is also available to travellers, advising interested parties on internet buying and also putting the coupon on the map," says project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
A passenger who does not travel on suburban buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupon ends can in turn go to the self-service vending machines, where the coupons are put on the card.
The new elections are over, and now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debates on public television, the party chiefs barely let their cards peek.
Russia affair: Us special investigator sets up Grand Jury
In the Russia affair involving US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have set up a so-called grand jury, according to a report.
The panel had begun work in recent weeks, the "Wall Street Journal" wrote, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper assessed the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.
The broadcaster CNN reported there were already initial subpoenas from the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of purposefully interfering in the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there was collusion between Trump's campaign team and Moscow in the process.
The focus of the investigation is said to be several men who acted as advisers to the Republican in the campaign.
Mueller also reportedly took more and more of Trump's private and business environment under scrutiny.
The "Washington Post" wrote several weeks ago that the special investigator had personally put Trump at the center and was investigating the allegation of whether the president may have obstructed justice as the affair unfolded.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine existing evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to bring charges.
Grand juries are therefore also called chambers of indictment.
For the most part, they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always behind closed doors.
The panel can also be called in by the Public Prosecutor's Office to invite people to be interrogated under oath.
Subpoenas have already been issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer, according to broadcaster CNN.
People involved in the meeting had been asked to testify, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as his then-campaign chief Paul Manafort, were also present at the conversation.
Legal experts said Thursday evening on US television that the deployment showed that Mueller did not allow himself to be intimidated in his work and that, if necessary, he wanted to act quickly.
But it did not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury would be called in at the end to decide whether to bring an indictment.
Still, the establishment of the panel is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
Amid the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to portray the Russia affair as a campaign by his political opponents.
"The Russia story is a total fabrication," Trump said.
The issue gives Democrats a way to "feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about."
His special counsel, Ty Cobb, said in a statement that he knew nothing of the establishment of a grand jury.
However, he emphasized that he also usually works in secret.
The White House is in favor of any action that accelerated the special investigator's work in a "fair" way.
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that no investigation is under way against the president.
There was no reason to assume that anything had changed, the statement continued.
Mueller, though, had only been deployed after Trump fired Comey.
Allegations against Trump that he wanted to obstruct justice had been raised because of that ejection.
Comey testified before a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to halt the investigation into then-national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under a lot of pressure because of the investigation.
After portraying US media, the White House gathered material against the special investigator and his associates.
That sparked speculation about whether Trump wanted to fire Mueller.
Unlike an independent special congressional investigator, such as in the Watergate affair involving the later resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Justice Department at the president's urging.
However, several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators on Thursday unveiled bills under which the special investigator could no longer be so easily dismissed.
Antarctica: Gigantic iceberg drives in Antarctica
In West Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg of almost seven times the size of Berlin has detached from the ice shelf.
The Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research announced this on Wednesday.
The colossus, weighing more than a trillion tonnes and 5800 square kilometres, is now heading north and will probably take two or three years to melt.
With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.
A danger to people does not come from him.
The extent to which climate change played a role in the iceberg's demolition is unclear, according to researchers.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region for around 30 years, the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now aborted colossus was previously a part of the Larsen C ice shelf.
Ice shelf floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It grows further and further into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen C ice shelf is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this ice shelf, the balance of growth and breakdown was disrupted a few years ago.
A complete ice shelf had disintegrated there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is some evidence that the Larsen C ice shelf is also in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it is at present.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can disintegrate if a piece breaks off at a key point.
Melting ice cream and iceberg doesn't raise sea levels as they swim on the water, displacing ice as much water as it yields after melting itself.
However, the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and drain much faster than before.
That could potentially raise sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the British Antarctic Observation Research Project (Midas).
The Larsen C ice shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica, with nearly 50,000 square kilometres, according to AWI data.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks down regularly.
"While it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now coming into a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary of Britain's Swansea University.
"This is the furthest retreat since records began," he, too, confirmed.
Among scientists, it is controversial whether the Larsen C shelf ice will now grow again or decline in the long term and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Even if these researchers do not attribute the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many ice shelves in the Antarctic Peninsula have disintegrated in recent decades.
This long tip of Antarctica stretches toward South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Antarctic Peninsula's ice surface has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The increase in temperature had contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by around three degrees over the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where the temperature is rising at the fastest rate.

The agency reported, according to a police affidavit statement, Frazetta Junior claimed he was instructed by his father "that he should enter the museum by all means necessary to bring all the paintings to a warehouse."
CDU wants house tariff on staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU is calling for retiring from the employers' association to become more attractive.
Just before the summer recess, County Day waved through 41 new posts in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now another 17 apprentices have completed their first day of work.
The apprenticeships at the circle are apparently very much sought after.
Around 620 applications were registered for the places to be awarded this year.
However, the circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
Currently, there are still 50 unfilled vacancies in Mettmann County.
Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are being sought.
The CDU, together with the FDP and the UWG, now wants to take the initiative in the District Day and address the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
The administration is to "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development" at the request of the parties.
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of skilled workers, but to counteract the shortages of applicants in the future, it says.
The overall concept should be oriented inwards and outwards, show concrete measures for beginners and include a training offensive, demand the CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know before.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
There is talk of a genuine "competition of public employers."
In addition, there is a high number of employees who retire from the service due to illness or age.
It is high time for action, therefore, so that more jobs do not remain unfilled.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU group, goes beyond the joint motion with his party.
He caused a lousy surprise in the District Day recently when he publicly questioned the staffing cost cap and stunned the other parties.
Völker wants all options for leaving the local employers' association to be reviewed.
"If we do not reach a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration should seek a house tariff with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county towns," Völker said.
In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than the Public Service Tariff Regulation actually provides for.
Salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money only exist if you move to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up where employees would take care of the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection Act.
Not least because of the rising number of asylum seekers, county councillor Thomas Hendele and county director Martin Richter have a problem: They have too few staff.
On the other hand, those same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more heavily for the Republican side to use the cards issued by those clubs for elections.

"The dedication, discipline and motivation of Earthwatch researchers are a real source of inspiration for us," says Volunteer Birgit Frankenberg, Business & Project Management at Credit Suisse Deutschland from Frankfurt.
Since December 2013, the Roger Federer Foundation has massively increased its use with the inclusion of satellite hoards.
"Dedication, nobility, tolerance, respect, kindness."
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and regional powers "make this situation insoluble."
Italy tightens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs using rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they must not continue to do so unless they abide by new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs don't sign a new code of conduct, it's difficult to see how they can continue to work," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a boat belonging to the German aid organization 'Jugend Rettet' because its team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The charity, which has only been in operation for a year, declined to comment on detailed allegations made by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We can't assess all the allegations currently being made until we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."
Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat from 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that his crew will board inflatable migrants, delivered to them directly by traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart so the ships can be used again.
At least one such gathering reportedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of flouting the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives.
Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must, above all, have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be seen as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve "significant changes or obstructions" to their bailouts.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti meanwhile said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue efforts had fallen sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and work with local mayors had come to fruition.
"In the last few days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of being able to reach Europe.
A modest home market compared to global sales.
The Central and Eastern European countries have gained in importance for Switzerland since their accession to the EU, both as production sites and as sales and procurement markets.
When the price of oil hit the $US150 per barrel mark, sales in the US were already shifting in favor of more economical models.
At BMW, the growth rates in sales for the first six months of the year were even 100 percent.
We also have this experience when investing in the sales of road cars.
And he adds that providing information about a company's philanthropic activities is just as important as communicating sales or competitor information at board meetings.
Sales at TrueView-Ads, i.e. advertising clips that are either played before a video starts or displayed as display advertising next to it, also rose 45 percent last year.
The trained industrial engineer (Berchten) and the robotics specialist (Guernier) are convinced that their product will be sold, and expect 80 000 to 100 000 airbags sold each year for the future.
Sales of computers, printers, servers and additional storage capacity will fall short of software and services for now, but will catch up over time and perhaps even drive up yields in the fiercely competitive PC market.
After a decline of 10 percent over the previous year in the first quarter of 2013, PC sales to companies in the second quarter were roughly at the same level in the quarterly comparison, which suggests a stabilization of sales figures.
Climbs and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy four days of trials and sights.
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michael Chapel above Deidesheim.
It was followed by vantage points, partly on towers, from which one could look far over the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains.
In between there were always longer climbs, for which long trials rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, vantage point lined up at vantage point, connected by "fleeting" trials and moderate climbs.
On the last two days many meters of altitude were announced again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and resting huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed healing brine in the open-air inhalatory.
Neustadt was also controlled.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude, the group had come to know the Palatinate Forest at its best - sporty and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga gears up for e-sports
Are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future instead of sweating their way across the stadium turf in the wind and weather?
The fact is: E-sports has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gages included.
The first Bundesliga clubs to become increasingly involved in this area have also recognised this.
The VfL Wolfsburg made the start in 2015, later followed by FC Schalke 04 and most recently VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and contracted two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope this will inspire completely new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure that "there are still quite a few clubs on this train."
Next weekend, the FIFA World Cup in London organises the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in which the gamers of different clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven, for example, have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The ex-coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen, meanwhile, is advising an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, that the young people are still going to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-athletes under contract, you could be present in these markets online far more often than just sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year.
What exactly is it all about?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the football simulation FIFA are fought at the competition level.
As in normal sport, leagues have long since been established in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, e-sports is already part of the official program.
But is it a proper sport at all?
For many, the idea certainly needs getting used to.
Ingo Froböse, too, has long grappled with the question.
For the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne, e-sports is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also needed cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and rapid responsiveness.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console but also their bodies and pay attention to the diet.
"The fitter player is a good player."
But Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more of an issue."
Controls were difficult to implement in online games, and the scene lacked the structures of classical sport.
On a positive note, the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sports.
The players are travelling internationally, this is like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers there.
A study by business consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (Biu) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million euros had been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, sales are projected to be 130 million.
Against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Football League, that is little.
However, e-sports are "no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte consultants write.
Internationally, many countries have already moved on.
Major markets are Asia and the US, where ex-basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez are joining US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in eSport betting provider Unikrn
Europe is also doing a lot.
At a Norwegian school, e-sports had been introduced as a teaching subject, Froböse says.
In the Netherlands and France, first-league football clubs are now required to set up an e-sports department, according to Dutt.
"In European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB board member Röttgermann.
Just falling into nostalgia, and glorifying the old days, is no longer enough today.
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but at the same time to align the company with the modern market.
"We live in a digitized world," says Dutt, too.
"There you can't hold on to the fact that only with football everything stays the way it always was."
Unfortunately, the European system of public art funding is falling victim to slow economic growth and growing budget deficits.
An immediate deployment of an adequate civilian and security presence during the months immediately after the 1999 NATO bombing campaign might have created appropriate safeguards against the backlash that turned victims into perpetrators.
One of these projects is to provide medical information to developing countries via the Internet, another is to provide communication equipment and experts for use in emergencies and humanitarian emergencies, and a third is to provide significantly more children worldwide with vaccination protection.
However, access to resources is only part of the problem, and I would like to reiterate the importance of denouncing the manufacture, distribution and use of these indiscriminate weapons.
The Forum, which successfully concluded its fourth meeting in February 2000, deals in particular with forest issues from the point of view of sustainable forest management, addressing not only the underlying causes of deforestation, but also the trade in forest products and the use of market-based forest management instruments.

Poison eggs ade - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking
Almost all federal states have now been affected by the poison-laden eggs scandal.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have responded by removing all eggs from sale across Germany.
Only eggs that have been shown to contain no fipronil are to be taken to the shelves.
In this performance very balanced encounter, Marcus Blasutto's TSV team, however, consistently matched the great physical commitment and a pleasing commitment of both teams.
The Council is currently examining the extent to which these mechanisms are included in Article 7.
So we ask the rapporteur, the Commission and the Council to supplement the agricultural policy part with the fisheries policy part, for example by making "agricultural and fisheries policy aspects of enlargement" from the title "agricultural policy aspects of enlargement."
I would particularly like to address the Council, which is unfortunately essentially absent, but which has some expectations and concerns.
The compound feed industry has already tried again to influence the Council and to overturn the open declaration.
I would like to point out to the honourable Members that the Council working group has unanimously decided to recommend to the Council that a joint committee be set up in the action programme to increase the influence of the individual Member States through a combination of management and advisory procedures.
In our view, the report contains a disagreement on the question, on which my group does not agree, namely whether the establishment of an internal auditor should be required only for the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament, or also for the smaller institutions.
Two examples: The Education Council, in connection with the item on the agenda concerning the mobility of students and teachers, because we have noted a great deal of inequality in mobility, and the Internal Market, Consumption and Tourism Council, in connection with the item on the agenda on the development of electronic commerce, in order to make it accessible to all women and men, because here too, as we know, there is inequality between women and men.
I must therefore admit that this amendment, as the Council and the Commission have said, is not justified in this case, and I would like to take this opportunity once again to remind you that the procedures of import controls in the European Union do not work, that fraud is committed and that these cases of fraud are not only bad for the Community taxpayer, but also bad for the functioning of the internal market and even for fairness towards third countries.
The Commission and the Council will do yours, and that is the most important thing that is currently on the agenda in Yugoslavia; that has always been our interest.
With regard to the Intergovernmental Conference, I believe that the work before Biarritz at ministerial level had already progressed as far as possible, and the informal Council therefore took place at the right time to confirm certain progress in order to provide guidelines for the final phase in which we are now.
Madam President, first of all, I would like to congratulate the European Council for adopting the draft Charter as binding.
Meeting the demands of the large countries for more power in the Council and in Parliament would upset the balance within the European Union and lead to the small countries paying the full price for enlargement.
We must support the efforts of Mr Prodi and Mr Patten to strengthen the Commission's capacity to act through parliamentary insight and the necessary parliamentary scrutiny, which does not refer to the Council and Mr Solana.
Although we share the criticism of the Council on many points, it remains to be said that it would be a politically unmediable confrontation and would undermine credibility in European institutions.
I do not want to give the impression that the Council is not answering the questions put to it.
The Council is actively examining the Commission proposal and the above-mentioned amendments in order to reach an opinion on this issue as soon as possible.
At that time, we did not yet know that the Council and the Commission had promised aid from these funds for reconstruction in Serbia and Kosovo.
Mr President, the Council has really surpassed itself with the draft budget it presented for 2001.
In this respect, and also in view of the Commission's admission that the Member States' demands for payments for the Structural Funds for 2001 exceed the estimates of the PDB by 8 billion, I think it is time for the Council to think very seriously now that we need to do something about the payments and not increase the 'RAL'.
In due course, such a support and signalling effect will also be necessary vis-à-vis the Council.
Several proposals are already before the Council and Parliament, such as the package of proposals to recast and update hygiene rules.
I therefore ask that the Council, which is not here, and the Commission be informed of the importance of increasing this amount, because, unfortunately, between 20 and 50 new mines will be laid for each mine cleared.
The renunciation of the requirement for closer cooperation within the framework of the Treaty, as well as the abolition of the right of veto and the possibility of presenting the issue to the European Council, would be a violation of fundamental principles of European cooperation within the EU.
In October last year, the General Affairs Council approved the first five action plans for Somalia, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Morocco and Iraq.
The committee responsible has followed me in this, and the signals from the Council are also pleasingly positive.
The Council will have to ask itself whether, by granting candidate status to Turkey, it has not done more harm than good to this concern.
The Council adopted a common EU strategy for the Mediterranean at its meeting in Feira in June 2000, and the European Commission, after proposing and implementing the reform of the MEDA Regulation, recently presented a document on the intensification of the Barcelona process.
The Commission and the Council express their readiness to do so.
What diplomatic initiatives does the Council intend to take in order to bring Armenia / Azerbaijan closer together, to resolve their bilateral differences and to promote their cooperation?
Secondly, the Council refers in its response to NATO as Pontius Pilate, without commenting on Turkey's provocative violation of the sovereign rights of Greece, which was expressed this time on the occasion of the NATO manoeuvre.
However, other countries absolutely want the compensation fund, and I must tell you quite frankly that if we were to propose a compulsory introduction of the compensation fund now, the result would be that we could forget the whole thing, because there would never be a majority in the Council for it.
I would like to give an example: As you know, there have been difficulties for the Council in banning the export of products deemed to be unsafe to third countries, while this ban is very important for the European Parliament and we fully support it.
The Garot report aims to improve some aspects of the Commission's proposal by trying to find a compromise solution with the Council, in particular on financial participation in the Fund.
The Council of the European Union, in cooperation with your institution and the European Commission, also plays an active role in updating and constantly reinforcing European rules to prevent and combat this disease.
The Commission and the Council of the European Union have a heavy responsibility for the scale of the mad cow crisis.
Parliament can be proud that the proposal to establish this academy was born here, and we are grateful to the Portuguese Presidency for taking it up, and thank the Commission and the Council for their support.
A declaration on the economic, social and cultural characteristics of sport and its social function in Europe will also be prepared for the European Council.
His voice would be stronger, and the voice of the ministers who defend agriculture in the service of sustainable development would also be much stronger in the Council if it could be based on decisions taken here in the codecision procedure.
As requested by Mr Brok in his report, the Council will have overview documents detailing relations between the Union and the individual partner countries in order to make better use of the Union's overall efforts, to increase their efficiency and to better prepare its debates on external action.
I would also like to say that, within the framework of all the positions taken by the Council, there is no budgetary obligation on the part of the European Union to finance any military activity.
Furthermore, it is completely illogical that only the Council can amend the Financial Regulation, and we repeat our request for conciliation on this point.
On many points, as Mr Watts has already explained, the European Parliament takes a stricter stance than seems to be the case in the Council.
Discussions have also been held with the sectors concerned and there have been numerous contacts with the French Presidency with a view to reaching a consensus text which can be quickly adopted by the two legislative bodies, the Council and the European Parliament.
I would like to say to Mr Jarzembowski that the Council is not seeking a compromise.
"It is clear that there can be an incompetent and provocative official, but if 15 Member States agree to such answers, I believe that you, Madam President, must take the initiative and urge the Council to respect a prerogative of Members of the European Parliament.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that with the debate on proportionality (votes in the Council and seats in Parliament), that is, on the balance of power between the Member States, a pandora nozzle has been opened, which will be difficult to close again in Nice.
The report has been the subject of difficult discussions in the Council.
I have been told by my chairman of the Committee on Budgets that this is the first time that a conciliation agreement has been reached between the Council and Parliament.
Ultimately, it was the weighting of votes in the Council that was most hotly debated and where it was most difficult to come to a decision.
As a representative of the groupings of the European Free Alliance, I would like to warn the Commission, but especially the Council, in the event that the EU does not want to be more than an intergovernmental community.
But the Nice European Council, like many other summits in the history of the European Union, represents a victory of reality, a victory of pragmatism over utopia.
If the Council wanted to do that, it would behave thoughtlessly and unwisely.
Secondly, has the Council been informed by the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights, who is well represented on the ground?
What improvements will the Council make to Directive 92 / 12 / EEC, which is referred to here, so that the responsibilities of the supplier and the recipient are clearly and without the possibility of fraud?
Under Article 23 of the EU Treaty, such a decision will be taken unanimously by the Council, as will all other decisions with defence implications.
Mr President, as the Groupement Européen des Sociétés d'Auteurs et de Compositeurs rightly pointed out, the draft we are discussing here has been attacked in an excessive way in the course of its examination by the Council.
Secondly, this issue will be on the agenda of the Telecommunications Council next Friday.
At the trialogue meeting, it was clear that the Council was not prepared to make concessions on this issue.
The precautionary principle was also discussed at the Nice Summit, which took note of a resolution adopted by the General Affairs Council.
The 2001 budget is largely based on a compromise between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, which we support.
The Nice European Council had a positive aspect: With the decision on a new weighting of votes and a new distribution of MEPs, including the candidate countries of Eastern Europe, it gave them a strong signal of its readiness to accept them as soon as possible.
Michelle Carter convicted over texts urging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentencing behind bars and five years have been suspended on probation.
Carter was convicted in June of negligent homicide of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Speaking at the hearing on Thursday, Roy's father said: 'My family is uncomforted.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was allowed to remain free pending the appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy were suffering from a mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and downward facing eyes as she was sentenced.
"Her actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She has not taken any responsibility,"she said.
"She hasn't shown any remorse."
But Carter's attorney said it was a "terrible circumstance that she totally regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he had not found out that her "age or maturity, or even her mental illness, has a significant impact on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying that there is "not a day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity,"it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the realisation that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"No longer having this only person I've been with every day since I was born is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case appears to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang up, spring from a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention from the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case through any press.
The case has divided legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before she was acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, posted a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."

Joshua kimmich: Learning from FC Bayern's new mini-lame
That Joshua kimmich was allowed to run up as captain in the Audi Cup is no coincidence.
FC Bayern are confident of a big season for the Confed Cup winner - extra motivation doesn't hurt there.
Something was different there on his seat in the cabin, that saw Joshua kimmich immediately, even if the extra garment was very, very small.
But as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer could be seen, he made up his arm with the bandage assigned to him.
"The coach hasn't announced it," the Confed Cup winner recounted afterwards, after his first deployment as Bayern captain.
Well, the score could have been better than the 0-2 against SSC Naples.
But the sign from the coach could also interpret kimmich that way.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been chosen as the game leader in the C-Eleven, made up of youth players, debutants and professionals just out of holiday, but he.
Sugar is best distributed to those whom you trust a lot, whom you want to keep on a whim.
So anyone who has been chosen to take on the legacy of Lahm can only use a little extra motivation well.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: To take responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flitted across the field as a mini lame.
Right back, this is now his position, the white bandage on the arm did the rest.
And at all in this starting formation kimmich looked like the one who can best take the helm.
He gave instructions, tried to direct the unheralded force.
He had the look for the whole thing, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal to overplay his lack of fitness (hardly worked); Renato Sanches to follow up on the achievements of the Asia trip (only partially worked out); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle to not stand out negatively in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
That worked very well.
Süle ran up alongside kimmich, Rudy in front of the defence, both acting sovereign.
The well-known Napoli storm was often difficult, and Süle also tried a few times in the build-up to the game.
While his colleague Rudy admitted the result was "not as we hoped it would be."
But he, too, showed a tidy performance on debut.
Game shift, tempo change: "For this style I was fetched too."
How unusual this Bayern world is for the newcomers was seen after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few crisp statements in the back of his new fellow players.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "What's going on here, I've already noticed.
At Bayern you've just got to win every game. "
After all, he no longer has to teach the new.

Austria's most famous footballer took to Twitter shortly before the game and wished the ÖFB ladies well.
The Bavarian Legionnaire is almost a club colleague of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and fights with our lads.
The tweet from the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner should be a special splash of motivation.
Our ladies might well need the famous Bayern Dusel.
In court, it was revealed that Ditta was a 'regular user' of cocaine after Class A drugs had been discovered in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards during tests.
It was revealed in court that he had called key drug trafficking players, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed them of what investigators knew about them.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
In court, the defendant initially claimed he was suffering from severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died next to him in an explosion.
The court no longer had to hear any of the harmed women.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and also held that the health law's requirement that states either expand access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise eliminate all state Medicaid subsidies was not unconstitutional limiting.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered outside the court to cheer on the new president, and unlike the presidential splendor from the Mubarak era, traffic was stopped only briefly for the car convoy to cross the usually busy road linking the city centre to the southern suburbs.
But by taking the official oath before the court, rather than Parliament as usual, he is bowing to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
What is difficult is that, in court, rockers almost always abide by - and fail to testify - a law that is brazen to them.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate minister: Economy praises Wissing's pace
It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Greens) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new economy minister, Volker Wissing (FDP), is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak of a change in economic policy at T V request - and at the same time rebuke the old minister.
Frank natus, chairman of the Association of Trier Companies (VTU), says: "Wissing picks up on the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked."
The biggest turnaround sees natus in infrastructure policy: The gap on Highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's list of priorities.
Later this year, the ministry hopes for a plan finding process, with construction law due to stand by 2021.
The western bypass of Trier, which is in the urgent need of the federal transport infrastructure plan, also plays a role in the country's plans.
The aim is to get the line up and running in December 2020, says ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a signpost to prop up regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier is seeking a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine, as suggested by Wissing, in order to increase sales in supermarkets and halt the trend of German wine exports, which have been declining for the past decade.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praises the IHK.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new Masters bonus as an additional incentive for young apprentices, says managing director Matthias Schwalbach.
It provides for a premium of 1000 euros for the master's examination and 2500 euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years of the master's training.
The homework list for the country, however, remains long.
According to Jan Glockauer, Chief Executive Officer of the Trier Chamber of Commerce, the country lacks the necessary personnel for the planned road construction.
Out of 56 new engineers Wissing plans to hire at the state company Mobility, only 29 positions have been filled so far.
The IHK is calling for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
CDU Group vice-president Christian Baldauf points to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country is investing more than 20 million euros less in maintaining country roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
Frank natus also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
It is also sobering to note the broadband expansion in the country so far.
In 2016, regional companies had rated network supply at just the 3.4 mark in an IHK survey.
They complained about faltering internet connections and breakdowns.
Ex-Minister of Economy Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private college in Karlsruhe - where she already cleared the field again after four months because of disagreements.
These lessons they learned so well that when government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly began to change course through the low birth rate and ageing population this summer, encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their response was immediate and final: "No way."

Audi to transform 850,000 diesel cars - automakers face backlash
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes "there are smarter options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the ventures as a recall.
European carmakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for carmakers to install plants to neutralize the exhaust fumes emitted by diesel cars is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with groping the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which used so-called shutdown devices that could regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car was tested but scaled back in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen employees have been charged in the United States, while others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in the engine development of Audi was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was expanded.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: The luxury carmaker contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen's profit.
Instead of immediately helping in the Röszke camp to establish structures that guarantee humanity, our Chancellor has officially and publicly moved the attitude of the Hungarian Government into the haze circle of National Socialism.
When negotiations began six months ago, it was Britain's turn to take over the presidency of the European Council.
This is exactly what the European Commission did recently when it presented its first strategy for the post-Kyoto Arä, which will be discussed by the European Council in March.
The Commission has the task of monitoring the practical application of this legal framework within the framework of its role defined by the Treaty.
I therefore believe that it is entirely appropriate to entrust this task to an external and morally unassailable authority in this case.
That remains a task for the future.
Madam President, it has been raised what the task of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs might be.
Enlargement has presented you and all of us with the same task that Monnet and Schuman and others faced fifty years ago: Namely, to develop a method, a structure and a vision for the future of Europe.
That message got the raft on the Isar on Saturday
The city wants to protect the Isar.
So that the Isar visitors also join in, tomorrow Saturday a raft will travel through Munich, which has a special message.
Whoever moves to the Isar again on Saturday will see a big raft between Flaucher and Reichenbach Bridge.
And this is not a common raft, with Isar tourists.
But the building council wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a large infotransparent.
It shows a mountain of rubbish.
The prelude to a public relations campaign to appeal to Isar visitors.
The motto "True Love is..." is intended to sharpen the understanding of the Isar as a protected wild river.
Already last summer the raft drove over the Isar and again this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behaviour.
The European Monetary Cooperation Fund (ERDF), chaired by a Board of Directors composed of the members of the Committee of Presidents of the Central Banks and a member of the Commission, has the main task of ensuring the functioning of the European Monetary System (EMS), which was created in March 1979 as a replacement for the "snake."
However, this monetary mechanism of the EMS differs from that of the "snake" by the fact that the EMS has been accepted by all Member States (the United Kingdom and Greece are not yet involved in the intervention mechanism for the time being), so that it is a Community system.
However, this monetary mechanism of the EMS differs from that of the "snake" by the fact that the EMS has been accepted by all Member States (the United Kingdom and Greece are not yet involved in the intervention mechanism for the time being), so that it is a Community system.
This was the mechanism that became famous under the name "snake in the tunnel" (European currency snake).
The "snake" represented the narrower range of fluctuations allowed for intra-Community currency exchange, while the term "tunnel" meant the wider range of fluctuations allowed for the exchange of Community currencies in dollars.
In the meantime, the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (established in 1973 to manage the snake in the bandwidth mechanism) continues to serve as a precursor to the new institution.
It is forbidden to hunt, catch, disturb, kill, live or dead, damage, sell, transport or surrender to other persons completely protected animals (in Upper Austria these are most birds and snakes and all lizards and amphibians).
Banotti just something that he cares more about snakes than horses.
He's done a lot for our snakes, but he hasn't cared about our horses. "
I have too much respect for the dogs, should the snakes hiss, our caravan moves on with the quiet certainty that every non-European invasion in the West was followed by a Poitiers, a Lepante, a Vienna.
Objectives c. In 1972, the mechanism of the "snake in the tunnel" reduced the fluctuation widths between the Community currencies (snake) against the bandwidths between these currencies and the dollar (tunnel).
One joined the exchange rate stability mechanism and resigned, and the snake, originally conceived as a Community-wide arrangement, reduced to a zone of monetary stability around the DM.
(Snake) to ± 2.25% and to limit the fluctuation margins between these currencies and the dollar (tunnel) to ± 4.5%.
Community weights of 2.25% (the "snake") continued to be applied by the original Member States of the Community and Denmark; the fluctuation of these currencies against the dollar (the "tunnel") was limited to 4.5%.
The return of the French franc to the queue, the relatively satisfactory functioning of this system and the introduction of a European accounting unit were characteristic of this development.
In 1975, negotiations on the inclusion of the Swiss franc in the "snake" were held in order to contribute to greater exchange rate stability in Europe.
The logical consequence was that there were repeated difficulties on the foreign exchange markets: The French franc dropped out of the "snake," the pound and lira suffered severe price losses on the international foreign exchange markets, and the German mark was upgraded to relieve the snake.
Adjustment of intervention rates within the "snake"; the central rate of the DM is increased by 2% compared to the ERE.
Within the "snake," two exchange rate adjustments have taken place, both of which affected the Scandinavian currencies.
In setting prices for 1978 / 79, this marginal adjustment was reduced, but increased again as a result of exchange rate changes in floating currencies and revaluations within the queue.
In the start-up period of the system, Member States that are not involved in the snake can opt for slightly more bandwidths for a limited period of time.
The question remains whether it will be able to resist the ups and downs that brought down the "snake."
The former "floated," the latter were involved in the snake and could only fluctuate in a predetermined frame.
In the EMS, the accounting unit applicable to the "snake" is replaced by the ECU equivalent to the value of the ERE, which is about 21% below the value of the "snake billing unit."
However, the UK and Ireland, followed by Italy, are retiring from the "snake."
The European Rut, however, has also had undeniable successes: The British renegotiations of 1975. the general direct election of the European Parliament and, on 12 March 1979, the introduction of the European Monetary System (EMS), which replaced the "snake."
This construction was known as the 'snake in the tunnel', with the fluctuations between Community currencies forming the snake and the external fluctuation limits permitted by the IMF forming the tunnel.
The three candidate countries, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark, joined the queue in May 1972, but were unable to comply with the discipline involved and have left the queue again after a few months.
At the beginning of 1974, France and Italy also left the queue, which thus consisted of only a small number of currencies under the leading position of the German mark.
This was the birth of the "snake in the tunnel."
The snake was thus half as wide (2.25%) as the tunnel (4.5%).
It was also decided that interventions with the aim of keeping European currencies within the queue should in principle take place in European currencies, while dollar interventions should only be allowed to prevent the snake from breaking out of the tunnel.
The EEC Commission subsequently proposed a common float of European currencies against the dollar - that is, keeping the snake, but leaving the tunnel - including the possibility of changing parities within the snake within certain limits and under certain conditions.
In September 1974, French Finance Minister Fourcade proposed a plan for a "concerted floating" of all Community currencies, aimed at achieving closer coordination between the five snake currencies and the four separately floating currencies.
As a starting point, he recommended the previous snake, but wanted to surround it with a kind of broader and more elastic "Boa," in which the European currencies standing outside the queue would be included.
This outer shell could have larger bandwidths than the snake and include a possible option to add and exit the currencies.
In December 1975, the Belgian Prime Minister Tindemans, in his report on the European Union, developed a series of proposals to consolidate the snake, which should have a Community character and extend its activities to the key areas of economic and monetary policy.
According to Leo Tindemans, the reinforcement of the snake should also encourage the gradual return to more international monetary stability, with the first step being to create larger stability zones in the world where exchange rates would be kept stable.
This target zone for floating currencies should gradually move towards the snake to the extent that the weighting would shift in favour of the snake.
Some may see the European Monetary System as nothing more than an enlarged and renamed "snake."
As with the snake, membership of the EMS is voluntary.
Although France, Italy and Ireland decided to participate alongside the former queue countries (i.e. BR Germany, Denmark and the Benelux countries), Britain decided in 1978 to remain outside the exchange rate mechanism, which is the main part of the EMS.
The obligations associated with participation are broadly similar to those that existed within the queue: One currency may fluctuate by a maximum of 2.25% on both sides of its bilateral parity in relation to another (for the Italian lira, however, this bandwidth is currently 6%).
- The distance between these two ECU rates serves as a basis for calculating the deviation indicator, which is a novelty of the EMS compared to the snake.
It has long been discussed whether the obligation to intervene should be determined in relation to the ECU or using the parity grid, following the example of the snake.
However, Member States that did not belong to the "snake" in December 1978 (namely France, Italy and Ireland) had the opportunity to choose larger bandwidths of up to 6%.
- Internal monetary policies: These include in particular interest rate policies that can directly affect the movement of capital and contribute to easing tensions, as the experience with the "snake" has shown.
The mechanism of the deviation indicator has thus brought two important innovations to the snakes system: For the first time, there is an objective basis for triggering consultations between the competent authorities; this goes well beyond the purely basic agreement of consultations left to the initiative of the participants.
Entry into force of the Basel Agreement, which introduces a system of reduced bandwidths in the EEC - the snake (bandwidths of 2.25%) in the tunnel (+ 2.25%).
The pound sterling, the Irish pound and the Danish crown join the snake.
The Danish crown leaves the snake.
The Italian lira leaves the snake.
The Norwegian and Swedish crowns join the snake.
The Swedish crown leaves the snake; depreciation of the Danish and Norwegian crowns by 5% compared to the ewre.
Norway leaves the snake.
Chapter II once again summarises these earlier attempts, from the formulation of a number of objectives in the Treaty of Rome to the concerted floating of certain European currencies in the "snake."
Chapter III discusses in detail the content of the EMS and its mechanisms (exchange rate and intervention mechanism, role of the ECU, credit systems), in particular highlighting the innovations of these mechanisms compared to the "snake" and analysing the conditions for proper functioning in abstracto.
In the start-up period of the system, Member States that are not involved in the snake can opt for slightly more bandwidths for a limited period of time.
Two areas of Community activity have so far been excluded from the scope of the ERE: The transactions of the European Monetary Cooperation Fund, which were based on ewre, an accounting unit based on the central rates of the currencies of the snake, and the common agricultural policy, which used the "representative rates," the equivalent of which was fixed in national currencies by Council Decision.
The candidate countries also join the "snake."
The English and Irish pounds are exiting the snake.

Mordillos Knollennasen and the laugh against the suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoon draughtsmen, the tubular noses of his characters are his trademark.
Even at 85, the Argentine is still drawing and working on a film.
His message: Laugh,"because there is too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In his early years as an artist, among other things, he sneaked through as a draughtsman for congratulatory cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when lost into my job," he once said.
After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough in the late 60s: With the release of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found plenty of fans.
Time and again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, roundish Mordillo figures tumble in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own account, he still sits at the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for adults and children, T-shirts, plush toys and watches, his droll figures continue to find much spread worldwide.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand-footer as a counterpart.
His characters speak for the first time in the 3D film, which is due to hit the cinema screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird for me," says Mordillo.
The screenplay is not written by him.
That's why he's more likely to bet on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is wordlessly produced.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to meet its commitments, France spends just 10 cents and means a comparable commitment.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
He has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is declining because of drought-reminiscent conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing major headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because in previous years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the lifespan of lavender.
There's also a small cicade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are a lot of them. "
And there is a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts holidaymakers, it is also in high demand for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we've got fewer parts with essential oil. "
Solutions being considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to dryness.
We wanted to win and we won, although I'm sorry we didn't score one or two more goals. "

The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
Staff at the weekly Riodoce typically meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in Sinaloa state caused by organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They have been told that it is important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: To take their children with them to the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: Opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings range.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the government payroll or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no respite from the violence, and as bodies pile up across the country, more and more journalists are in attendance: At least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far this year, there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter is her editor and her inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building, with two reporters in their thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared issues, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle the cases of journalists, it has opened only two criminal cases, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of killings linked to drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the killers are rarely brought to justice by journalists.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are uncomforting and though the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little use, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know the why, we distrust everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce newspaper's office in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks wide before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men, forced out of his car and shot at him 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which translates to "Twelfth River."
The gunman drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
Rumours tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is virtually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions here struggle to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot in the street, or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "calm" when only a cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Still, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is heartbroken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.
He believes two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival antitrust factions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This release may have angered the sons, suspected gang members bought up every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He was an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he teamed up with five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold $50 holdings.
In Sinaloa,"it was impossible to engage in journalism without encountering the drug problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for brave and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Prize" for her reporting in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history, wherever it led.
He volunteered that he was scared.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV.
"You've got to take on the job that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you're playing the dumb.
I don't want to be asked,"What did you do in the face of so many deaths... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team is missing Valdez, the joker who could curse like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar across the street from the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his undoing?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive in the process.
"They don't like it when you engage with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result is, even in the best of times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened with Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No cell phones were suddenly allowed in the room where Riodoce staff met for security training, days earlier it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were tasked by the state government to protect Riodoce's offices in a four-storey building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half in jest, some of the reporters wondered if those officers were among the 50 percent of police officers the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It's been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are under de facto control.
For this week's edition, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government spending that focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word on who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was needed when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows: That the restaurant is a favorite place of drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels for almost the entire century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at that eatery, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have viewed Valdez's column as the best-informed source about the kidnapping.
"Before, we would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slender body stature.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources have broken down."
Valdez's office has been rededicated to the storage room for signs and stickers protesting the killings of journalists because staff have become something they themselves would never have expected: Activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to the prosecutor's office the next morning for a demonstration because of another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body has been discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, that it is his.
Across the country, journalists have become louder by writing down "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
That day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and there trying to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez's assassination, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed because they told the truth.
She has since asked that she be reassigned by the government because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organized crime, government officials involved in it and an indifferent society.
In his last book,"Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces stuck under a blanket with organized crime.
The media watchdog group "articulo 19" assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officials last year.
"In Mexico, you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut," Ramirez said.
Obviously, the killings have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others carry on, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of its director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the headline "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still watching the streets and looking for danger.
And sometimes they are hunted, as is apparently the case with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it's a daily dance with high-risk choices.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits the drug trade frightens him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last edition had already finished, Riodoce's editors sat on the pavement outside the office and drank beer when at once all their phones started buzzing.
A series of shootings involving gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war escalated further, as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region.
From the brick edge, they posted the news on Riodoce's website via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens howled up nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the police officers who were holding vigil to see if they were in readiness.
If they were scared at all, they didn't show it.
Under the enormous portrait of the newspaper's fallen founder, whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa, Riodoce's staff followed his footsteps.
"How can you even think of closing," Bojorquez said,"when on the same day that Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the streets for reporting."
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling had "passed up" an opportunity to show he was serious about reducing the deficit by pushing out the decisions until after the election.

After the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the biggest street protests since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Beaten presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some protesters who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in prison in August and others were raped.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and judicial authorities had established a committee to investigate the unrest after the election and the government's responses to it, but Amnesty said the mandates and power of those bodies would be unclear and the results, which would have been won by the parliamentary committees, had not been made public.
Eide has denied all the allegations, but he also said that the allegations of Galbraith - who was fired - "undoubtedly caused damage to the mission because there was already a large degree of skepticism about international interference in the election."
Having separated from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, in which several thousands of people died, Abkhazia wants to use this election to prove that it is ready to join the international community.

"What I will tell him will keep him awake," K. said, always wanting to see through that he intended to negotiate something important with the lawyer, he wanted to be asked by Leni what it was, and then ask her for advice.
But the sister unfortunately disagreed; she had become accustomed, though not entirely unjustified, to acting as a special expert to the parents at the meeting of Gregory's affairs, and so even now the advice of the mother was reason enough for the sister to insist on the removal not only of the box and the desk, which she had first thought of alone, but on the removal of all furniture, with the exception of the indispensable canape.

When he informed Kitty of Stepan Arkadyevitch's advice to travel abroad, he was very surprised that she disagreed with it, but had her own very specific thoughts about her mutual future life.
On his face was an expression of indecision and a request for advice, support and guidance on this matter, in which his understanding failed.
"If you ask me for advice," she said, after finishing her prayer and getting her face free again,"so I advise you not to do it.
"Please, just follow my advice," said the old princess; "put a sheet of paper over the ingrown and moisten it with rum, then it will never get moldy even without ice."
On Levin's advice, Darya Alexandrovna drove off before sunrise.
But an understanding medical treatment and sea baths in the summer have restored his health, and now I have given him on the doctor's advice to school.
The affairs of Sergei Ivanovitch and the sister and the peasants who came to him for advice, and who had already become completely accustomed to no longer dealing with these matters, were just as impossible for Levin as it is impossible to throw in a child who is already being held in his arms.

Dinosaur used camouflage to dodge its enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
Now researchers have found that the initial findings of a Canadian miner's incredible rhino have been so well preserved that experts have described it as "the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
It was so well preserved that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said it had had something of a "troubled past."
The report in the journal "Current Biology" called it "the best preserved armoured dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well-preserved condition has stunned researchers who describe it as "truly remarkable."
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivore is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He came across something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years exposing the wild animal within the 2,500-pound (1,100kg) clump of earth.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled.
"If you just blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that although this herbivore is covered with an armor and resembles a changing tank, it was likely threatened by flesh-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to blend better into its surroundings and dodge its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature from the family of nodosaurs first made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it.
The astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour across his body.
They discovered the countershading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning the creature's top was darker than its bottom.
Although the countershading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from flesh-eating dinosaurs that evolution favoured the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use the countershade - think deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodosaur has been subjected to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows just how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous period must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur's skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved intestinal content, to find out what it has eaten as its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where it sank on its back to the bottom of the sea.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but is also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the early Cretaceous period.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it, so if you're just shivering a little with your eyes, you could almost believe he's asleep. "
The Cretaceous period was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of its fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5m) long, six-tonne monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta sank in the sea after death and was mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armour, and is complete from the snout to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long spikes that protruded from his shoulders.
The researchers believe the armored herbivore was swamped through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial preserved its armour in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as' rare as a win in the Lotto.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Fossilized remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured panels that carry the animal's skull.

In the thunderstorm: Mass carambolage on A8: Many injured
Violent accident on Thursday night on the A8: Just under 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.
There are numerous injured, mile-long traffic jams - and gaffers.
About 20 people were injured in a mass carambolage on the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8) late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police, about 5 p.m. between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg County) junctions, nearly 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, had crashed into each other during a thunderstorm.
The exact number of people injured was not disclosed at first.
They were light to medium-serious injuries, a police spokesman said.
A large number of rescue vehicles were at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a backlog of about ten kilometres was formed.
As an AZ reporter reports, massive obstruction also occurred on the oncoming carriageway - caused by numerous gaffers.
The fire brigade noted the hallmarks of vehicle drivers, who now face sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18:45, a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests' comfort check-in "
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: One sits on the train and sleeps unsuspecting.
Or one is immersed in his work and just has an ingenious thought.
And then: Pufff.
If the conductor comes and awakens you gently or tears the passenger out of the workflow in the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the careless ticket control.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you have taken your seat and devalue the ticket.
A test operation is currently running on two routes.
"If the offer arrives, we will expand it.
It is then expected to be available on many more long-distance routes in Germany early next year,"a rail spokesman said.
"Comfort check-in" is what the train calls the ticket devaluation without a conductor.
In order to be able to use them, however, some requirements have to be met: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to have booked an online ticket - which is already what most passengers do.
You also have to have bought it through the train's app, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of booking tickets anyway.
And finally, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works like this: You get on the train, call up your ticket under "My Tickets."
The test customers will then see a button for electronic devaluation.
Train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
When the train attendant arrives at seat Y at ticket control, he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with an already devalued online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, continue to work, keep silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: One for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should benefit the passengers.
"If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train attendants, simply check in at the DB Navigator yourself.
This allows passengers to make their travel time on the train more personal,"says Michael Peterson, DB Fernverkehr's marketing board.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than they do today to respond to individual customer needs."
Those who often train know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are among the biggest annoyances.
Because often you yourself, but in any case one of the fellow passengers does not have all the documents you need for the devaluation of online tickets.
Either the credit card or identity card is missing or otherwise a document to show.
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, leading to bad mood in the compartment or metropolitan area and delays in checking their own ticket, and ultimately taking the conductor's time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Further train numbers on the same route have not yet been unlocked.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question,"Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just a day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis native sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled across a post from someone from high school.
"The police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it is still lying in the street," it said.
Confused, as no one else had posted the information on her feed, she shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on her timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis area was in the process of tweeting live the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out in the street and would stay there for four hours.
"This is wild," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put down her mobile phone to return to tweets about people on Canfield Drive later in the evening.
There were photos of the police tape and people shouting, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father carrying a sign reading: 'Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed with a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another police officer unsecured his rifle and shouted: "I'm going to kill you... animals all."
"This is not common," Ferrell recalled her statement.
"That's not the kind of murder we've become accustomed to and that we can call typical."
In that moment, I felt chills.
I was angry and crying. "
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11pm, she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided the two would head to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary,"Whose Streets?," in cinemas from 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
As Ferrell headed to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a floral dress and matching crown, the two discussed a conversation they had countless times before this morning "about the black experience and the black condition."
"You remember how I taught you, when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" She recalled what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take them,"Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a culmination of... what happened in the past.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
It needs to be well developed, know not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution, and what we need to do to become free to liberate ourselves.
Even though I'm lucky enough to give her an experience where she doesn't personally experience blatant racism, she's no different to the next black women's child.
I feel like I'm doing her a disservice to keep her away from it. "
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was on South Florissant Road, a location opposite the Police Department that became a camp area as activists waited for Officer Darren Wilson's possible non-indictment.
There, Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who was making lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to protesters.
Slowly, a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to take shape.
"My activism totally changed after August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I've had no experience in organising.
It's all come. "
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?"
That skepticism was fuelled by countless cases of people, often whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson didn't center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with then-co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around death row inmates.
His involvement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals, the team of "Whose Streets?" Followed in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. We talk," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people are portrayed, because that's how I'm going to be portrayed."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement is "not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," Folayan said - she proved to be the film's most outspoken participant.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" Show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing when she first saw the finished product.
"But I understood that there needs to be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders, who coined the film "BlacklivesMatter" on social media after the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole," Ferrell said,"and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women have to bear the brunt of everything. "
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really held upright by black women and a lot of black women."
However, she insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action," with Ferrell chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who stirred up that energy," she said.
"It's no coincidence, even though she was at the forefront because there's so much at stake in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman.
You can feel their energy through the screen. "
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years for blocking a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A mess."
Yet she clings to a chant and she's been committed to that memory ever since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
"It's our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We've got nothing to lose - except our chains. "
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
"Not in the front, otherwise we're blocking, and not putting all the yellow caps on the same benches, in the room!"
"Very little space has remained owned by the city and we would like Extra Place to continue to be owned by the city," she said.
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it was repaving the small street and setting up seats meant, among other things, for a cafe to which the company wants to rent out space.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face recognition system, this' receptionist 'can recognise how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, although it is far from built.
But the idea of a shopping mall at the southern end of the pedestrian precinct has been dividing the population into advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
The subject hardly leaves one cold.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."
While some say to the Bit-Galerie: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "Don't need a man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).
While advocates rely on a gallery to draw more customers to the city, which also benefits the rest of the shops, opponents fear the pedestrian will then bleed out.
Add to this: The gallery is planned exactly on the site where the Farmers Market Hall stands, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will end with the start of construction work.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - towards Beda Square with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been shopping almost weekly in the Farmers Market Hall for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women again and again very gladly.
We also discovered the butchery for ourselves.
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities, too, there is.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery comes down to the amount of rent.
But this should not be very low in the new project."
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether it's clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find that superfluous.
There is already enough of that in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved.
After all, the product offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger firms, because the rents there are often unsustainable for a retailer.
What a pity, there are almost no more specialty shops and what is left of them will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit together for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the farmers market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the ghost bit gallery manage to drive all the shops out of Bitburg before?""
George Marquet: "This is just not going to work.
And a shopping center that stands empty, no one needs either.
I think it would have been better to promote a proper farmers' market instead of this gallery.
But there is no place for a farmers market hall thanks to the insanely many - I think - senseless construction projects in Bitburg.
If the farmers "market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A fitting resemblance: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room at the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces - white, black and brown, almost imperceptibly alike - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek-toppers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after she made public classified diplomatic messages on the website WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance (A fitting resemblance).
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and landmark dissident whose conviction was commuted by Barack Obama when he had just three days left in his post.
Dewey-Hagborg has created a sharp, if somewhat intellectual, commentary not only on the malleability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning, from which 30 portraits were created of what someone might look like with these genomic data.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but has already spoken openly about identifying as a woman since her puberty, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison, her image was suppressed, so much so that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie in which Manning sits visibly unwell in a driver's seat wearing a platinum blonde wig - that she was associated with.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came away from the huge success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to create a picture of what these people might look like.
That was when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They did an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't be visited at the time and she couldn't be photographed, so you made contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to do a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal briefs who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "suppressed Images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, that foresaw a future in which the president would transform Chelsea's judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would actually call for Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, just days after the book was published, was a welcome kind of happy coming together.
There is also something deep and strong now at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is waging a war against whistleblowers from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions he was supposed to fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with her oversized signature underneath (the "i" in her family name is emblazoned with a heart), called for an end to "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand-footer of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped, by including the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon), to show how strikingly similar, at least in biological terms, we all are.
"What people will hopefully take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data is to an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on view.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of those stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, kept in a room of its own, is a page from the aforementioned comic novella.
She shows Manning showing up with a hands-free phone in hand from the United States disciplinary barracks like King-Kong.
"If they cold your speech, then they won," it read.
"So never keep your mouth shut."
"It came straight from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia.
"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person - as presciently anticipated in the comic book - but if she should, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulacres that rally together like hordes of protesters.
That was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, down to size (5 "2, Manning's stature), where her genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind their liberation."
Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee wanted for killing
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are being sought as suspects after a man was stabbed with fatal injuries in a luxury Chicago apartment.
On Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County District Court records show.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, passed away after several stitches.
A community alert system released by the Chicago Police Department says the corpse was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still pronounced dead at the scene of what happened, and detectives are investigating the stitches as a homicide while police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem had now been placed on leave and barred from entering the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal matter that is being investigated by the relevant authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior Treasury assistant at the University of Oxford.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to assist the US investigative authorities in any way we can."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urges the suspects to stand up to authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received an enigmatic tip saying something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident had also taken place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza's management team released a statement to residents: "Police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way to give something back to those who made sacrifices.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.

"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not be long before the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RusADA) are implemented.
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RusADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard,"Mutko explained on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA's roadmap to comply with the code, which describes the criteria for RusADA's reinstatement and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future,"he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list notes that Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Speaking about the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation as our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we're not going to admit something that doesn't exist. "
Mutko's words were consistent with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's independent anti-doping commission.
Speaking to Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept this report unconditionally,"Smirnov added.
RusADA was barred from conducting doping checks in Russia in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal by WADA.
However, it has been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli declared that RusADA was "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.

When entering the Expo 98 construction site, one must present a card that is issued only to workers who have demonstrated that they are legally resident in the country and are registered with social security.
"Optical cards" can be easily connected to all computers and combined with other types of cards.
Roland Fastberg will take over the second part as he designs the applications for the cards.
There are different cards on the market, and the important thing is that we are talking about machine-readable cards.
I have a functional map here and I'll hold it up once.
You could also put a magnetic strip on the card and then combine all three types of machine-readable cards in one card.
In some applications it might be important that today you can actually combine different technologies in one map.
Every now and then there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.

"The price-quality ratio at the time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive across the Czech Republic, the prices for district heating vary from city to city.
However, the price in Prague remains one of the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewage charges are expected to rise by 7.4 per cent.
(Unless otherwise stated, all prices are from Toys "R" Us.)
Still, he foresees a slump in interest rates, which banks are trying to offset with increases in fees and the prices of loans.
Even if it assumes that the war over liabilities - which penalises interest margins - will drain, the risk surcharges that banks and savings banks have to pay for their emissions to maintain liquidity are already being passed on to the price of loans as compensation for dwindling profit margins.
"They like to go out, but they pay close attention to prices," he insists.
The business will go well with those "who offer quality at good prices with a good service," he adds, reminding us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices are most in demand by 25 euros.
"If you do a tender and there are few applicants, your prices will soar."
"The thought, however, is that it is not the price that is crucial, but the expertise of the individuals," Laporte reiterated.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
This is the price to protect the euro.
On Tuesday, in any case, the scissors with German interest rates would have reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of contracts to cover bankruptcy risk had risen to 263 points, which had caused some headlessness in Rome.

Aldi no longer sells eggs for now
The business groups shared that.
It was a purely precautionary measure that no further health impairment could be assumed, the communication said.
As of now, only eggs are likely to be delivered to Aldi, which have been shown to have been tested negatively for fipronil-containing anti-lice.
Aldi wanted to create clarity and transparency for its customers.
If we do not have an urgent debate, this matter will come to the end of the queue of motions for resolutions for the political committee, as happened with the resolution on Pakistan, which has not yet been discussed by that committee after three months.
Every minute of the working day, another five people join the queue, those in line for unemployment benefits.
The long queues of lorries at the internal borders of the EC prove every day that the well-sounding concept of the common market does not mean much.
In the UK, this distribution took place in inhumane conditions, because pensioners had to queue as they were in their thirties to get their free packet of butter.
Logically, this causes inconvenience, as the queues of non-French travellers - quite contrary to the notion of "grandeur," which arguably inspired the official who invented the system - are much longer than those of the nationals of the Member State to which the said airport belongs.
In addition, the veterinary service ensured that trucks carrying live animals or perishable food were cleared outside the queue, that the animals were soaked and veterinary care and that delays were kept as low as possible.
In fact, some are seriously hampered by blocked roads, and I myself was more than irritated when I had to wait in a long queue in front of a military post.
For example, voters queuing in 1000m queues were sent home again in the evening because there was no electric light.
With regard to the number of Members of Parliament, I have seen long queues waiting to be able to use their card.
The planned free movement of persons, which was due to enter into force in 1993, with controls and uncivilised queues at borders, certain bureaucratic practices and the presentation of passports
Part of a roadway that can be marked by longitudinal markings and which is wide enough ¡st for a queue of motor vehicles, except motorcycles.
The implementation of these checks requires that drivers of commercial vehicles carry extensive documentation and wait in queues in front of customs offices until their turn.
There are 2,792 unemployed workers on every vacancy in Sunderland, and more than half of school leavers from 1981 had not yet found work when school leavers from 1982 already joined the queue of jobseekers.
This last point may seem redundant today, but so soon after the "bad time" that lasted until the 1950s, every politician's empty shelves in the bakeries, food cards and long queues outside the grocery stores were all too present.
In the UK, the practice is very different, i.e. there are both really personal conversations and the so-called "cattle market," where teachers sit at tables in the school hall and parents queue up to be able to change a few short, more or less meaningless words with the teacher in question.
If adequate content is available, citizens would "prefer to work online 'rather than queue," Liikanen told CORDIS News.
At the end of 2000, however, the consumer who wanted to pay in euros often encountered cashiers who - not accustomed to this - had to consult their superiors in order to be able to handle the payment, while he himself caught the impatient glances of the customers waiting in the queue.
That's why the snake.
The motto of "eGovernment" could be: "Rather sit at the computer than queue," because electronic government services are in fact supposed to allow the easy handling of public services over the Internet, so that we no longer have to queue in the offices.
As a result, aircraft are often forced to fly a long detour to reach their destination, or "queue up" to use the corridors.
The EU-funded sculpteur project opens up new ways to visit the major European galleries and museums, so that endless queues and tired feet will soon become a thing of the past.
The handling procedures must be streamlined and simplified so that long queues of lorries no longer hinder border traffic between Kaliningrad and the neighbouring regions of Poland and Lithuania.
This leads to long queues forming on the winding coastal road that leads to the village.
We are becoming increasingly aware of the loss of quality of life we are suffering from traffic jams, waiting in queues and standing in front of closed shops, libraries and public authorities.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, a meeting he had rejected with reference to the upcoming election in Israel at the time.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election; however, that figure has fallen from 78 percent last month.
They would find it better if he did not win the election, because "he has such radical views, I do not know if that is good."
The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure happiness among your employees at your e-commerce start-up, but the polls didn't work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.
"There was just never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.
She has called people from the outside for help.
A new breed of human resources start-ups is growing to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, provide anonymity and complaint hotlines to employees, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and contact the board directly.
"You now have tools like strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" Said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap polls and polls from certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval scores - so you can drill down on why.
Companies come to realize that at the forefront of workplace culture must remain so that you don't become the next Uber to be embroiled in scandal since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could own more than $118.7 billion in value in 2020, according to financial technology website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a surge in interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber case in disrepair.
Convergence has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send bespoke "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the supervisory board.
"The court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and chief executive of Convercent.
If a company is found to be treating its employees poorly or behaving unethically, it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has deployed Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope that he or she was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints from employees.
Now that the company is using Convercent, problems previously hidden by executives who sat in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair internships - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience of employment," said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's Risk Management Group.
"And we're protecting our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed over ethics violations caused by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took the "social media to get to their right" that companies realized you couldn't prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge companies recurring fees for using their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors, who have supported both start-ups.
Convergence received $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the total capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
These investments come as little surprise, given the interconnected nature of business, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just stakes.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices belong, and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies are doing well. Companies are doing well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, it's no wonder you'll find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture important.
But the data is useless if a company's administrators don't take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change doesn't come fast enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
"If you're asking for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, which has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.
"Because if you don't follow employees will ask themselves," Have you really heard me?
Do you care?
And who you don't care about, why should I? "
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, according to Errett.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communications training to address the issues.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company keeps getting new insights about employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to better retention of workers in an industry known for high sales.
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers too.
And if you lose customers, then you're going to lose businesses.

I know how soon the youth fades and the beauty fades, when in the cup which happiness offers us, even a drop of shame, a hint of squalor of conscience is dreamed; and I want no sacrifice, no grief, no destruction - that is not to my taste.
This sight of the suffering and sacrifice of another turned my senses away from the exclusive thinking about myself.
"Jane, I want to be a brother to you - my sisters will be your sisters - without you making us the victim of your just claims."
Maybe I wouldn't have to make that sacrifice to him for long because only three months would go by until he left.
You might decide to be at my hand, to stand next to my chair - to look after me like a good little warden, (because you have a loving heart and a magnanimous soul that compel you to make sacrifices to those you pity) and that should no doubt be enough for me.
"Because you're happy if you can make sacrifices."
That I am allowed to wrap with my arms what I think is worth - to press my lips on what I love - to rest with what I trust: Does that mean making a sacrifice?
And if that's the case, then I'm happy to be able to make sacrifices, though. "

It was a very gray day; a matte sky that hung full of snow clouds vaulted over the landscape; then and when some snowflakes fell, lingering on the hard-frozen paths and bushes and trees without melting.
Again I looked out; we drove past a church; I saw the low, wide tower looming against the sky, its bells proclaiming the quarter of an hour; then I also saw a narrow set of lights on a hill; it was a village or a hamlet.
Behind and above the mountain top, the sky arch spread, deep blue as at dusk time; into the sky, the breast image of a woman, painted in as soft and indeterminate colors as it was only possible for me to put together.
A violent storm is blowing under this sky and over that mountain peak.
I love this day, I love this bleak sky; I love this calm, this stillness, this solidification of the world in this frost.
In the kitchen, in the cellar master's pantry, in the hall of the servants, in the large entrance hall, - everywhere the same life; in the salons was only peace and quiet when the blue sky and the halcyonic sunshine of the splendid spring weather called out the guests to the park.
It was a warm, breezy, but not a bright, hot summer evening; the meadow workers were busy all the way along; the sky, though not cloudless, promised good weather for the coming days; its bloom - where it was visible at all - was mild, and the clouds moved high and translucent.
I don't know if it was a beautiful, clear or a stormy rainy day; as I walked down the great driveway, I didn't look up to heaven or down to earth; my eyes were with my heart, and both were now with Mr. Rochester.
It seemed to say: "My magnificent visions are wonderful, but I must not forget that they are absolutely without existence." In my brain I carry a rosy sky and a green, flowering Eden; but I know very well that here outside lies a rough path before my feet, which I have to walk through, and that around me black clouds of thunderstorms are gathering, which I have to defy.
But I did not look up to the sun, nor to the smiling sky, nor down to the awakening nature.
I looked up to the sky; it was clear; a friendly star sparkled just above the summit of the rock cliff.
Perfect beauty is a strong expression; but I do not take it back, nor do I justify it; traits as sweet as the temperate climate of Albion they only ever carved; colors as rose red and lily white as they ever produced and bloomed under this cloudy sky, in these humid winds, justify in this case the designation: Perfect beauty.
I stared at the bare wall; it seemed to me like a sky strewn densely with shining stars - and every single one of them meant to me a happiness, a joy, a deed!
A fresh wind was blowing from the west; it came from the hills and brought with it sweet scents of heather and rushes; cloudless blue in the sky; the stream swelled by frequent spring rain came roaring through the gorge, and bright, golden rays of the sun and sapphire inks of the firmament were reflected on its surface.
On the evening of one day, whose characteristic had been cloudy skies, cold wind and uninterrupted fine, penetrating rain, I came to this house.
He raised his hand and opened his eyelids, directed, as it seemed with great effort, the view up to the sky, then looked at the amphitheater of the forest - but for him, all was emptiness and darkness.
I led him out of the wild, damp forest into the sunny fields; I described to him how juicy green they were; how refreshed the flowers and hedges looked after the rain, how sparkling blue the sky was.
Even now he cannot see clearly; he cannot read or write much; but he finds the way without being led by the hand; the sky is no longer a colourless surface for him, the earth no empty space.
"And just as I picked the highest tree in the forest," the pigeon continued with a raised voice,"and just as I thought I'd finally got rid of it, they even have to wind down from the sky!
Alice laughed so loudly that she had to run back into the bushes, for fear that they would like to hear her, and when she looked out again, the fish varnish was gone, and the other sat on the floor by the door and looked silly up into the sky.
It was not quite finished; through the uncovered attic one saw the grey sky.
By now the sky had turned completely blue.
And if we ascend to the cathedral without stopping at the thousand barbarisms of all kinds - what did one begin with the pretty little tower, which was based on the average point of the cross vault, and which was as slender and bold as its neighbour, the (equally destroyed) tower of the holy chapel, but higher, sharper, more toned and richer than the towers, penetrated into the sky?
Only here did this dome building appear to be the boldest, freest, most elaborate and jagged tower ever to see the sky through its pierced cone.
This is apparent and listed in view of our cold and rainy skies.
And when he opened the window of the cell, he pointed his finger at the mighty Notre-Dame-Church, which at the starry sky took off the black outlines of its two towers, its stone surfaces and its mighty roof back, and resembled a monster, two-headed sphinx, who had sat down in the middle of the city.
Next to the bed was a window whose smashed trenches, resembling a spider's web torn by the rain, through their shattered curves allowed a piece of sky and the moon to glimpse, resting in the distance on a down cushion of tender clouds.
In this passionate declaration of love, the gypsy sent up a glimpse of heavenly happiness to the dirty blanket that represented heaven here.

At his feet, some chickens picked through the bushes, crawled away the gold beetles in the sunshine; above his head, groups of sheep clouds moved in the blue sky; on the horizon, the tower of the Sanct-Victor Abbey broke through the hill line with its slate obelisk; and the windmill on the Copeaux hill watched whistling as the working wings of his mill turned.
The sky was pale and so was the water of the river.
Here it was only Claude who stood upright, and the obelisk who lay; but as the river that reflected the sky increased the depth beneath it, the immense promontory seemed as boldly swung up into the void as any cathedral tower, and the impression was the same.
The façade was shrouded in darkness; in the background, the sky sparkled in starlight.
The air was cold, clouds moved in the sky, whose large, white waves poured one over the other as they crushed at the corners, depicting the ice course of a river in winter.
She slowly approached him, raising her eyes to the sky.
The air, the sky, the morning, the evening, the moonlight, my good friends the country strokes, the funny strokes with the girls, the beautiful monuments of Paris to study, three thick books to write, one of them against the bishop and his mills, and God knows what else?
To whom do you owe it, that you breathe this air, that you see this sky, that you can still delight your lark head with foolishness and bitterness!
Above this flame one saw the monsters towers with their two ascending and glaring fronts, one of which was dark, the other completely red lit, and which appeared even larger in the monster's shadow, which they cast in the sky.
The forecourt shone and threw a ray of light to the sky; the wooden bump lit on the platform still burned and illuminated the city far away.
The sky was completely pure.
In the fog the waters began to flow, the ice cover bared, and the plaice set in motion; the cloudy, foaming rivers flowed faster, and just on Sunday after Easter towards evening the fog tore apart, the dark clouds dissolved into white lamb clouds, the sky cleared, and then the right spring began.
He stood and listened, and soon looked down on the moist, mossy earth, soon after the attentively listening Laska, soon after the sea of bald treetops that spread before him at the foot of the hill, soon after the darkened sky riddled with white clouds.
While they spoke like this, Laska pointed the ears, looked up to the sky and then threw a reproachful glance at the two hunters.
She immediately drew him into a conversation with the genuine French exuberance of kindness, praised him happily because he had such a dearest daughter, and lifted Kitty straight to heaven, calling her, though she stood by, a true treasure, a pearl, an angel of consolation.

I have only just looked up to heaven, and there was nothing in it but two white stripes.

The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It's heading to 11 p.m. as a crowd of UCLA football players entertain themselves on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have pulled out their jersey tops and show their backs full of sweat from the first day of training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes represent a lunch break.
Players enrolled for the summer classes will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.
"This is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday turned into Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until Friday's finals.
That's why UCLA's first three workouts should start at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate the players' already-packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of camp almost a week after last season and did practical exercises during summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons at Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 practice sessions over the course of August, with 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their opener against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA's rule change, even if it adds another point to the players' busy routes.
"We put this enormous strain on it three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
"And they've just pushed it through, they continue to place themselves, they're great people.
I think once we get to Saturday and we have more time, it's going to be really great. "
UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished, which will be no easy task given the clear sightlines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, an upper-class hotel that has already been dogged with footballs clearing a protective net behind a goalpost.
Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora acknowledged there could be a problem once those rooms are vacant during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
"That's a real problem, and it's not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then tune in there to record an exercise.

Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake news to third-party fact-checkers and then display their results under the original post, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday, saying it is one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false messages and send them to fact-checkers who will potentially display fact-checking results from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many believe also influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to May's presidential election, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings as they did before elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review was being launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to realizing what stories are being challenged by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "related article" and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
Creating a comic novel: A castle in the history of England
In its more recent past, little Scotney Castle was featured in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent, and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
"What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."
"A Castle in England' spans the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward, documenting the families who lived in Scotney, each story illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book by Rhodes to be based on an archive: He wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I just reacted to the thumb print on the side of a letter like that written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"That's his thumb print!
And letters always smell of smoke, because at that time a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he himself were in it, too.
Oh, I love archives! "
For someone so smitten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and Arts Council England and lived in a castle for nearly four months ("To be honest: I overstated my welcome a little bit") this all seems too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, sifting through the archives and studying the castle's many treasures and curiosities, such as the mounted hyenas heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscape painters, gardeners and sometimes the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "whiskey and started to write."
Scotney's intimate story is relatively unknown, as the National Trust did not get full access until 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees only just started taking care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, throw it to the attic."
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps depicting who owned what: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes,"but there was a birch there that two families fought for.
Guys, let everything go his way! "
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to delve into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred at the castle in 1380, in this book titled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising started in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected? "
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as' The Priest ', which tells the story of the Jesuit patron, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The smuggler', which depicts 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell staging his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney: "The Lords seemed to be quite crooks, keep getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking guys, with a talent to advertise heirlooms. "
After the end of his assignment at the castle, Rhodes is on the lookout for other unique writing experiences
He has endured a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like,"Ah, now I have to deal with the damn life again."

Campaign launched: Over 300-year-old Mary's Chapel shrouded in Rhöndorf
On Friday, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand (Rundschau from Thursday) by covering the 301-year-old Marienkapelle chapel in Rhöndorf.
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August, as the highlight of the campaign, there is to be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth.
"Too beautiful for us.
Or?,"the makers of the action have been asking since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel.
"We don't really think so (of course!)," they write on their website unlocked yesterday.
"But we're using this measure to get your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems.
Basically, we firmly believe that, as Bad Honnefer citizens, we are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it goes on.
"There's a need to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city a distinctive unique selling point."
After all, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost a medium five-digit amount of its new umbrella brand and the campaign.
So, to get back to the matter, when I saw my magician stepping into the room so accompanied by a cavalier, it was as if I sewed a hissing and the green-eyed serpent of jealousy ringed in countless turns from the moonlit balcony, crawled into my vest and in two minutes had found the way to the innermost of my heart!
"Snake!" Screamed the pigeon.
"Snake I say!" Repeated the pigeon, but with a muted voice, and continued swallowingly: "Everything I have tried, and nothing is pleasing to them!"
"Tree roots I tried, river banks I tried, hedges I tried," the pigeon continued, without paying attention to them; "but these snakes!
"As if it were not enough trouble to hatch the eggs," said the pigeon,"I still have to watch the snakes day and night!
"But I'm not a snake, I tell you!" Cried Alice,"I'm a I'm a -"
"I have eaten eggs, of course," said Alice, who was a very truth-loving child; "but little girls eat eggs just as well as snakes."
"I don't think so," the pigeon said; "but if they do, now they're kind of snakes, so much I know."
This was something so new for Alice that she kept quiet for a couple of minutes; the pigeon used the opportunity and continued: "You're looking for eggs, I know that only too well, and what do I care if you're a little girl or a snake?"
"The spectacle, and to the devil with the flames!" He shouted out of bodily strength, wading like a snake around his column bun.
The old symbol of the snake, which bites into the tail, fits mainly on the science.
It is the expression of humanity that is completely rejuvenated; it is the human thought that takes one form and attracts another for it; it is the complete and final skinning of that symbolic serpent that has imagined the Spirit since Adam's times.
The young girl looked at him again, then she blushed, as if a flame had risen into her cheeks; and while she took her tambourine under her arm, she walked towards the door of the house in the middle of the astonished spectators, where Phoenix called her; slowly her step and wavering, her gaze disturbed, like that of a bird following the magic effect of a snake.
It could have been likened to a snake pursuing it.
This classification is important in practice as it lays down the conditions for the approval of new planting or replanting, for premiums for abandonment of vineyards and other existing restructuring measures.
The most important measure is the award of premiums for the final abandonment of vineyards.
An immediate and definitive cessation of industrial restructuring plans, as is now necessary in view of the enormous human and economic waste in which Community interventions at Community level have contributed, requires the abandonment of sectoral studies aimed at carrying out further restructuring plans or further investigations into the current restructuring plans.
For the West, however, the loss of exports, the abandonment of markets and the resulting uneconomic distribution flows add up to the seven times higher amount of about $80 billion.
Regulation 456 provides for the granting of premiums for the temporary and final abandonment of certain vineyards and for the renunciation of replanting with wine.

Ministry wants to refurbish track for racetrack shuttle
Again and again in the past months the future of the Rennsteishuttles had been discussed - now it should go very fast.
Before the end of the year, the ramshackle track on which the tourist railway runs is to be built.
Construction work on the track is expected to begin later this year to secure the future of the racetrack shutter in the long term, according to the Department for Transport.
"With the decision to continue to order and renovate the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this link, which is particularly important for tourism," said Transport State Secretary Klaus Sühl in Erfurt on Friday.
He put the cost of repairing the line at about 2.5 million euros.
Of that total, the country takes over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle will continue to be ordered by the country in the future, is currently being finalised, said Sühl.
The Ministry and the Southern Thuringia Railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details.
"With that, the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," Sühl said.
The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
As a result, the Rennsteig shuttle should be ordered on a regular basis on December 2017.
The Rennsteig Shuttle is a popular rail link between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations, especially for tourists.
In recent months, a pilot operation had tested whether the route would be used by a sufficient number of people to re-order it regularly in the future.
The route is also very dilapidated in parts.

"Due to an inferiority complex almost inherent to Canadians, Canadian political leaders may be much more likely to talk about domestic issues of everyday life than to blame the United States in this election (as in the 1988 campaign on free trade)," he describes.

The entire election could be annulled if the lawsuits brought by Gbagbo are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
Madam President, there are new victims of ETA, but there are also new victims of Spanish oppression: New arrests, new torture, new transfers of prisoners imprisoned in the Basque Country.
Firstly, it concerns the method; it is a powerless and opaque procedure for the public, which in reality excludes the other institutions of the Union and in which governments fall victim to their own labyrinth.
Many victims are young children, terrible impressions, terrible mutilations, the path of life destroyed before it started properly.
We must ensure that those who have been innocent victims of the fight against crime - perhaps we should call it collateral damage - do not languish completely isolated from their loved ones in prisons.
However, in the face of this crisis, we must guarantee both health and food safety for consumers and the income of farmers, as well as the income of butchers, Kaldaunenhändler and wholesalers, all of whom have fallen victim to the negligence of national and Community authorities.
Appropriate measures must be taken to guarantee the victims of crime the following rights: The right to submit and receive information; the guarantee of communication; participation in proceedings and access to free legal aid; adequate protection of the person and privacy; the right to criminal compensation and the possibility of dispute resolution through arbitration.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just when you thought it couldn't get even crazier in 2017, comes a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yes, actually.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye colour, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
"People make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we're going to get to see them a lot more often," Mr Sharkey said at the release of his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customize" his robot according to his beliefs, choosing everything from the robot's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more troubling as many robots own the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as adapted to your personality as possible," swarms True Companion's website.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods over the course of the day - quite like real people!
She can be tired, fixated on conversation or she can be "in a mood"!"
There are many disturbing aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female traits, the allusions to rape when you approach a step on frigid (read here: Reluctant) Farrah, worry one the most.
On its website, True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" The website states.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional encore.
Most men, of course, won't hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their rising popularity, they still remain on the fringes of consumer culture for the time being.
But what leaks from the fringes can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
And many people are not weird or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is some overlap, after all, that these sophisticated sex robots are emerging at a time when women's rights are under threat around the world, when there is a president in the White House who has boasted of sexually assaulting women.
The most deterrent aspect of the TV series' The handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the entangled bodies and the outcast eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this doesn't feel like a big leap.
The aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with porn star proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to mimic the movement of a real body.
But, to the point, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots don't represent real women.
They can't separate from their companion or just walk away.
They have no mediation or a backstory, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total subjugation.
In other words, they are pleasing slaves.
Or to put it in the way of 2017: Service girls

Although they love Le Mans, the "Green Hell" of the Nürburgring Nordschleife or Indianapolis, the Monaco GP course remains unrivalled.
But whether that is enough to stop the decline of the Catholic Church's membership in the long term, I doubt - all the more so as many bishops and cardinals in Brazil and other Latin American countries balk at the new course.
Only those who successfully complete a three-day course in the company's own training academy, in which they learn the correct handling and application of SEMCO, will be allowed to distribute this building material later on.

"This prize is awarded within the framework of the Swiss Innovation Forum and is awarded to companies that provide outstanding innovative and technological services and have above-average market potential," explains jury member Hans Baumgartner, Head of SME Business at Credit Suisse.
What does the price have for a meaning for you?
In addition to the publications, prizes stand for the quality of the research carried out.
What do prices mean to you?
People are happy about any price.
I am aware that there is good luck in this and that you also have to accept the prices with a bit of humility - you usually build on the preparatory work of others.

The Romand himself could hardly grasp his second prize, the Best Album Pop / Rock National:

However, I do not believe that such prizes are groundbreaking for one's own artistic development.
I would hardly have developed any differently artistically, aesthetically, without these awards.
For me, a prize is first and foremost a great recognition, as one otherwise only receives in research for important publications - with the difference that such an award, unlike a publication in specialist circles, shows that one's own work is also perceived and appreciated by people who do not belong to one's own field of expertise.

Even where the course to be taken is clear, nothing will happen if there are significant capacity deficits - in other words, if there is a lack of human, financial or other resources.
It encourages the new government to pursue the course of stability and national reconciliation and to promote social harmony.
Bearing in mind the experience in Haiti, the Central African Republic, Guinea-Bissau and Timor-Leste, I urge the Member States not to stop prematurely on the road to peace and peace missions of the United Nations.
The Security Council therefore praises the course followed by the democratically elected government of Lebanon and the Lebanese armed forces in exercising their respective responsibilities in the period leading up to the holding of the presidential election.
Trump's great achievement?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have also divided small-format families.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the US offering advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-voting relatives.
We are all reportedly making an effort to make our filter bubbles burst.
Less noticed is the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and has long been involved with Republicans in our family, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship she had fought with for decades over politics, is suddenly and quite peculiar on the same page.
This is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it strikes me in another context that this also carries significant risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the strength to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the gruesome possibility that one day his kittens will no longer repel us.
There is, however, an even more terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who suddenly appear to be the epitome of reasonableness compared to his standards.
I find myself infested these days by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, do in fact strike one as a very mild offence.
If Trump goes, the next Republican nominee just needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels in the New York park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crisp and the animals twist to look over their own shoulders full of fear - extremely sinister and the climactic music conveys this in an odd way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: The views of tall buildings grow old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city doesn't live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss cottage - the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn't count - but a large roundabout in north London.
The Central Park carousel is still a strangely magical experience, however, as here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily no one asked about it.
On the other hand, in a department store this week, I was forced to rate my "experience" of transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pull through my credit card.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street, it's the same, plus the option to match the valuation with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the shop table.
This not only leads to a slowdown in what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the department store stood excusingly grinning while I tired of the experience of handing her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius moved from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pistorius has left prison for the second time for a hospital visit.
Last year he was taken to hospital for treatment of cuts to his wrists, which he said he suffered after a fall in his cell, according to prison authorities.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors against an initial manslaughter conviction.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her at her several times through a door of the toilet cubicle at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nightly intruder hiding in the cabin.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius, which they say is too lenient.
The National Law Enforcement Agency said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk of his sentence being increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he undercut women's contacts with the outside world.
The world market price of crude oil rose 52 percent this year - last month the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly $100.
In the Budaörser trade triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has also increased by 16 percent this year, however, price increases of more than 1,000 HUF have been registered in all hypermarkets.
After "davongaloppiert" prices in food markets last December, inflation has not been drastic in percentage terms, compared with the already high, earlier starting level.
Prices for unicum and live fish remained close to the previous year's level, while prices for turkey breast fillets, nuts and poppies rose sharply.
Prices for flour and bread were in line with data from the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but at Auchan there were 1kg of bread wakes for 139 forints.
Also surprising here was the price of a two litre Coca-Cola deposit bottle of under 200 forint, so the drink including deposit cost only 257 HUF.
Our calculations have revealed that Cora has increased prices in the "Napi" shopping cart by 15 compared to Christmas prices last year, while Tesco and Auchan have each increased by 18 per cent.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase was evident, with the price of daily consumables in hypermarkets rising by more than 30 per cent in less than 20 months.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at prices at all.
The price of this car is not exactly popular.
The question still seems uncertain as to the extent to which we can actually act in terms of exchange technology, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at customer level.
The insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that higher contributions are due in the event of a higher risk of accidents.
The cautious drivers can choose a full insurance policy with excess, so that the benefits of full insurance are covered but offered at a low price.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises the price it has to pay for the natural gas, it will charge higher transit fees from Russia.
This led to a fall in exports to Western Europe in a row, pushing up prices sharply.
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
Overall, prices rose 3.0 percent year-on-year.
The draft is expected to be submitted to the General Assembly for adoption during the Millennium Summit and the Heads of State or Government are invited to celebrate the first ever Convention against Transnational Organised Crime at a special signing ceremony hosted by the Italian Government in Palermo in December, together with the United Nations.

If the adoption of one amendment necessarily means the rejection of another, the latter will not be put to the vote.
9. notes with gratitude and satisfaction that, in accordance with the invitation in paragraph 7 of Resolution 55 / 158 of the General Assembly, a number of States have become party to the relevant agreements and protocols referred to therein, in order to achieve the objective of wider adoption and implementation of these agreements;

Articles 1.2 (j), (k) and (l) of the Staff Regulations contain the basic rules governing the acceptance of marks of honour, orders, perks, gifts or contributions from bodies outside the organisation (see Code of Conduct of 2001, paragraphs 46 and 47).
The old Article 1.6 regulated this issue in a provision prohibiting the adoption of any benefits from a government and severely restricting the adoption of benefits from non-government bodies.
With his proposed wording of Article 1.2 (j), the Secretary-General wanted to express his view that the General Assembly should stress the importance of the impression of strict independence and impartiality of staff, and thus reaffirm the absolute prohibition on accepting the benefits of governments.
The Secretary-General will inform all Member States in writing of this principle of organisation on the issue of the acceptance of badges of honour, orders, perks, gifts or grants, in order to avoid such incidents where possible.
This consent is only granted in exceptional cases and only if the acceptance is not incompatible with the interests of the organisation and with the position of the official as an international official.
Accepting such gifts is unlikely to risk undermining the integrity or independence of staff.
Pursuant to provision 101.2 m) of the Staff Regulations, the Secretary-General may exceptionally authorise an employee to accept from a non-governmental body honorary marks, orders, perks, gifts or grants not covered by provision 101.2 j) to l), provided that their acceptance is in the interest of the United Nations and is not incompatible with the position of the employee.

I welcomed the resumption of inspections by the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) in Iraq in November 2002, following the unanimous adoption of Security Council Resolution 1441 (2002).
When farmer Arnold finds an odd egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the fourth-graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released into the holidays and into the secondary schools.
Three of the dismissal students will go to grammar school in the future, four to secondary school.
School principal Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of the school dismissal, the 29 pupils of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle who grows up in the chicken farm but is then released to freedom after all.
The lively crowd performed a musical called "Der Adler im Hühnerhof" (The Eagle in the Hühnerhof).
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and had it hatched by his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chicken, a little eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken out of him shattered, with the eagle spreading its wings on a high mountain and disappearing.
After that, classes three and four showed a chicken dance in Yvonne Frank's enrolment.
The hens danced with the young goggles, who wore cylinders to make the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school principal Angelika Sitte.
The kitten is different from the other kittens (chicks), but belongs to it.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His determination is to be free.
She wished every fourth-grader that he felt accepted in his new school.
It followed thanks to colleagues, former school principal Michael Müller, who repeatedly jumps in on classroom shortages, and the parents' representatives.
The chick season is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She was very reluctant to dismiss her students after two years of teaching, because it was a really great time.
Finally, she was able to rely on the fourth-graders.
At the end all students sounded a song of summer time and holiday time.
Great joy broke out among the children.
Eight first-graders have already registered for the new school year.
"Miss Wyatt," said tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased),"please translate the first paragraph."
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians have been detained for illegal campings in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced, quoted by television.
On the morning of August 1, police arrested a group of illegally camping people in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day they were released while an investigation is ongoing.
The foreign ministry told bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and are imposing substantial fines on anyone found to stay in a place not intended for that purpose.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court can impose a fine.
First, because some young people don't take advantage of these cheap cards anyway, as they wouldn't listen to classical music at any price.
But the Bavarians, unbeaten in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered as 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane collapsed at Mecca's Grand Mosque.
The victim suffered a nasal fracture and was bleeding heavily from the nose.
When his two friends rushed in and appeased the raccoon, he initially let go of his victim.
A 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate who has been missing since Saturday has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The last victim of this sting was a just-starting affair that had been more promising for relieving the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and might even have brought him some satisfaction.
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
I don't feel like I'm a victim, this story is now a part of my past.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus, with more than 600 people falling victim to the fever here alone.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What those affected need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers need to get involved in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars in the Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 emission classes.
Euro 4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have Schummelsoftware," says Anja Smetanin.
The German Federal Motor Transport Agency (KBA) has ordered their retrofitting.
How and from when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced a speedy implementation in the next few months, but have yet to give an exact date.
Daimler has told to write to anyone affected.
If an inspection is due anyway, it will be done within its framework.
How long should the overall changeover take?
"Hard to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on political pressure.
"We have seen that car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the issue of the environment."
How long should the update last?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do motorists who don't drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait and see.
Presumably foreign manufacturers would follow suit, according to Smetanin.
Is there now a threat of a massive drop in the price of Euro 4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
But precisely in the regions where driving bans threaten.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale yet.
Despite advances in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of contracting it.
Especially since the Egyptian people are given an ultimatum by resorting to a hasty vote: "Either you vote for my draft or I keep the unlimited power of attorney," the latter should supposedly end after the adoption of the Constitution.
Petrizki also lived in the camp with him.
Every few hours they took a bath, so it was high afternoon when they returned to camp.
Everything in the camp was drenched, the fire extinguished; for they were reckless drivers, like all their like, and had not taken any precautions against the rain.
All means of getting hot and tired were conscientiously applied, and gradually all the exiles flowed back to the camp, endowed with good hunger, and then the destruction of the good things began.
Ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first awards ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the award winners doesn't want to come - in protest.
Ll Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the prestigious Kennedy Center's coveted awards.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), as well as choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are also among the honorees this year.
The awards will be handed over in early December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the awards ceremony along with his wife Melania.
The award winner Lear, who became known with progressive TV series, therefore already announced that he would refrain from attending the gala.
To the "New York Times," he said: "This presidency has chosen to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even depriving them of the means - and that puts a strain on me."
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed she will use the conversation with Trump to make her view clear.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Previous winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
Our politicians don't understand enough of the sciences, and they rarely seek the advice of scientists and engineers when it comes to solving important problems.
Larger U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have close ties with the Iraqi oil ministry and have been on hand with technical advice in recent years, have gone out empty.
This year, she is a candidate for Chile's National Literature Prize, an award awarded by the government, the Department of Education and the National Council for Arts and Culture.
He is one of 16,000 Egyptians convicted by military courts since the Higher Council of the Armed Forces became the de facto ruler of Egypt.
For a year now, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), the Egyptian Military Council, has been abusing Egyptian women in a despicable though not irreparable way, sexually, physically and mentally.
The government was forced to form a council to write a new constitution: A group of citizens - without politicians, lawyers or university professors - who made the discussion process accessible to all and managed to work out a preliminary proposal by consensus.
In any case, we can already start analysing the list of candidates, draw some conclusions about them and also make forecasts as to who will get a seat in the Council.
At this time, there are 142 registered candidates for the 45 seats in the Council.
Although there has always been a gender imbalance in the protest movement, the list of candidates for the Council reaches a new level of imbalance.
While some opponents criticized the voting process and the results, many (if not most) members of the protest movement have hailed the council as a triumph of cooperation and mobilization.
In the near and distant future, the Council will certainly still often take a position on similarly sensitive issues.
Both Ethiopia and the Council have good constitutions.
Based on the assumption that social stability and peace are conducive to economic activity, a series of dialogues on the role of companies in zones of armed conflict were held in 2001 under the Pact in order to find out how companies within their sphere of influence can increase people's security.

We make the city livable
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city builder, is retiring next year.
The job is already advertised - but suitable applicants are rare.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And the work is still great fun for him, as he conveys in the press briefing.
He reports on varied but also demanding tasks awaiting his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that so far no application meets the requirements profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.
Thus, in compliance with the regular notice periods, there should still be enough time for an introduction.
Since Haslach acts as the Lower Building Authority for the administrative community, the applicant must show relevant qualifications.
Because the city definitely wants to keep this function.
If it were no longer able to fill them in, citizens would have to go as far as Offenburg for advice.
But being close to the citizens is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports a good operating climate as well as good mood between the authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some significant projects have accumulated that Wacker looks back on with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure of the building office and its staff.
But also in the future, varied projects are on the agenda: The transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz, for example, have been initiated.
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the stadium renovation is still an issue.
The latter alone will be worth around 1.5 million euros,"if we get it right," Wacker estimates.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun. "
In terms of design, there is a great deal of scope for a city builder.
With Haslach's own farm and nursery, many things can be reacted to quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," Wacker said, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.
As the Old Town is listed as an ensemble, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, emphasizes the outgoing city builder.
In any case, the city builder bears a high responsibility.
He's a builder,"in the end everything here runs over my table."
He can count on longtime employees for support and coordination: Markus Neumaier (civil engineering) has been there for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) has been there for 15 years.
Also, that his successor remains long, Wacker wishes: "We're looking for someone who really identifies with the post and wants to stay."
Because continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further development of the city.
Anyone wishing to inherit Roland Wacker should, according to the city of Haslach, have completed a degree as a graduate engineer or bachelor with a specialty in architecture and have good expertise in the areas of building regulations and planning law.
The Municipal Building Office is responsible for civil engineering and civil engineering, construction planning, land acquisition matters, management of urban properties, municipal farm with building yard and municipal gardening, as well as the Lower Building Authority including monument protection.

Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to shun meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The lead researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestines patrol to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in the food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far toward inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments found that a type of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: 'We have established a link between a type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal milieus, if the same system also works in humans.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, but housed separately, did not have this.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbiome of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and six species of bacteria were found to be present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment so they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells originated.
To understand how the bacteria impacted the immune system, the researchers let L. reuteri grow in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of the fluid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as Indol-3 lactic acid.
If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans the same way as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: 'The development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially, high tryptophane levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."

Chelsea's £40million signing began with a 2-1 win in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup begins against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched on at will.
However, Matic had been ruled out of the Blues' pre-season Asia tour and managed just 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him be ready sooner rather than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho shaped his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted the club had already done a "fantastic job" of fulfilling three of his four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, for that I thank the club," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've put in a lot of effort."

New low for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader, Social Democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections.
Only no disturbances from the party headquarters, only no headwinds from the federal government - that was the most important wish of the election campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz leads the party, that has fundamentally changed.
Since then, staff from the Willy Brandt House have been watching events in the SPD-ruled state capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described with headwinds in the approach.
It was lows.
One after the other.
The federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and Greens after the surprise end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony.
"This shows once again: Red-green simply cannot govern reliably," CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber told the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprise group exit of a Green MP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the state election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
Greens leader Michael Kellner has called on renegade Lower Saxony Greens MP Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The move to the CDU means a clear falsification of the will of the electorate.
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate,"the Greens' federal executive and campaign manager told the editorial network Germany (RND).
"All this must not be true after all," sighs an SPD election campaigner as the new job message reaches party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD prime minister of Lower Saxony, stands without a government majority of his own after Green MP Elke Twesten defected to the CDU.
It is the provisional culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state federations.
And no one knows what comes next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly emphatic defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no more, comrades calmed down at the time.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.

Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD country chief, lost his nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned.
And because in crisis communication after that, he got pretty much everything wrong that you can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now also Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW exhaust gas affair and his role on the Supervisory Board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been under criticism for some time.
Miese poll ratings added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil has tried more and more in recent weeks to set accents in the covenant.
The former mayor of Hannover's ambition to expand his power in Berlin was not hidden from comrades in the vicinity of Martin Schulz.
They allowed him to be granted, as they promised to stabilize the party from Weil.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
In doing so, Weil is basically not to blame for the party internal strife of the Lower Saxony Greens.
And Schulz certainly not at all.
In the meantime, therefore, the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed.
Her anger is directed at the Greens, and here, above all, the breakaway parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is intolerable and damaging to democracy how Ms. Twesten places her own career interests above the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, head of party leftists in the SPD Bundestag faction, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Ms Twesten was elected to parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but via the Land list of the Lower Saxony Greens, the Lower Saxony MP continued.
The logical consequence would be for her to return her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD's Bundestag faction, laments an "undemocratic maneuver."
"The voter will four years ago was clear: People made Stephan Weil prime minister," Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the frontrunner in the federal election, tells the RND.
"Now the personal career memory of a future CDU MP is falsifying the election result," Oppermann went on to say.
He called for the backgrounds to be cleared up.
I want to know whether there has been more or whether there have been further commitments from the CDU of Lower Saxony.

A paragraph in the resolution tabled by Mr Herman and his party friends, on the other hand, requires a comment on our part: We are surprised that the Commission's proposals are seen as only short-term.
We have voted on the first paragraph of Article 102a), but, as far as I remember, we have effectively not voted on the second paragraph.
It is clear that the House has adopted the first paragraph.
Then this paragraph was voted out by a majority of the committee.
An amendment I tabled and adopted by the majority of the House is recorded in the Minutes as being rejected and, finally, the recital of the original resolution was miraculously transformed into a first paragraph of the main part.
In paragraph III of the last paragraph concerning the Committee on Budgets, the German text again contains the wrong translation.
This paragraph forgets that the Baltic countries are currently part of the Soviet Federation, that their authorities and their peoples know this very well, just as they also know that the rhythm of reforms depends on that of democratisation in the USSR.
I refer here to Article 14, second paragraph.
However, when we analyse this article, we see that, according to its first paragraph, the Member States are trying to promote the improvement of the working environment in particular.
Because of a misunderstanding, 16 members of my group voted against this paragraph, two abstained.
I realise, however, that this would have had no effect on the final result, since the paragraph was rejected by a majority of 55 votes.
Can the Commission say whether it has submitted a report on progress in ensuring social protection, in accordance with the provisions of Recommendation 85 / 308 / EEC (x) on the social protection of voluntary development workers?
You are no doubt aware that the first paragraph of Article 146 of the EEC Treaty, as it stands today, reads: "The Council consists of representatives of the Member States.
Firstly, will the Commission accept this amendment, namely to abolish the second paragraph of Article 6?
Because, Mr President, in every paragraph she mentions the issues of the Kurdish question, the Cyprus problem, torture, freedom of the press and trade union freedoms in Turkey, and this means that there are problems.
Secondly, it is true that the first paragraph of Article J4 of the Maastricht Treaty reads: 'The common foreign and security policy covers all issues relating to the security of the European Union, including, in the longer term, the definition of a common defence policy which could lead to a common defence in due course'.
I therefore hope that the Commissioner will consult with his colleagues over Christmas and ask them to pre-empt my paragraph in the resolution in the new year.
This week started well in the European Parliament, as we discussed, among other things, the Barzanti report, in which the following paragraph summarises the opinion of many Members of Parliament.
That was in the paragraph.
However, if we look at Part II of the Protocol, we see that point 1 is a de facto decision, consisting of three recitals and a reasoned paragraph.
Funding for the town centre III
Those who wish to renovate their old house will soon be able to receive support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives informed Steg Urban Development in Senfingen on Wednesday.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave another look back at what has happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitation areas in Senfingen.
At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding.
In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "success project" - after all, it is important to promote internal development, and not only to develop new construction areas.
On 4 April, the President of the Government of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III.
The amount of funding was EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 would come from the country, the rest from the municipality of Senfingen.
How does a redevelopment area develop?
One will, Schindler continued, investigate where the "really old" houses are.
It also plays a role, however, whether there is any interest in the planned area to be rehabilitated.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could then be shifted again.
The Steg represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday night.
Keller presented the contents of the federal and state program "Social City," in which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of housing and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out object-related, i.e. per plot.
The redevelopment area would then eventually be established as a statute.
The grant period for the funding has been running until 30 April 2026 since 1 January 2017.
Until September this year, however, the inventory would be carried out, in which those involved in the rehabilitation area would receive a questionnaire to fill in.
In November or December, the statutes should be adopted as far as possible, so that the redevelopment can begin next year.
Pietzschmann subsequently explained that each commune had to carry out the said preliminary investigations.
It is a question of assessing urban problems and deciding when to remediate and to what extent.
A renovation note will then be entered in the land register for the respective property.
Pietzschmann, she promised, would come to his senses again and get a picture of the situation.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires which will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled in by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land arc," which deals, among other things, with the structural condition and the renovation intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and housing arc," information on the size, division and residents of a living space can be provided.
The blue "operating sheet" is only to be filled out if business premises are operated in the building.
However, Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new building measures were not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funding works according to the "greyhound principle" - whoever comes first, grinds first.
You can't "reserve" funding for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown in order to make a renovation "tasty."
British inventor sets himself a microchip to get in house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be fitted with a microchip so he can open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had the tiny chip implanted between his thumb and forefinger and is now offering the service to businesses and individuals looking to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has partnered with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant anaesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure the implant procedure is carried out to medical standard.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts just 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's firm also wants to change the locks on homes and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for a surcharge of £300 per lock.

White House ad costs taxpayer thousands
The White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military, which was left to TIME magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to records obtained by the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," the commander of HMX-1 wrote to his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation, on the eve of the event.
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn for the event at 3pm on July 17 about 7am, and remained until the lawn was cleared between 6pm and 9pm that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House were to be delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the restriction on hours of service.
The original flight crew were at the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained on the ground with the plane during the time.
It was not clear from the records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the provision.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds as if you're locked up," the deputy commander replied.
The "Made in America" event was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave a push for health care reform underway in the Senate, and he touted efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for the trip.
But requesting their use only for a photo-op is unusual.
Trump led an investigation in February when the presidential plane provided taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential plane.
"The White House is excited about the" Made In America "show - which features products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials," said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews frequently conduct training flights in the area around Washington and the South Lawn to depose the US president at the White House with precise centimetres.
When Trump was in Germany at the G20 summit in early July, HMX-1 made 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted at the flight crew's training needs for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said taxpayers were not taking on the burden for any of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company had not been involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to hourly rates from the US Department of Defense for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Records from the unit record the plane's flight time as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
"Setting the cost to taxpayers based on the estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, reimbursement rates for DoD do not include staff costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contracting.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present things this week that are made in America," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people depend on it.
And I think like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It's obviously appropriate to highlight that. "
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat down in the driver's seat of a fire truck.
At the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said,"I have three of them."

I only hope that, following this report by Mr Michel, it will finally become clear to the public that it is not a question of promising more money that is simply not available - everyone involved in budgetary procedures knows this - but of calling on individual people to take their own initiative, to make personal use of it.
Mr Michel was one of the most amiable Members of this House, especially because of his spontaneous kindness, in which natural generosity and commitment to the poorest sections of the population combined harmoniously.
The Community is called upon to continue and develop its efforts and efforts in order to ensure the success of this initiative, which is dutiful but still commendable.

How America can hurt OMV

After all, the draft provides for punishing European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Investors in the domestic OMV, which, together with other European companies, is co-financing the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 2, have since been alarmed.
The threat backdrop is massive.
Nevertheless, it is too early to estimate the consequences, according to the oil company's official statement.

Narco's Season 3 trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will take centre stage in Netflix's hit series
Despite the second season of narcos revealing Pablo Escobar's killer, the Netflix series is far from over.
Seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first receiving its first trailer and showing off the show's latest villains.
With season three, the DEA has turned its attention to the richest drug trafficking organization in the world: The Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful godfathers, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more government bribery and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican compound, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type who invites American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs.

Role backwards: City hires 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the Kita lunch table itself.
With fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team.
In the urban nurseries, the clock is turned back.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld will again take over the food supply in the municipal daycare facilities (Kitas) on its own.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of Youth Aid, this is good news: "We were all very pleased."
Cooked outside the house: A caterer takes on this task and delivers freshly cooked chilled.
The city operates 46 nurseries in the Krefeld area, in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunchtime.
Last year, 2800 children each sat at the tables, and the need is growing steadily.
"Meanwhile, not only children who are cared for 45 hours a week eat lunch at the Kita," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer also applies in 35-hour care if children stay until 2pm."
46 part-time workers have kitchen service from September 1: They heat up the food delivered, add salad, raw food and fruit, portioning the meal individually, handing out the food, clearing, rinsing and cleaning the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - decides the hourly range.
"The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the Kita team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"They are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital management to implement pedagogical concepts."
Because that's also what it's all about: Healthy eating and cooking lessons.
"The kids are supposed to help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
Also for the children.
"They have a known force in the Kita, a person familiar to them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the kita rooms - previously also the task of the kitchen staff - will in future be carried out by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has, in addition to improving the quality of kitchen performance, the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical for the city in the cost comparison between self-management and outsourcing, according to the press office.
And that's despite 46 part-time workers being rehired.
"But these hours don't really weigh that much at all in the area of education for around 750 people," says Sonja Pommeranz.
He also fears, like many other project critics, that the intended size of the plant would lead to a sharp increase in traffic: "There will have to be whole bus loads coming, so that will pay off," says Schulz.

Afghan democracy depends on women's political role, UN says
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations mission, said hundreds of women will stand in council elections in the provinces, with three women running for the role of vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.

GMB concern over investment at McVitie factory in Glasgow
A union wants to reassure managers at biscuit maker McVitie about the long-term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company had remained silent about the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which makes Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits alongside other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he had invested more than £5million in recent years.
He added that staff and union representatives would be "the first to find out" if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland urged McVitie's to "raise concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be pushed forward."
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the general site manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply affects our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is heavily focused on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, pay and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie."
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The branch manager at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly to this as we appreciate the continued engagement with staff and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, where some issues were discussed openly.
We discussed with employees that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we continually review our operations - and this applies to all our divisions and locations - to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the legacy of Tollcross as a manufacturing site. Should our operations change at the site, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."
"My uncle Reed is in heaven and can see everything you do and say; and my father and my mother too; they know that you imprison me all day and that you just wish I was dead."
Just two or three days ago, I buried a young child of five years - a good child whose soul is now in heaven.
"Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and praise your Father in heaven." Eve.
And then my soul made the first serious effort to understand what had been put into it in relation to heaven and hell; for the first time I looked around me and saw before me, beside me, behind me nothing but an immense abyss; for the first time my soul shook back horrified, it felt and felt nothing secure more than the one point on which it stood - the present, everything else was a formless cloud, an unfathomable depth - it shook me at the thought to stumble, to waver - and to descend into chaos.
"So you're sure, Helen, that there's something called heaven; and that our souls will go there when we die?"

But then she raised her old lament: "Oh, why did heaven want it so much?
He regretted him, but then he said that in a certain relationship the sick person had to rejoice, for it was the will of the Lord that gave him the opportunity to reconcile with heaven.
The hands folded, she lifted her head and looked up to the sky.

This young, fatherless and motherless brother, this little child, who suddenly fell into his arms from heaven, made a new man out of him.
At the points where these currents cut in the sky, they produce the light; at their cutting points on the earth, they produce the gold...
The creature which stood before my eyes possessed that superhuman beauty which can only come from heaven or hell.
She raised her red and dry eyes to the sky, to the sun, to the silver clouds, which here and there were broken by deep blue triangles and trapezes; then she beat them down, looked around her, to the earth, to the crowd, to the houses... Successfully, while the yellow man tied her elbows together, she uttered a terrible cry, a cry of joy.
It is a death worthy of the wise, which has wavered throughout his life: A death that is not flesh and not fish, like the spirit of the real sceptic, a death that utterly expresses the doubt and uncertainty that holds the middle between heaven and earth, that keeps one in limbo.
The beggars cried, gasped, cursed and soared; and Quasimodo, who felt powerless against so many enemies, trembled for the Gypsy and saw the angry faces approaching his gallery more and more, begged heaven for a miracle and rang his hands full of despair.
You'll find it in heaven. "
As for Quasimodo, who had not stopped fighting for a moment, when he saw this wild escape, he fell down on both knees and raised his hands to heaven; then he stormed away drunk with joy, and rose with the speed of a bird to that cell whose accesses he had defended so boldly.
Sometimes he looked at a kind of narrow plate, formed ten feet deeper from the unevenness of the Steinerathen, with confused glances, and he asked the sky in the bottom of his frightened heart that he might be allowed to decide his life on this space of two feet in the fourth: Should it also take a hundred years.
We pondered together about such works as "Ververt et Chartreuse" by Grasset,"Belphegor" by Macchiavelli,"Heaven and Hell" by Swedenborg,"The Underground Journey of Nicolaus Klimm" by Holberg, the Chiromance by Robert Flud, Jean d'Indaginé and de la Chambre; roared over the "Journey to the Blue" by Tieck and the "City of the Sun" by Campanella.
In Him alone we find peace and comfort and salvation and love,"she said, and began to turn her eyes to heaven, to pray as Alexey Alexandrovitch closed out of her silence.
Of these he knew none except Enoch, who was caught up alive in heaven.
Shortly before, he had known all the names; but now he had forgotten them altogether, especially because Enoch was his favorite figure from all the Old Testament, and a whole long series of thoughts followed in his head to the Rapture of the living Enoch into heaven, to which he left himself even now, while he fastened his eyes on his father's watch chain and on a button only half-buttoned to his vest.
In Moscow, Alexey Alexandrovitch's slowness and indecision, her loneliness, her loneliness, all laid the burden on him.
A heavy thunderbolt came rolling and pounding down from the sky and lost itself in dull rough in the distance.
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar three years ago?
The La Liga side may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after making an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the world record attack?
The sensational approach has fuelled the transfer window in the summer, with the Ligue 1 club poised to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for £89 million last season.
After finishing, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, with PSG offering wages of more than £500,000 a week.
Barcelona are furious at the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalan board insists the club has always been at their best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned about this prospect by the PSG president three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club that wanted to have one of PSG's best players signed.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch any of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to have one of our players sign with them, that's going to have consequences. "
Barcelona appear to have crossed that line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear they would not allow the international from Italy to leave under any circumstances and Barcelona could feel the consequences of that interest by losing one of their price offers for Neymar.
During the day, only the image of the presidential meeting without sound was broadcast in the press room with the message "private session, limited audio."

After an initial three-week job-search course, they received special training.
In Cape Verde, the course for experts in economics has facilitated their socio-economic integration and has provided them with the necessary tools to carry out their professional activities, helping them to find employment or to create a job for themselves.
All participants were not only encouraged to speak in the course itself, but also encouraged to practice what they learned at home and to speak sentences and expressions over and over again.
Each course was completed with a test that was more of a success check for further planning than an exam.
I would like to take part in the course to become a nurse."
A course titled "Racism and Xenophobia in the workplace" was offered for three groups of district administration employees.
This course was aimed at staff with supervisory functions, workers of foreign origin and teachers of the school of nursing professions.
The course should create a positive working environment and help prevent "cultural collisions," ensure that employees know more about each other, provide more information about the agreements of the political parties on immigrant and refugee issues and encourage work within the framework of the local action programmes.
This course addressed prejudices and hostile attitudes as a result of ignorance and provided an opportunity for practice-oriented discussions on xenophobia and racism, with a view to achieving a long-term change in attitudes.
Another initiative is a course at the LO schools on "Introduction to the Danish trade union movement" which aims to encourage ethnic minorities to use the trade unions for themselves.

Analysis of the teaching material available for each course and identification of the necessary teaching material
Against this background, it is not surprising that after taking over the leadership position, he steered the FPÖ on a strictly right-wing course and publicly made anti-Semitic statements.
I would also like to know why the Commission is obstinately continuing its course of completely ignoring this Parliament and choosing not to make a recommendation, as we wanted, but to stick to the directive.
As long as this convergence of ideas and the values behind them is not achieved, we always run the risk that, in the event of a crisis, the Member States will diverge and not find the course of the middle line.
As an alternative, the submarines would be equipped with sensors and other highly technical equipment to detect trawlers and fishing nets, so that the submarines are able to change course in time.
This political shift has meant that the "Boatpeople" refrain from taking a course on Hong Kong and run the risk of steering their rodents to other shores.
We must then determine the course to be taken, because I believe that we must not be too reckless on the path of confrontation.
But we in the Socialist Group too often had the impression that the Commission sometimes fell off course imperceptibly, but always in a negative direction.
If we continue to steer this course in agriculture, we have fewer and fewer farmers around ever larger farms, more and more pesticides, more and more fertilisers, ever greater threats to the environment, while on the other hand we spend money trying to protect the environment.
The troika, which consists of Ireland, Italy and Luxembourg in the field of social affairs, has agreed on an approach which, in our expectation, will make it easier for the Council to keep track of the objectives of the action programme resulting from the Social Charter.
At the moment, we are blindly pursuing a course that will destroy a large proportion of small family farms that have always been guardians of rural nature.
The truth is that although DG VI is steering a course of vertical legislation with its own provisions for each food, DG VI is not directly responsible for food hygiene.
It is the result of a long, joint work with your committees, of debates that enriched the initial perspectives and thanks to which the course has been maintained throughout the five years.
The honourable Member will be aware that the Community and its Member States have repeatedly expressed their concern about the deterioration of the situation in Somalia and called on all parties to pursue as soon as possible a course of reconciliation in the dialogue on the future of the country, so that a solution can be found to the current tragic situation by peaceful means.
The Danish 'no' therefore offers prospects and opportunities to finally put European cooperation on a course that is better suited to the wishes of European citizens.
However, if it is strongly supported by this Parliament, it would certainly be an important factor in persuading the Council of Ministers to take the course that we believe to be the right one.
Even as these difficulties increased, which was undoubtedly the case in the course of our presidency until its end, we were aware that we should not be deterred from our course.
Not all Member States want to follow the same course.
The course was due to take place in Crans Montana in Switzerland, but was moved to Gothenburg in Sweden in simplified form.
However, a currency is likely to become less of a target of speculation if financial and fiscal policies are credible and foreign exchange markets assume that the course of fiscal policy will continue to be conducted responsibly.
The determined and consistent course of Europeans was developed after lengthy discussions with Member States and industry during the course of the negotiations.
This shows, Madam President, that the enduring regime, which is supported by the military in the Grande, is taking a hard line against dissenters, for which we, all 12 states of the European Union, share responsibility, because, although Parliament has sounded the alarm several times, not only human rights, but also fundamental democratic principles, are being violated there.
I fully support my colleague's line here, according to which Parliament's codecision under Article 129d is required for both proposals.
The heavy-handed tanker Europe with 12 captains - one thicker, the other narrower - is not progressing, and it has no clear course.
As the Council's deliberations have not yet been completed, it is not in a position at this stage to comment on the course it intends to follow in this matter.
Now the president can follow the course he has taken unhindered and, as I understood it, lead his team in finding a middle ground.
I would just like to say briefly that this morning, at my suggestion, the Commission adopted an interesting communication on this subject, which, on the one hand, naturally maintains the budgetary stance, but at the same time presents a number of new opportunities that Europe should resort to.
Germany has spared no efforts or sacrifices to achieve this goal, and you will understand, Mr President, that in my recognition, I include Chancellor Kohl, who has stuck to this course with courage and determination.
This report is therefore aimed at all the European institutions, but it is, above all, justified as an internal discussion paper of our Parliament, because it is intended to set the most democratic course for our parliamentary route during 1999.
We are putting the Union on a new course of transparency and democracy in a Europe of citizens.
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV becomes the table leader.
"We need the second goal," Hermann Rieger hissed in the cabin aisle of the Hamburg Arena.
His command will have been similar: Here with gate two!
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro kicked the decisive goal in the ninth minute of the game.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, kicked a goal, Plekanec delivered two subpoenas and Kovalev converted a pass in that victory game, the fourth of the tricolore in six preparation games.
Kovalev scored the victory by scoring the only goal of the entire shootout.

If these banks were to close their doors abruptly, the Swiss economy would be in dire straits.
Despite these limitations, the fact that the continent now counts 19 stock exchanges suggests that Africa has opened the floodgates to foreign investors and companies and is gradually integrating into the global economy.
Competitors from 26 nations took part in the competition, which involved recreating the Brandenburg Gate and dressing it up with plates (tiles) - "tiling," as Liebenauer says.
But this can also open the door to criticism.
Positions at General Motors Overseas Corporation with responsibility for European sales, marketing, planning and trade relations.
Background: The concept of tariff preferences is based on the recognition that it is particularly difficult for countries whose industry is still under construction, i.e. developing countries, to gain a foothold in the markets of industry and to increase their sales there.
Such a market structure leads to internationalisation, because national oligopolies with a stable internal market are looking elsewhere to increase their sales.
Price reductions if agreed sales figures are exceeded: In France, automatic price reductions apply for products whose sales significantly exceed the sales figures indicated in the original price calculation application.
Uniform EC standards also give the European car industry an important competitive advantage over lorry manufacturers outside the Community, because 57 countries are now adopting EC standards in their national legislation, because they have recognised that they are also useful and practicable for their countries; this promotes the sale of lorries and at the same time creates thousands of new jobs within the Community, which we so desperately need, Mr Collins.
It seems to me important to note that in the European car industry all the companies had a record number of years in sales by the beginning of 1980 and that the advance of Japanese competition had been anticipated for a long time, including on the part of the car industry in Europe, which perhaps partly believed that things were still going so favourably without the need for proper effort.
It will exacerbate intra-European competition, because even the Member States of the Community, which have so far tried to impose restrictions on Japanese competition, will very soon find that European suppliers will seek their way into the market of these countries in order to secure the sale of their cars despite the increased Japanese imports.
In view of the increase in milk deliveries in the Community during 1982 and the corresponding increase in butter production, the Commission considers that two types of measures are needed in the short term, partly to ensure a reasonable sale of butter stocks, partly to prevent a further overgrowth of the butter mountain.
As you know, the Community has fallen behind considerably in this area over the last ten years, as shown by its paragraph, which was already moderate at the time.
Both the Subcommittee on Technical Barriers to Trade and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs believe that the noise level of household appliances plays a role in sales and that this problem is solved by competition, the market forces themselves, so that there is no need for legislation.
The Community consumer organisations, like the Socialist Group, have for years tirelessly pointed out that only a move away from sales and price guarantees and a move towards genuine structural policy can put the vehicle back on track.
Such an action could have artificially increased its sales on the world market in 1985, which would undoubtedly have aggravated the already difficult situation on this market.
I am prepared to consider such an abolition at a time when a level of production is reached which is acceptable for internal use and for sales.
Can the Commission say to what extent the sale of unleaded petrol has replaced the sale of leaded petrol in each Member State of the Community?
Everything that serves to increase quality and improve marketing and sales should therefore be supported by us.
The European Parliament has recently decided not to promote intervention measures in these products, but rather market-oriented sales by improving the quality of supply.
Contrary to the hopes of all, but also to the expectations expressed by Norway, sales on the Japanese market did not increase in 1995, and there was even a slight decline.
On the other hand, the Commission promotes the sale of Community rice on the internal market through a cautious export policy.
However, given the different views of the Member States on the promotion of sales in the internal market and, overall, the positions of the Member States on the sale or promotion of alcoholic beverages, I believe that we have a problem here which would make it very difficult to integrate into a common organisation of the market in wine.
This initiative is all the more correct because we already have assessments of the campaigns to promote the marketing of olive oil and fibre - as Mr Fantuzzi also pointed out - whose sales in third countries have increased thanks to the promotion of ad hoc instruments.
In this context, let me stress that I consider the desire for increased sales mentioned in the Fantuzzi report to be positive.
It is necessary for the EU to pursue an active export policy which goes beyond the use of export refunds and which, in addition to existing export refunds, can have a positive effect on the sale of agricultural products.
In the Community, sales of starch and its derivatives are supported by production aid if these products are used in sectors that are not subject to import protection, such as the chemical, pharmaceutical and paper industries.
The concept of tariff preferences is based on the recognition that it is particularly difficult for the countries whose industry is still under construction, i.e. the developing countries, to increase their sales on the markets of the industrialised countries.
The Community considers that this system was at least partly the cause of the very sharp recent decline in Community motor vehicle exports to Greece, while the suppliers of certain third countries have been able to maintain or even increase their sales.
- facilitate the sale on the world market of quantities of agricultural products not covered by framework agreements.
(14) The impact on the Community industry concerned, in particular on those companies that produce a large proportion of brand-free standard goods, was mainly reflected in a decline in production, in sales and market losses, and in a significant drop in prices, combined with significant reductions in net proceeds or rising losses.
- increased sales of raw materials from the ACP countries in the Eastern European countries;
Commissioner CHEYSSCN recalled that the alcohol market in the Community was undergoing a clear decline which, of course, affected sales of rum and other spirits on this market.
Their production and sales increased by 2% from 1981 to 1984.
Compare Community data on production and sales of industrial products;
- compare Community data on production and sales of industrial products; - assess domestic markets; - compare economic sectors; - know the current situation and plan the future of these sectors; - want to be better informed and more competitive.
In recent years, sales of natural gas have broken down as follows:
The paragraph was distributed as follows (estimate 1984):
Sales to households in 1984 were distributed according to the following zones: KWh / year
In 1984, sales on the public network were distributed as follows (preliminary results):
These associations, which are professional bodies subject to civil law, may, under the express condition of not handing out profits (including in the form of refunds) to their members, serve the joint purchase or sharing of agricultural machinery, as well as the collective supply of their members and the collective sale of their products.
Without neglecting the important aspect of raw material supply, a stronger focus on sales and market problems was therefore urgently needed.
The increase in sales of motor vehicles in 1994 led to a slight recovery in the production of the rubber industry, although production has still not reached the 1992 level in terms of value.
The fact that large companies are weakened or even close altogether also contributes to the lively development of small businesses and their share of sales in France from 1980 to 1988 by 10%.
Sales of coal coke decreased in the Community since 1990 from 45 million tonnes to 40 million tonnes. The percentage declines in this period ranged between 3% (UK) and 17% (Luxembourg) in the individual countries.
Sales of coal coke decreased by 1.8 million tonnes (4.4%) in the EU from 39.7 million tonnes in 1992 to 37.9 million tonnes in 1993.
The beef shortage is likely to have favoured the sale of poultry meat, whose prices are relatively low and attractive to the consumer.
A decision under Article 86 required the United Brands Company to abandon the following abusive practices in the sale of Chiquita bananas within the common market: Closure of the market as a result of the ban on reselling green bananas; refusal to supply Danish ripening imported bananas; differentiated sales policy in which Irish, German, Danish, Dutch and Belgian customers are charged different prices; application of inappropriate prices to customers of the latter four Member States.
The main measures introduced in 1972 for the sale of butter and skimmed milk powder surpluses have continued this year; in particular, butter has been sold at reduced prices to certain food industries and consumer groups.
However, the continuing poor economic situation in the second half of 1975 led to significant losses in sales of coal and coke to the thermal power plants and to the iron and steel industry.
The Joint Expert Group, set up following the visit of President Jenkins to Tokyo in October 1977, will continue to examine in detail the conditions for access of Community products to the Japanese market in the sectors where sales could be increased.
On the other hand, sales should also be secured.
(I) either the commissions normally paid or agreed for sales in the Community or the usual surcharges for profit and overhead costs (including direct and indirect costs for sales) for imported goods of the same type or type;
The Community supports the financing of works that help to increase production, reduce production prices or facilitate the sale of the products concerned.
(I) either the commissions normally paid or agreed for sales in the Community or the usual surcharges for profit and overhead costs (including direct and indirect costs for sales) for imported goods of the same type or type;
Tunisia's sales of industrial products are concentrated heavily on clothing and to a lesser extent on spinning materials (over 18% of all exports in 1979), partly due to the spectacular increase in "passive processing" which followed investments by companies from Community countries, in particular from the Federal Republic of Germany.
This could even lead, as is already the case with northern products, to the Community displacing established exporters through subsidised sales on the world market.
Morocco in particular succeeded in redistributing its sales from France and the Federal Republic to the Benelux countries and Scandinavia and, above all, the USSR and Saudi Arabia.
This solution should have the advantage that it would entail a less open obligation on the part of the Community than revenue guarantees or guaranteed / sales on the Community markets themselves.
Since, in most of the cases mentioned, employment has at least the same importance as the effects on the balance of payments, it would be a better way to guarantee sales of reduced quantities, but at higher (possibly intra-Community) prices than in the past.
The ban on minimum prices does not apply to the sale of books, newspapers and magazines or to goods and services subject to specific legislation which enshrines minimum or fixed prices.
They represent a crucial framework of sales and development opportunities for regional production and employment.
For mineral raw materials such as copper, phosphate, iron ore, ACP countries receive project assistance when production and sales are at risk and export revenues are reduced as a result.
The overall concentration in the food production and processing sector is low in terms of sales.
Of course, this programme is not a panacea for European agriculture: In individual cases, however, it can help to open up new sales and income opportunities.
As long as the crisis continues, there are many accusations of protectionism on both sides; this accusation is levelled by lobbies who encounter obstacles to the sale of their products or who fear that their market will be flooded by products that no longer flow into the usual outlets.
Dutch exports, which make up a significant proportion (almost 30% in 1983) of raw materials and precursors, whose sales are particularly responsive to economic developments, could be stimulated in particular by the current stock formation.
This would be a considerable increase in volume, bearing in mind that the forecasts for sales in the foreign markets in mid-1983 amounted to 440 billion m3.
Indeed, it is likely that demand for steel products will hardly increase, which is likely to be reflected in a fairly slow increase in total exports, although sales of the new companies will develop dynamically.
While sales of natural gas abroad tended further downward compared to 1986, exports of finished goods developed relatively vividly despite the strong appreciation of the guilder in 1986 and 1987.
As the ministries continued to control the supply of raw materials and prices and were able to guarantee sales, most company executives were apparently more interested in a good relationship with the apparatus than in claiming their newfound entrepreneurial freedom.
Parliament must also be represented on the Management Board of Europol and be allowed to participate in the election of the Director of that body.
Police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because a car was coming towards him in his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to dodge, touching the guardrail in the process.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was travelling on the B 215 from Stolzenau in the direction of Leese with his VW about 7.55pm.
In the area of the bypass of Stolzenau, a car came towards him in his lane, so he had to dodge to the right.
The Touran driver touched the control panel.
Material damage was caused to the car.
The driver of the oncoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the road accident.
It may well be, according to the accident victim, that the Mercedes driver had not even noticed the accident.
Police are now asking witnesses to the incident, as well as the driver of the polluter vehicle, to contact the commissioner's office in Stolzenau on tel. 05761 / 92060.
Lack of storage and transport capacity and organisational difficulties mean that slurry has to be "disposed of" on geographically favourable agricultural land.
These bookstores exhibit the publications of EUR-OP in a storefront or part of a storefront reserved for this purpose and must have the most important publications of EUR-OP constantly in stock; they must also be connected to an online ordering system to obtain non-stock titles.
The decline in domestic consumption due to economic crisis, the decline in workers' incomes due to unemployment and high inflation and the decline in exports of Greek wines have led to the creation of significant stocks in Crete, Santorini and other areas, for example, after accession to the EEC.
In addition to the 1980s harvest, 115 000 tonnes of the 1980s harvest are still in stock, which could not be sold.
Only one of the speakers spoke of the possibility that his own garden could become a storage place for radioactive waste.
We should be ashamed that we have huge quantities of milk and butter in stock, while in the Third World children are dying of hunger.
He can of course also reject them at this stage, but this would only mean a postponement, because the day will surely come when the Council will be forced to reduce quotas and dissolve the camps.
However, the honourable Member's observation that 50 000 tonnes of last year's harvest are in stock is to be contradicted.
If we continue with our set-aside programme, we will soon have 18 million tonnes in stock.
The Commission claims that the camps are too large, which is not true, because less than nine million tonnes of stocks, not even 6% of annual production, is not excessive, but let us leave that aside.
After intervention purchases, we have 200 000 tonnes of butter in stock, quite apart from the East German stocks, and by the end of this year these stocks will grow to around 270 000 tonnes.
The war will come to an end, and in the camp of the defeated as in the camp of the victors one will take stock.
There are 40 000 tonnes of salmon in stock, which will soon be dumped on the world market.
According to press reports, an old cargo ship is in service in the Saronic Gulf, which eight years ago was converted into a floating laboratory and a warehouse for the petroleum waste from passing ships.
The offers are to be directed to the intervention centres, which have good warehouses and resale facilities.
And now we are being told that the camps are too expensive.
Most of my group supports the rapporteur's amendment that military facilities or camps should fall within the scope of the directive.
The entire warehouse is divided into different rooms.
In principle, it should be possible for Germany, France or England to dump their radioactive waste in a warehouse in Sweden.
The concentration of production capacity enables maximum economies of scale and leads to the abandonment of intermediate production, storage and transhipment sites, resulting in conurbation effects in the production and distribution areas.
Up to the point of individualisation, the number of bearings is kept as low as possible, reducing the risk of storage, storage costs and throughput times.
Concrete applications include: Business people who want to retrieve their fax and email transfers from outside and without special equipment, sellers who want to check whether a given product is in stock without a terminal, and individuals who want to check their bank account by phone.
Development of intelligent storage and handling systems to optimize product quality.
New developments in the field of biotechnology enable novel approaches to reduce quality losses and the development of environmentally friendly storage and handling systems.
- at levels 03 and 04 in direct connection with the warehouse and loading zone (tracts FG.GH.GM and MN): The printing and distribution facilities and the maintenance facilities;
This service takes care of removals, storage (including the warehouses in Overijse) as well as insurance and collection of the stock.
This could not be achieved, however, as the negotiating conference was not able to resolve the differences on certain fundamental issues (in particular on the general scope of the camps, their distribution among the Member States, the details of the participation of developing countries in storage and the price levels at which the camp intervenes by absorption or levy).
The Council decided to increase the monthly increments for the 1981 / 82 marketing year by around 20% in order to take account of the development of storage and financing costs for grain storage and the need to sell stocks of cereals in line with the needs of the market.
This increase, which applies to cereals, flour of wheat and rye and to coarse and fine gries of wheat, was granted within the framework of the objectives of the basic regulation on cereals, bearing in mind the storage and financing costs for cereal storage in the Community and the need to sell cereal stocks in a way that does not cause market disturbances.
Data processing, office, procurement, general maintenance, equipment maintenance, vehicle park, driver, warehouse and archives
The Council adopted this decision in the context of the objective of the basic Regulation on cereals, in order to take account of the storage and financing costs for the storage of cereals in the Community and to allow for the sale of cereals stocks which do not cause market disruption.
Installation of a 300 ha oil palm and 835 ha cocoa plantation on the east coast of the island of Neuirland; construction of a palm oil mill and storage and loading facilities; repair of cocoa processing plants
- the premises for printing and distribution, as well as the rooms for maintenance services, which are located on levels 03 and 04 in direct connection with the warehouse and the loading zone (Trakte FG, GH, GM and MN);
While the staff working in the business premises need a lower level of qualification, those responsible for warehouse management and data technology need a much higher level of education and training.
Stock changes can be determined either as a difference between the stock at the end and the stock at the beginning of the reporting year or as a difference between the accesses to the warehouse and the departures from the warehouse during the reporting year.
Port vehicles, lighters and tugs used in seaports, ferries, fishing vessels, dredging vessels, ships for hydraulic work and ships used exclusively as warehouses, floating workshops, houseboats and for recreational purposes are excluded.
The rapid growth in final demand in some Member States during the quarter has led to a reduction in the camps in France (-1.2% of GDP) in the Netherlands (-1.0% of GDP), Denmark (-0.7% of GDP) and Sweden (-0.2% of GDP), while the latter three have also switched to an opposite trend compared to the previous quarter.
Sales of olive oil from stocks of the Italian intervention centre were repeated; at the end of 1978 there were still around 95 000 tonnes in stock.
Workshops and warehouses They are necessary for mechanical maintenance, boiler work, electrical repairs, etc.
X-Three performs numerous tasks; it manages the warehouse and distribution center; its business premises cover 5.4 ha; it employs more than 640 people, of whom about 240 are responsible for managing X-Three.
"Belgian branches, even if there is no representation capable of entering into obligations for the foreign company, are the seats of the actual management, branches, factories, plants, workshops, agencies, shops, offices, laboratories, shopping or sales outlets, warehouses as well as all fixed facilities which, by their nature, yield."
In particular, the Court wishes to know whether such a purchase transaction exists when the contract of sale has been concluded between two companies established outside the Community's customs territory, but the buyer, a subsidiary of the seller, has a branch established in that area which has the task of ordering the goods from the seller, managing the warehouses and distributing the goods to customers, in particular to distributors for the products sold under the parent company's trade mark.
Value of stocks (in stock) at the beginning of the financial year (excluding animals).
Already collected or still to be collected amount of sales of products in stock at the beginning of the financial year or of products harvested in the course of the financial year.

Therefore, a high elasticity compared to the share of capital inflows in the assets can correspond to a small adjustment of the bearings.
Apart from losses due to ongoing storage, processing and transport difficulties, supply will decline because farmers, who appear to be expecting a further price increase after the increase in government purchase prices in May 1990, are hoarding the grain.
Obviously, the stocks of precursors and intermediate products, which were partially dismantled in the spring, are being somewhat replenished.
For their part, the development prospects for production remain positive, even if they deteriorate by one point (+ 5 versus + 6) and thus reach their July level again, which is undoubtedly related to the slightly less favourable expectations regarding the size of the stock of unsold finished goods (+ 12 versus + 11) (Table 2).

Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.
This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann thinks.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to give rise to discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," said after publication to the German Press Agency that he expected an apology from the former Regensburg Bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as from the Cathedral Chapel Master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or their then false assessment of the events.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticized the use of "double standards" in the reporting of violence in the cathedral patrons.
Regarding the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that they are "disgraceful and shameful acts" that must be punished and prevented in the future; but the "degree of media manipulation," according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, a historian and member of the Italian national bioethics committee, is striking.
"The habit of referring to the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to think that is normal," Scaraffia writes.
Also Princess Gloria von Thurn and Taxis said in the interview with the Bavarian Radio: "You like to go to the church and this is a found food."
She also pointed out that in her youth,"beatings had been a perfectly normal educational means" to cope with cheeky children, like I was one."
They would find it unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
Pope brother Georg Ratzinger also often appeared in connection with the reports of the abuse cases.
Author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the book "My Brother the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages), is quite wrong.
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann,"because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who was commissioned by the Diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment?
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were victims of assault "with high plausibility" between 1945 and the early 1990s, and 67 Domspatzen were sexually abused.
The final report on Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, states: "In summary, it can therefore be stated that in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been used by Domkapellmeister R.
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Still, unlike numerous other defendants, it is striking that many victims appreciated R."s general humanity and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence, even associate positive memories with him."
In the interview Hesemann explains why in his opinion the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen relieves Georg Ratzinger.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence against protection officers at the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
For one thing, many students highlight his "humanity."
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who often became palpable when a Domspatz musically brought no top performance.
How do you, as his biographer, view this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble and read the whole 440-page report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in it at all.
There are just eight pages devoted to him and he is clearly cleared of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the horrific cases of sexual abuse.
The violence excesses at preschool also occurred outside its sphere of impact.
At best, he can be accused of learning about it too late or of not taking initial hints seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."
Thus, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger presents a very excellent testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted," "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and was "always surrounded by grapes from children."
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to outbursts of anger.
He himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for not only cracking chairs and throwing the keyring on the floor, but also distributing slaps and pulling overly cheeky boys by the hair or ears.
To save his honour, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question, the 1960s and 1970s, among parents as well as teachers.
Do you still know such breeding methods?
Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.
I, too, have still experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared with what this report is actually about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and violence at preschool, these are, of course, trivial matters.
One wonders whether it is not more to do with his notoriety and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI that many media just rushed to him.
Many who have never understood him are still working diligently on the Bavarian Pope.
But the truth is: The report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
A great deal has been reported in the media in connection with the report on the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen (Regensburger Domspatzen).
Is Georg Ratzinger also accused in the final report of any involvement or complicity with regard to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
Not a single one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted themselves to the cathedral chapel master.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one concerned deputising for the others,"It was all very embarrassing to me, after all."
The real problem with educating sexual abuse was, and still is, that most victims remain silent out of shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not to a choir leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a professional sense.
How do the Domspatzen students rate Ratzinger's role with regard to the abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: A student interviewed put it this way: "Regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) of all people would have had timely findings and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I think it is... also really absurd to assume that it is precisely him... boys have opened up more forcefully or more clearly or rather than to their parents, boarding school leaders, trust teachers, etc.
That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "
So the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "That pupils affected and / or their environment were entrusted to him beforehand could not be confirmed as part of the investigation."
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger must therefore be acquitted of any complicity.
Nor can he be accused of failing to prevent or display him.
Therefore, there is also no reason to associate his good name with these sickening crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media there was a lot of "violent excesses" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
The former cathedral bandmaster Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Wegschauen."
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, right in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that, in turn, is an abuse of the report.
There is a clean separation: Between the preschool and the grammar school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence and, let us say, other allegations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the Domspatzen.
The whole terrible beating pedagogy, the cases in which boys were literally harassed and maltreated by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly, all took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only got to see the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
On which, as most witnesses point out, the subject of "preschool" was taboo.
One was just happy to have escaped her and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacal" conditions.
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence, even associate positive memories with him."
At most, the accusation of looking away remains.
But despite all the efforts, the report was only able to define two periods in which it was told of the conditions at preschool.
The first time in 1970 / 71, when he just started to establish himself and did not want to hear about the events at a school where he did not work and was responsible (according to the witness), and then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears to the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it, he points out to them "that caning continues to be practiced in preschool."
Even in the face of the threat of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
That was, of course, at a time when there was legal clarity, when caning had long since been banned in Bavaria, too.
Before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as any of us probably still know.
It was also difficult for him to assess where those affected may have been exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
But you also can't say he always looked away.
That is simply not true.
It was only in 1980 that caning at schools was officially abolished in Bavaria, too.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians talk about the "pitfall of anachronism," that is, the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess is right.
But this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorrent at all times, nor to what was perpetrated in preschool in terms of inconsistencies and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond what was then customary.
That's all quite horrible and I'm glad it's finally being worked up.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. slapping his ears and pulling his hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When corporal punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What image of his time in Regensburg has Georg Ratzinger reproduced in the conversations with you for the book "My brother the Pope"?
Did the subject of caning also come up?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective that the Domspatzen played only a minor role.
Nevertheless, I do not conceal the fact that he led a strict regiment there.
But this also has to be said: Without this perfectionism, without demanding unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world-class institution out of the until then more nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and candy alone, you don't turn recalcitrant boys into great singers and face every success, no matter what field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger talking about her book?
Michael Hesemann: By working on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced him again and again as a wonderful, humorous, basic kind, deeply believing and heartfelt person, of whom one cannot imagine that he could even do something to a fly.
I regularly get to know how many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his retirement, keep regular contact with him, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.
So those who do not forgive him to this day that he was once strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Most of the Domspatzen are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music to them.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also an adorable respect person, to whom they still look up today and whom they almost worship.
And please, again very clearly: All he is accused of are educational methods that were commonplace at the time.
We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.
But it is highly unfair to make a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother, a media scapegoat.
The evil intention behind it is all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves it.
Now the decency would command to finally leave in peace a 93-year-old man who has earned great merits and without whom no one outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany would know the Regensburger Domspatzen.
