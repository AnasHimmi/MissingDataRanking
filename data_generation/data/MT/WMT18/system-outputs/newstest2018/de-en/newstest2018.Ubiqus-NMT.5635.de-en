Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A false institution where young people are to meet today.
A gravel chapel where is now digging for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Kleingtners manage the former land of farmers.
Munich's oldest official map reveals exciting stories.
It's annoying when maps aren't up to date.
This is familiar to anyone who has had to get upset because the car navi displayed a green meadow instead of a bypass.
The historical maps of the digital Bavaria atlas, an offer by the Geoportal Bayern of the State Government, are far from up-to-date - but for that very reason very revealing.
Especially when compared with current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and towns in the spread area of the Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bavaria Atlas is a patchwork quilt that cannot be immediately recognized as such.
More detailed maps, so-called primordial position sheets, were incorporated into the large map.
According to the Bavarian surveying administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originated from the first survey of Bavaria.
Her client: Napoleon.
The French Army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - for military purposes, of course.
Even though French troops finally withdrew with the Lunéville peace of February 9, 1801, it was today's neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map.
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued to drive the project forward, establishing the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian surveying administration.
The original position sheet for Munich dates from 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian National Library.
The comparison between earlier and present is most impressive in the example of the provincial capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was congregated as a Munich district 21 years after the map was created, in 1877.
Today Untersendling is in the middle of the city.
The houses Untersendlings concentrate around 1856 along present-day Plinganserstraße, which was only named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers' uprising against Austria in 1705.
Where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a small-part map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered hallways from the so-called "copying" from which the land tax was derived.
Small plots of land no longer occupy farmers there today - but gluers of the plant "Land in Sonne".
A large green area looms north of Untersendling.
Theresienwiese, the site of Oktoberfest since 1810, was actually still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the original position sheet, in the area of the current district of Au-Haidhausen, you can read not only the street name "at Gasteig" or the hill "On the air" - but also in large letters "Irre Anstalt".
Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße people were once locked up with delusions.
In 1858/59 the Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt "On the Auer Llüen" was founded.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - the psychiatrist brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and, for example, ended up chaining the so-called lunatic.
He has also banned staff from using force against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen museum, which has been working on the institution for an exhibition.
For 280 patients, space was initially available, and later expanded to 500 places.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circle-irresort in Haar 1905.
The Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of Germany’s largest psychiatrists, has been located there since 2006.
In the area of the former Auer Anstalt young people meet in the Munich Salesianum.
The Order acquired the complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training establishments.
To the west lies the football pitch of TSV München Ost, to the east residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - an architectural reference to the origin building of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed in World War II bombings.
Marienplatz was listed as the " Haupt Platz" around 1856, while Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The Allies' bombs tore many holes into the city centre in December 1944.
A large one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a Middle Ages chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work will take place and on April 5, 2017 the spades for the second S-Bahn line will take place.
The slider compares the old Munich map with today's aerial image - and fills the hole at the Marienhof.
He reports that those waiting in queues for the security check repeatedly ask what the problem is and receive the response from security officials “There is no problem.”
By and large, it ran smoothly in most places, though it was also quite inefficient in the hospital - people dug in a long queue."
I left the polling station at 17:00 and the queue was about a kilometre long.
A snake in front of a Takoyaki shop.
Ahmad Shuja uploaded a photo on Twitter showing people in a long queue to get their voting card.
At some polling stations in Malawi, the queues were so long that people at the end of the queue could not see the polling station.
"Today the snake is long," she notes while she goes.
Normally there is an extra snake for the students.
"And they closed the queue for the students, but that's important," Vicki continues, ignoring Arlet.
Civil rights group releases travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning for colored people traveling to Missouri because of discriminatory policies and the state's racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling through the state, as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are noted here," the group's opinion reads.
A recent Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
"They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten up or killed," the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such frequency that we haven't heard them yet."
It is the first such warning issued by the organisation for a state in the US.
The group cited incidents such as racial offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year after he had no gasoline during the trip through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Attorney General of Missouri showing that black motorists in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than whites.
"The recommendation is that people be aware and inform their families, friends and associates about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be prepared whether to bring bail money or let relatives know that they are travelling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, which ranked the state 16th in terms of the number of such injuries.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to the ACLU, will help further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department to other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure in response to specific laws and trends within the U.S.
There are about 13 establishment centres in the North-West Frontier Province, and 30 other camps are in Baluchistan, but they are smaller.
We must stop looking at the problem from the point of view of participation or non-participation and therefore move into one of the two opposing camps.
At the moment, in southern Afghanistan, logistics camps, rolling transport and the development of international airports are creating the military conditions for dealing with Baluchistan and reaching the Indian Ocean.
Hospitals and police clinics, as well as camps near the border, have been looted.
There are United Nations camps guarded day and night.
The Israeli Government assured the presidency that security measures around Palestinian camps would be strengthened.
By reopening the camps, by cracking down on ordinary people's homes by the police and with mass arrests in the early hours of the morning, the regime wanted to react brutally, in our view scandalously, to the growing discontent and popular anger at the difficulties and economic failure of the regime.
This organisation has limited responsibility for helping refugees living outside the camps.
Indeed, we know of countries where there is a kind of revolt around the camps, because the local population feels that the refugees in the camps are better placed than they are.
Their camps are being bombed.
They preserve, as memorials and symbols, the camps of torture and the workshops of death.

This puts it in the grip of the brakes on European development, of those who see strengthening the EC as a provocation to Moscow and Eastern Europe, which is a very regrettable development.
We welcome everything the Commission has done and I am sure the Commissioner will insist on a thorough investigation of the camps when he visits the camps.
Many were killed in resistance, while others fled to camps in adjacent Papua New Guinea (PNG), but even there they cannot feel safe.
I agree with the honourable Member on the importance of maintaining concentration camps for future generations as evidence of Nazi crimes against humanity, but I believe that the sites of several camps have already been placed under the constant protection of the competent national and local authorities for the reason mentioned by the honourable Member.
I visited a camp other than Mrs Ewing: a camp with 97 000 refugees on the border with Somalia, which was run by non-governmental organisations, the European Community and other donors.
Without naming names, I would like to say that there are two camps in the 'no' camp.
However, it seems that various of these camps are under the constant protection of the competent national and/or local authorities.
I thought that the old left and Rousseau's utopia had long been buried, responsible for the millions of deaths of the Gulag and the camps of Communist China.
Parts of the population are deported to camps in the Arab north, with the sole aim of depriving the people of the Nuba of their Christian faith and culture.
The Community and its Member States have also condemned the existence of detention centres, particularly in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and have called for the camps to be opened up immediately for international inspection and disbanded as quickly as possible.
This can also be blamed on the Lebanese Government, which, by refusing to allow the deported Palestinians into the country and refusing to allow aid organisations to enter the temporary camp, has no other objective than to exploit the matter for political purposes to the detriment of Israel.
For several weeks, after discovering the camps, we've been discovering the rapes.
This attention and financial support must not be limited to the camps located in the territory of the Community, but also, if not above all, to the camps located in the rest of Europe.

Weidezaun project is fundamental
The Fischerbach Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year.
The CDU members Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have got a picture on the spot.
At the Schwendemann family graveyard, representatives of the Fischerbach CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.
Markus Schwendemann first provided insights into his farm, in which he farmed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplied 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and housed in five apartments.
"Black Forest milk" is for him the alternative-free marketing route for the milk of his cows, according to Schwendemann.
The table of holiday guests is exclusively regional.
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he called the grazing fence project "elementally important."

In 2003 he took over the parental operation and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if it does not run a bio-farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The Commune has recognised the importance of the grazing fence project and is pleased with the Leader funding."
Farmers would have to be supported at a cost of between EUR 3000 and 4000 per hectare.
It is hoped that the afforestation of the land could be dragged out for a while.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how to continue their operations," the mayor stressed.
Farmers often face criticism for promotion
A total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were fenced off in 2013 through pastoral support.
The open area thus covers 40 hectares, which must not be replanted until at least 2023.
Of the total costs of €71,500, half was funded through Leader, a quarter carried the municipality of Fischerbach.
This left farmers EUR 12 610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of grazing fence.
"The big advantage is the durability of the fences," Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You're doing a really good job without farmers and rural women it's not."
For Peter White, too, it was clear that "best food is produced here."
The Landscape Care Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows state support for grazing fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
The condition is the presence of a conveyor belt called the LPR.
Moreover, the fenced area must not be allowed to be dumped (in excess of 35%) and must therefore be threatened with afforestation.
At present, the request of eight participants with 24 plots, who would like to build a fence of just 16 kilometres, is under way for the Fischerbach Weidezaun project in 2018.
The open area corresponds to 35 hectares and the calculated cost is more than EUR 112 000.

Now Trump’s White House takes the Statue of Liberty
The surest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking statues.
Americans appreciate this as much as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN over the president's proposals to slash legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had done so.
But he attacked their importance, and in particular the importance attributed to it when Emma Lazarus's famous poem was added to his base in 1903, 17 years after the monument's completion.
As Miller Acosta quipped, "I don't want to dwell here on a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is...a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem to which you refer was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, it's not really about history.
It's about contemporary resonance at the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones where a state invites not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tiredness, your poor, / your afflicted masses who yearn to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "elending waste" was better seen on our screens.
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's US.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural clash: It is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to base her words after her death - knew very well that she was doing a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed that meaning: In her poem, the female character is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of the exiles.
Linking the poem to the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the statue's meaning, people from the right wing wanted to change it back a long time ago.
The great screamer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not inviting anyone, but rather an early neo-conservative, bringing the American flame to the nightly world: "Lady Liberty is going ahead.
It is meant to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not open the way to the United States."
Quite unusually, Limbaugh has come across something here.
The significance of the statue is entirely a matter of the point of view of perception.
Lazarus's great fanciful deed was to see her as seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.
And that, of course, is not the perspective Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not intended to clear the way, but to ignite hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the Team of Britain
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the team of Britain
The UK's performance director of athletics, Neil Black, says the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Cup squad "will make a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing" in Scotland and the UK's athletics needs to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," Black said.
"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.
British Athletics: It has something to do with what they did.
And also with the type on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant."
Several of Scotland's athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000m track, while Eilidh Doyle has been elected team captain by the team.
"Eilidh is pretty modest.
Their captain's speech was unbelievable," says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh brought naturally were great."
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete at the 400m hurdles in her fifth World Cup, says it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's best overall number of athletes at the World Cup was seven achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Mid-range runner Muir leads along this path and set five British and two European records last year.
She will attend the 1,500m and 5,000m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500m, is another Scot to watch after a great season that included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "hugely proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and finals.
"The special thing about being team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and voted for me makes it something very special for me," she added.
"Obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots who are part of the team.
It just shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise to podiums.
As for my speech as captain?
Yes, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home World Cup.
So it's really important to rely on this home support and benefit from being back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such a great atmosphere out there."
Key to the site was our desire to create an audio platform that provides a space for emerging talent from the most diverse areas in the region.
Overall, the European Parliament supported the harmonisation proposals by a large majority, even though some of the victims were requested by stakeholders and certain derogations from the usual policy in some Member States, because it was clear that without harmonisation of cost factors and legislation, no great progress can be made towards greater freedom of movement.
The need, the benefits and the gradual implementation of such a project must be recognised and felt by everyone, so that the attacks and necessary sacrifices are made on a voluntary basis.
But how can we ask our peoples, our voters, to make these sacrifices when the same voters read daily in the newspaper about such human rights violations?
Nevertheless, I believe that farmers are prepared to make these short-term sacrifices so that the health of the people can be improved in the long term.
Mr Berkhouwer pointed out how bitter this is for the athletes who have made sacrifices for years to take part in this event.
This is not about refusing to make a sacrifice, but about the impossibility of returning to the constituency on Monday morning.
The hangings of Tunis have not died otherwise if their victim launches a legitimate charge against the Bourguiba regime, this spear of the so-called free world, and if they are confirmation of the need to oppose human rights violations wherever they occur.
They are certainly words that she said with the feeling of a woman, a democrat, an anti-fascist campaigner who knew the victim.
This is demonstrated by the deployment and sacrifice - including to human beings - to which some of the nine have been prepared and are still prepared for this country and its people by placing contingents of troops on the UN peacekeeping forces.
Convincing credible values also means convincing others that, if necessary, they are prepared to sacrifice for these values.
In view of this situation, it seems logical that, in return for the sacrifices demanded of milk producers, a co-responsibility levy should also be imposed on fats of vegetable and maritime origin imported into the Community under preferential conditions.
This also explains the heroic sacrifice of Bobby Sands, O'Hara, Hughes, MacCreesh and, sadly, Joe MacDonnell, who died yesterday after sixty days of hunger strike, enjoying the consent and support of Irish Catholics and much of European and global public opinion.
That means the word 'victim'.
Our vision demands some sacrifices on the part of the rich.
The Olympic champions from many countries who bravely made an enormous personal sacrifice also believed that the Community would keep its promise.
The fact that we ourselves are making heavy sacrifices is no use if our competitors use them for their own growth.
And the success of the Camp David agreement just shows that, for the first time in history, the military victors have made material sacrifices to bring about peace.
This action, let us say, will demand great sacrifices, particularly from the people and workers, sacrifices which must appear to be hated if they do not clearly find their justification in the efficiency of installations and a sufficient balance between surplus and deficit in production and consumption per capita in each Member State.
Thirdly, account must be taken of the great efforts and sacrifices made by Luxembourg since the beginning of the steel crisis, in other words since 1975, to restructure its steel industry.
Enlargement would pose a dramatic threat to the Spanish fishing industry and even this sacrifice would not prevent our production capacity from being significantly reduced.
A great deal of concern has been expressed about the fact that sacrifices - because victims were finally demanded - should be made evenly by farmers in all countries.
We say quite categorically that we are not standing back to the wall and do not need to impose new sacrifices on small and medium-sized farmers; things are different.
The Agriculture Ministers were realistic and I know that all our farmers will be prepared to make some sacrifices to promote the long-term viability and stability of the common agricultural policy.
However, the victims must be distributed equally among the Member States, and I firmly reject the idea that British farmers should be worse off than their European counterparts.
Bearing in mind that we must all participate equally in the happy and unpleasant events of the Community and that it now requires sacrifice if the economy is to be relaunched, we accept the price increases proposed in the Woltjer report.
The Members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats even go so far as to demand a fair distribution of victims in the resolution they have signed with others.
We must also remember that if the democratic parties of Europe had been vigilant and determined, the sacrifice of so many might not have been necessary.
However, these efforts must continue for a while, otherwise all the sacrifices that have been made so far, particularly in the workplace, would have been pointless.
A civilised state must avoid the sacrifice of the innocent.
The economic losses, the number of human victims in the fight against fire, the costs are so high that they can no longer be borne by individual communities, by the Autonomous Communities, by the municipal and municipal authorities, causing serious economic shocks.
Of course, the reduction mentioned has affected several important parts of the programme, including, in particular, aviation research.
It would therefore be unfair to remember only one part of the victims and not mention the other part.
Everyone who has a little common sense now knows that you have to be able to compromise and make sacrifices if you live together too twelfth.
Through this sacrifice, they effectively managed to shake international conscience and unleash a wave of solidarity with the Afghan people, which is now culminating in this victory.
But in the name of what objective are we demanding all these great efforts, all these upheavals, all these sacrifices?
In line with these efforts, producers outside the Community should make similar sacrifices if a more stable balance is to be struck on world markets.
The Polish people, who have been suffering for years from the shortage and scarcity of basic products, have just embarked on an ambitious recovery process and economic reforms which will require further efforts and sacrifices for this courageous and patient people.
The families of the Sellafield workers are now being asked to make an extreme sacrifice.
Only then will all European soldiers whose blood, as invisible ornaments for the victims of the past, have netted the door threshold of every house in this area and have drowned every parcel in fields, meadows and gardens, only then will all these soldiers killed in battle be able to rest in peace!
On the contrary, they would increase social and national sacrifices, especially for the most vulnerable nations.
They worked generation by generation and made heavy sacrifices.
I am told that each country must make sacrifices in order to build a well-organised, integrated and efficient community, both small and large.
Pakistan is a country that has already made great sacrifices in the Afghanistan war, with the reception of millions of refugees.
In addition to these very general plans, we should not forget that there are special cases, such as the case of Poland, which as a whole, by being the first to embark on this process of democratisation, and which were prepared to make sacrifices for it, has already become the object of demonstration of what our world policy will be and what our true intentions are.
Parliament should approve measures which the United States conciliates, but which demand a great sacrifice for the European farmer.
The sinking of fishing boats by submarines can be avoided, and I urge the Commission and the governments of the Member States to come to an immediate agreement on appropriate procedures to ensure that the 'Antares' crew was the last casualty our fishermen made during the Cold War.
We knew war was the victim in politics.
I believe that the Council must ensure that something is done for the minorities that remain, including in a smaller Yugoslavia; in particular, the victims in Bosnia-Herzegovina also need attention.
The one-net rule proposed will impose different hardships and sacrifices on fishermen in different regions and waters that will not be fair by the bank.
While this is a unique achievement in the history of international maritime shipping (thanks to the self-sacrifice of the crew and the sound coordination of rescue operations by the captain in exceptionally difficult weather conditions, there was not a single victim), deliberate slander was guided by low motives of unfair competition.
We will all have to make sacrifices in our way of life, in production and in consumption.
Secondly, we need to strengthen the principle of safety and the protection of the environment, to raise standards and European and international controls throughout the cycle, from shipbuilding to ports and shipping; this is essential in order to halt the negative spiral which, in recent years, has led to an ever-increasing number of major and more serious accidents, and to prevent fierce competition, which is increasingly the victim of quality and safety.
That is why both the Moroccan authorities and the Moroccan public have used their association with the Community as an essential element in their internal political debate, precisely because it enabled them to 'sell' their own people, so to speak, because it is necessary for a more stable and better future to accept these victims.
I wish governments would set an example to those people who show more commitment and sacrifice in the face of such a human tragedy.
However, the question is whether we have the means to achieve our objectives and whether we have the courage to explain to our respective populations what sacrifices they must make so that we can use sufficient resources to achieve our objectives.
Of course, the necessary restructuring cannot be driven by selfishness, but by a clear Commission position so that the victims of the social partners and the investment efforts of recent decades will not have been in vain.
In my country, beef is the most important agricultural export product - no other product has this significance - and because we export 80% of our total beef production, the whole GATT issue carries enormous weight for us, and it is quite certain that we have to pay it beyond the sacrifices already made in the CAP.
The restructuring of the market and the balance between supply and demand are to be found in the restriction of production, even if this solution is difficult in view of the associated sacrifices.

Block critics over Facebook: Don't run for public office if you can't cope with heating up voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to beat him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.
He chimed in at the criticism, surely.
But he did not silence his critics.
For in 1783, Washington said, "Free speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, we are slaughtered like sheep."
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's staff have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union therefore sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Well, and?"
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state who is surprisingly popular.
He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in running his state and strict adherence to principles.
He was also very adept at using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his constituents and playing down his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
So blocking people who come to the governor's side - which is a public forum called official and paid by staff with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people swinging the whip online.
The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not a troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profound.
The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn't hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the commentary section of the news program "The Post."
"I also don't appreciate this idea, if a number of people take a stand on the same subject, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognised as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor's aides called a "focused spam attack," others would probably call "advocacy."
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or erasing a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if the same thing had been done, that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or to arrest and silence protesters.
But that is exactly what is happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for embezzling Facebook and other social media outlets.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on the issue fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
At the time of Washington, the period of affordable postage had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers struck at his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers that turned down Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his position on Amity's contract, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to historical documents collected by the George Washington Project's online papers.
But he didn't silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse form the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
A week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks said that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley-owned shares at the single price of $25.25, yielding a total of $3 billion.
The assumed price is less than 19% of the share price as of August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will see it secure a 10 per cent gain and resold at a price of $31.25.
The last few weeks have been tough for the group, which has seen its stock market fall by half as the price of insolvency insurance soared.

With the dense smog burning in the throat and laying like a blanket over China’s larger cities in a few days, improving air quality in China is one of the most urgent environmental concerns.

Ronan Rafferty hopes to house comfort at Renaissance Club
Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comfort over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
Nordire, who led next-to-last at Archerfield Links until the final round before losing to Paul Eales last year, is linked with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen the Renaissance Club built and we see how it reaches its fame with this event," Rafferty said.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he's in a terrific condition.
Jerry did a terrific job when he set that place.
He's a keen believer in this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although in his 32-year career he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"It really feels special," said the player based in Southport.
"I haven't been able to defend the Extremadura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it.

It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year, returns to action on home soil.

"You want to do well, but you also feel that extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I played solid golf.
I am pleased with the way it has gone."
With the trio on the field are former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
It rarely uses pot.

In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.

In addition, Papua has timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papuans, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 investigation in The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.

"The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura for work.
"It cost the indigenous Papua - the mumma [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised during his 2014 election campaign to address the inequalities and violations of justice in Papua.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's 29 districts - including Paniai - on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua little has changed and today the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
Indeed, just two months after Jokowi’s inauguration in October, Paniai hit a low.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside and singing Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorbike.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offense to her tone and later came back with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had been drinking jammed and beat the group with their rifles, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the children's group.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - in circle running and imitating a bird song - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began throwing stones at police and military posts.
As the mood heated up, the soldiers were sent a command via an internal radio: "When the crowds resisted more than three times, they shoot them dead," according to an official document from TIME, which was not released to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of Enarotali's Kego Koto district, saw the threat and called for calm and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, a lot of shots were fired," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran toward him and looked at his body to make sure he was," said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, has only one name bearing TIME in grim mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The Papua police's chief inspector, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because it was being attacked.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua police spokesman, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, said in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
News of the killings only came the following day 'filtered' to Jakarta.
Three weeks ago Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and vowed to tackle the historical grievances in Papua.
"I want this case resolved immediately so it won't happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an out-of-court mechanism to resolve historic human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to go through," he said.
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME on June 5 in Jakarta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, everything "is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, whom the UN has accused of "crimes against humanity" that left more than 1,000 dead in East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights abuses in Papua had already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims took such claims with grim disbelief.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress whatsoever," Yohanes says.
'I'm tired.'
He says years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I am afraid of being arrested by the military, I fear being shot."
His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I had buried the corpses, the military searched for me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's neighborhood of Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring an unconscious man to hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned when he fished in a nearby river, died on his way to hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company's office.
Police said villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began firing on the crowd, killing one.
"We were so panicked, we were afraid there was going to be revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here, according to TIME.
"I was hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for withdrawing the police's mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a troublemaker for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the dissatisfaction of the tribesmen Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the Green Highlands of Papua.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend Papua's rights by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years on the pretext of "safeguarding national sovereignty."
Some never resurface.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty reinforces discontent.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here build everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the responsibility of women, who can each process four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They keep most of the crop for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost just 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between native Papua and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region typically go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely has the capital or skills to run its own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because here there are no jobs or money," says John Gobai, the chairman of Paniai's tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
Moreover, restrictions on reporting to international media remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, despite being given rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi's campaign to lift the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: Visa refusal and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua including the Paniai shootings.
The same countries have historically supported OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's allegations and told journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there is free media so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and urged him "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papua officials say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, the Paniai people are in poor educational and health services.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, regard their vote for Jokowi as a "debt" he must repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims performed a last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with a lowered head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire captures Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper for second time
A fire took place Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-metre-high, 79-storey building.
It is the second fire to sweep through the high-rise in just two years, which is coincidentally called the Torch-Tower (Fatile Tower).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported and there was no direct word on the cause of the blaze.
"We slept and we stood up at the fire alarm and shouting people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said firefighting units at around 4.00pm local time (00.00pm GMT) extinguished the fire and cooled the building.
The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected.
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used in exterior areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the lining, the outer lining to decoration or insulation.

No Davis Cup reform: Continue best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has fallen through with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup individual only on two sets of wins was razor-thin not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-sentence classics, which are often very long but also very much appreciated for this reason, therefore remain the traditional one.
63.54 percent of member countries voted for the reform, so ITF President David Haggerty’s goal was narrowly missed.
"We respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic contests," Haggerty said.
We will continue to work to improve the competition.

About Graham Greene: "Our man was captivated by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in whose flesh the emotions of adultery combined with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of coming to heaven on the path of destruction."
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that, a few days before the attack, several thousand dollars had been sent from Catalonia through a money transfer company, which were 'invested' in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the 'command' which ended the lives of 106 people.
As is generally known, the two players lost time a few minutes before game time (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead their group, the two players will meet the required sanction at the next league game against the Auxerre and so enter the next phase without any cards.
The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice; it is more common in the world of football.
The advantage, obviously, is that players begin the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.

Some 26 million Visa cards already have this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.

He asked K to offer him a blanket from the canapee.
K. picked up the ceiling and said: »They unnecessarily opted for cooling.«

In a small, dirty room, whose painted wall panel was argly full-blown and through its thin wall one could hear a conversation next door, in an air filled with the suffocating smell of unclean things, lay on a bed covered in a blanket.
The one arm of this body was above the ceiling, and the enormously large hand, similar to a harke, was inexplicably attached to a thin, long floor, which is equally strong from the beginning to the middle.
It did not make him mind to see all the details in the condition of the sick, to think about how this body was lying under the ceiling there, what curved posture these outstretched lower legs and hips and this meagre back were stored there, and whether it was somehow possible to store them better, to do something so that the sick, if they were not actually better off as a result, did not have such a bad thing.
The wheelbarrow was brought up, the body placed on it, wrapped with a blanket and tied with knitting.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. travelers bring banned items to the plane, a survey finds
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 percent intentionally or unconsciously smuggled items past the checkpoints of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent who boarded the plane while inadvertently carrying prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 per cent claimed they had belatedly discovered they had gone wrong with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers are more likely to disregard the rules.
Of those surveyed who admitted they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 per cent were millennials, compared with less than 15 per cent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items deliberately passed to TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 per cent admitted knowingly carrying items with blades through the security check, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also confirmed they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the plane.
The company said it interviewed travelers across the country to find out how many had inadvertently brought contraband through airport security and how many had done it deliberately.
It's no surprise that the people most likely to carry contraband - knowingly or unwittingly - through security were the ones most likely to fly.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure what liquids they are allowed to carry with them or how much of it.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of the items seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA could view books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Electro-thousandsassa Elon Musk is happy to give with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3."
In doing so, he has so far suggested that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the always triumphant figures on sales growth and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, revealed for the first time a different, less shiny figure in announcing the latest quarterly results: the cancellations of the new mass-market model 3.
Musk has frequently advertised in recent months with the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: Of the total 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are merely non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will pay back the 1000 euros (US$1000 in the US and £1000 in the UK) "reservation payment" in full.
There are currently 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk conceded in a conference call with analysts.
However, the Tesla chief does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders so far could become a problem.
His argument is that the challenge to ambitious growth targets is not demand, but production.
Last year, Tesla supplied 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, it is expected to be - all models put together - 500,000, and one million in 2020.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
Anyone who orders a "Model 3" today must expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand-new, never-before-tested production roads without major disruptions with maximum capacity utilization.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
If there are major delays, however, the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent unhappy customers from running away in droves.
EPA chief Pruitt withdraws because of delaying Obama-Era rules on reducing emissions
A day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of the Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency proved more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the lawsuit, which had been filed against his previous spot in a federal appeals court.
At issue is a deadline that expired on October 1 for states to meet 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's prosecutor before his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry oppose.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback to the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when trying to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In an opinion issued Wednesday night, Pruitt suggested that his U-turn on ozone standards simply reinforces EPA's willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indicted by activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We don't believe in regulation through litigation and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and authority that we have."
Still, the EPA's opinion said that Pruitt will eventually use its "authority to delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules are "based on sound policy and the best available information."
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is expected to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who headed the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal -- following our lawsuits -- is a significant boost to the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia in this case.
Ground ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere respond to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered on Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It's disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the Trump administration's ideological crusade to bid to polluters and their particular interests."

Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade at 16.30 on Sunday, July 16.30.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the town, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth charity serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
Saving and preserving the oldest building in the village has made Tumlingen's friends and patrons their concern.
Walter Martini stresses: "It's a unique village gem."
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the Württemberg Documentary: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church on it to Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silber.
According to the wording of the document, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a stately court on the Tumlinger Berg, which included the church or the right of patronage and not the other way round.
So people lived there too.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt from 1858, besides the Unterdorf and Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "Berg" was the third, the stately centre of the village.
Old maps dating back to 1600 underpin these historical realities.
The patronage law originated from the early Middle Ages right to own churches.
A gentleman who built, furnished and occupied a church remained the owner of this church and was able to inherit this own church.
This meant the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
Three altars were in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two crumbled on Christmas 1673.
The newly acquired bell first sounded in 1692, but had to be delivered later in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648), the windows were knocked down and the bells were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius Cemetery also served as the final resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and Hilariuskirche aborted.
Only the church tower was left standing.
In New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was aborted.
Only the tower, which still exists today, remained a witness to 750 years old church history.
Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are now caring for the Hilarius facility by the "creative pensioners" in place of Dieter Dockhorn.
As an organizer, the friends and patrons of Tumlingens invite to the sixth serenade at the old cemetery of St. Hilarius Chapel on Sunday, July 16.
This is created by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local Hartmut novels speaks the final word.
The programme starts at 16.30.
Admission is from 15.30.
For the end of the serenade, a roundabout takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with the wide view over meadows towards the forest," organisers put out the fantastic views.
The Serenade only takes place in dry weather.
Organisers are hoping for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for tumbling and hearing aid workers.
The friends and patrons of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini affirms.
Club wants approval of windmills examined
"Boisheim wrestles" sees no legal requirement for construction and has therefore contacted the county council.
The "Boisheim wrestling" association has asked Councillor Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that no wind turbines could have been approved at the time of the approval on December 30, 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette, as at the time there was only a wind turbine concentration zone in Viersen on the city border with Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the urban area.
Such zones are intended to prevent "saving" the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by changing the land use plan, it had not been approved by the district government of Düsseldorf because of a formal error.
"By the lack of planning permission, the approval decision issued is still illegal and therefore to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim wrestling."
Current state of affairs: The city council again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer break; approval from the district government is pending.
Erkens: "Therefore, at this point the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded."
The circle confirms the receipt of the call.
"The relevant letters have been received at County Viersen since last week," a spokesman explained.
The county is taking them to re-examine the matter.
But they are not expected to stop the proceedings.
With a view to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the county on Thursday did not wish to comment on the content of the association's argument "Boisheim wrestles."
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans to build four 200-meter high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.
Last year, the company in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved concluded lease contracts with the owner of the site, which is about 65 acres.
The construction of the four wind turbines is intended to meet the electricity needs of around 11 400 households - roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-seat households.
NEW Re wants to invest around EUR 20 million.
Last summer, Viersen's city council gave the go-ahead for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine plant in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg County.
`It belongs to us, it is our future', he added, after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
Thus, the emphasis on the civil character and form of association does not merely circumvent legal hurdles that may arise in the course of registration in court - it is also a political strategy.

City and retailers plan 'home shopping' weekend
Bad Langensalza and people from the region are expected to rediscover shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade association and the city council want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract residents to shopping in the city centre.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend should make customers aware of what offers their own city offers away from the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional suppliers is therefore planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies should present themselves with their apprenticeships.
In addition, downtown shops are expected to invite "midnight shopping."
The action not only targets residents of the city and the nearby region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, according to Christian König.
City administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
The trade association and the city thus go into another stage of the "attractive downtown" project.
This includes new offers such as the first "Active Day" to the Fountain Festival and an open-ended Sunday, talks with all traders and hosts to encourage them to actively participate.
Also attractive offers on Saturday and waiving parking fees on that day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potentials should be newly or re-opened.
This includes spa guests and tourists.
But many locals would have lost sight of the city centre when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to help revitalize the city center, right down to landlords, businesses throughout the city and clubs.
It was intended to overcome with a network the lethargy, which was partly spread, King said in the spring.
Birgit Strang, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen announced that the third "home shopping" day, for the first time five Thuringian cities, is taking part in Germany.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote for the appreciation of local trade and emphasize its importance to the common good of our cities," according to Stafford.
The action under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that each citizen with his or her purchasing behavior can influence his or her direct environment.

The report concludes: "In order to meet global demand, private-sector investment must increase by 20 to 30 to 200 to 300 billion dollars a year, assuming that government and philanthropy double."
The essence of the "This Time is Different" syndrome lies in the assumption that crises only afflict others.
The underlying assumption is that behind the longest chain there is a majority of users.
Our estimates are based on the assumption that profit growth meets consensus expectations.
Under the optimistic assumption that government spending and philanthropy double in the medium term, private-sector investment must increase by a factor of 20-30 in order to meet the required financial needs.
Assuming that the added value of suppliers falls in Switzerland, the purchases by the major banks generate value added of some 2.4 billion Swiss francs and 19 275 jobs.
That this relatively inexpensive cushion has a future is a real assumption:
And this assumption already takes into account the stricter capital requirements that apply to Swiss banks from 2018.
Assuming that CHF will depreciate slightly from current levels, we are lowering our forecast for GDP growth in Switzerland for 2015 from 1.6% to 0.8 percent.

If people had known too much about it over the past few centuries, relying on the images of heaven and hell "which up to now characterize our imaginations", the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes for accomplishment is characterized more by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.

Trump, after leaked transcripts of phone calls put Mexico under pressure over payment of border wall
Transcripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by The Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a proposed border wall.
The US President denounced him for publicly denouncing the Wall and reportedly said to him: 'You cannot tell the press.'
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to erect a wall on the US’s southern border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade deal for the U.S. allowed refugees who migrated to Australia to take over was "ridiculous," "me" and "stupid," and that the insistence on trade brokered by the Obama administration would make him look like a "depp" after he proposed a ban on resettling refugees to the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended the call after telling Mr. Turnbull that "this is the most unpleasant call for all day."
I was led to a pub where the conductor asked me to sit down to dine, but since I had no appetite, he left me alone in a large room with a fireplace at both ends; a chandelier hung down from the ceiling, and a small red gallery on top of the wall was attached, with various musical instruments.
And all of this you see with the appearance of an oil lamp hanging from the ceiling, and that of a bright fireplace, next to which I sit in coat and hat; my muff and umbrella lying on the tables, and I try to recover from the warmth of the oven from the stiffness and anesthesia, which caused a sixteen-hour journey in cold october morning at Millton.
After walking along the long gallery covered with carpets, I climbed down the shiny bare oak staircase; then I came into the hall; here I stood still for a minute; I looked at some copper tiles on the walls – even today I remember the same one depicting a dark-looking man in a pumpkin; the other was a lady with powdered hair and a bronze lamp, a large wall.
She climbed down from her chair and came to me to sit on my lap; then seriously folded her little hands, threw her locks back, stitched her eyes to the ceiling of the room and began singing a tune from any opera.
It was a large, stately walkway, with purple-colored furniture and curtains, a Turkish carpet, black-clad walls, a large colorful window and a rich carved ceiling.
I still see her in her raging passion when we had driven her to the extreme – she poured our tea, crumbled our butter bread, threw our books up to the ceiling and made a colorful mess with the ruler and the writing desk, the camaraderie and the fire pit.
Right, and faster than she expected: before she had half-drained the flask, she felt as her head hit the ceiling, and had to bend quickly to avoid breaking her neck.
By cracking the wood, the sun's rays burst onto the tiles with long thin needles, or they broke down on the edges of the furniture and swirled up to the ceiling.
»If you knew,« she continued and beat her beautiful eyes, from which tears rolled, to the ceiling, »what I dreamed of!«
The interior of the hut was just as decaying as the old one; its walls were tiled, the beams of the ceiling were shaved, the fireplace collapsed, spin news were hanging on all corners; in the middle was a series of shaky tables and broken slabs, in the ashes sat a dirty child, and in the background one looked up a staircase or rather a wooden door.
In this passionate declaration of love, the gypsy sent a glimpse of heavenly happiness to the dirty ceiling that stood here.
The young girl beamed, the eyes raised to the ceiling, sunk back and trembling all over the body, under his kiss.
On a sign Charmolue's put her back on the bed, and two raw fists attached to her tender body the straps that descended from the ceiling.
A crowd of a variety of people – no one cared about the incoming – filled a medium-size, two-story room that was narrowly surrounded on the ceiling by a gallery that was also fully occupied, where people could only stand brushed and hit the ceiling with head and back.
But not they circled, but the man, he had pulled his mouth wide and glanced to the ceiling.
Although there was no immediate access to light, it was not completely dark, because some departments had bare wooden lattices against the aisle rather than uniform board walls, but stretching up to the ceiling, through which there was some light and through which individual officials could also be seen, as they wrote at tables or even at the grid, and through the gaps people watched on the aisle.
He liked to hang on top of the ceiling in particular; it was very different from lying on the floor; one breathed freer; a slight swing went through the body; and in the almost happy scattering in which Gregor was up there, it could happen that, to his own surprise, he broke off and clapped on the floor.
»Under the ceiling and against the wall it will go.«

Moors Ford massacre: Activists stage racist lynch as appeal for justice resumes
A 1948-born Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled onto Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men stepped out with guns to block its way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit - took a long train at his cigar and glanced testily through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates were floating in fear.
"We want this n -- r Roger!" screamed the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
Shouting tore the silence as a young black man was dragged from the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, played on July 22, is just an afterthought.
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger," almost everyone in the audience encountered very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to replicate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It's really inconceivable that in all these years no single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the re-enactment.
"It's a dirty spot on a story, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifetime civil rights activist.
For him, the re-enactment serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want ending, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need to get justice," he said.
"We cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A forensic scientist lays a bed sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process.
But none has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say that the dual motivation for the lynch action has always been known throughout the city: Politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer pre-election race.
About the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farmhand Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they got away from prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the killings," concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local law enforcement not only involved in the killings, removed evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses."
Brooks put it more succinctly.
"It was an electoral law massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you register and if you vote, that will happen to you here."
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual retrial of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their representation is vivid, engaging, and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynch because then we are faced with its uglyness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
Samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest blacks - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched a well-rehearsed overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes co-director.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role never gets easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Marbaugh said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to go back to those times."
On the other side of the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcom screaming at Hester and pushing him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n -- he, vanish from my property!"
Rascona resisted the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!" asked Rascona.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too tough?
"No," Greene said, still chickening out.
"I just don't think white people said 'n -- - him' back then."
"But," quipped one of the other black performers.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R'."
And that's exactly where the energy shifts in the room, a sense of comradeship replacing the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it's sharp and forceful.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are cries, shots and then silence.
A woman, wearing a mourning dress, stands over the actor's corpse and performs Billie Holiday's grieving eulogy "Strange Fruit."
Her voice breaks at every second word.
Roughly a hundred yards behind, a group of about four dozen bystanders wields sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple have travelled from Ithaca, New York, to watch the performance, many just down the street.
They all experienced Georgia's humidity for nearly eight hours when Brooks led them on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to that point, the killings have remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand on the same land where the lynch killings took place, the air feels eerie.
When the last notes of the song sound out, Greene invites the crowd to get closer and inspect the corpse name.
Children hover at their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," grumbles a little boy, as if to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw the lynch rope away and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw hugged Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugged two of his fellow players and then collapsed in their arms crying, the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaking with him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know that's not in your heart.
You did it for a reason."
Later, the audience sits down with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta excited about re-enactment with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words about what feeling the performance left.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does with me makes me believe that the lynching continues," she added, "today this is just called police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, he eats and recalls civil rights.
He said he had already started planning the performance next year.
"The imitation is in a way inspiring, because it describes the horror of what we've endured, but it's also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's like if we don't learn anything from it then it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, those who do not know their own history, are condemned to repeat it."
"Godfathers" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf puts on a colorful-frivolous staging against a gigantic, six-story backdrop.
The Rotbühne (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows a shabby street corner with Wallrest and Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste und Elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes-Oldtimer parked in which the Rheintöchter poses as rocker girls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels remind of Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - which runs through his "ring" staging.
The three Rheintöchter - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduces them Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), smashing a corpse into the trunk in Hollywood manner and giving the octuplets clique.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen, which surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he beat Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) must also believe.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Stormily celebrated are Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who bows modestly and hands formal to the Mercury turf.
There is great applause for the Festival Orchestra, which is showing up for the first time on stage - given the great heat again in casual leisure clothing.
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his directing team was eagerly awaited.
Had he had to endure a fine pipe concert in 2013, five years later, there was great jubilation in which the sporadic "Buh" calls went down.
Festspielchef Katharina Wagner may have been pleased about this.
"You notice that the audience has grown up with the "ring" in some way," she had said shortly before performing the dpa.
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it also grew an understanding of his viewpoint.
I prefer a positive reshuffle.
Almost everyone -- except companies like ExxonMobil or U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney and their bought henchmen and misled followers -- understands that carbon dioxide gets into the atmosphere when people burn hydrocarbons, and that the CO2 there acts like a huge blanket that absorbs the infrared radiation coming from below and warms the Earth.
Sufficient brightness, good contrast, smoothness and mirroring of the screen surface as well as high resolution and proper dimensioning of the characters are important for the readability of the display.
The finer the resolution of the screen, i.e., the more "picture points" per character are available, the better the readability of the information.
Graphic screens usually have a higher resolution than screens intended only to display letters and numbers.
In practice, you can determine the effect of resolution and display quality by examining whether certain critical characters can be easily confused or not; pairs are easily confused characters:
In its motion for a resolution, our group demands the release of Souha Bechara and the other political prisoners and the dissolution of the Khiam camp.
Studies of the influence of topographic databases on the performance of external/internal propagation models in terms of data type, format (grid, vector) and resolution (in area and height);
Guidelines for quality control/quality assurance, such as camera quality, spatial and temporal resolution, etc., can be proposed if they prove helpful to this action.
Required configuration: PC with Pentium 100 Mhz (minimum) - 16 MB RAM (minimum) - CDROMLeser with four speed (minimum) - 15 MB free disk space - Superscreen VGA 256 Color (resolution 640 — 480) Windows 95.
Other databases with a higher resolution can be used within case studies.
Among the international projects at regional and continental level are the CORINE and CORINE-Phare projects at EUA, which, using TM images that achieve high resolution and accuracy, generate soil coverage information for Europe.
They do not contain remote sensing images with full resolution at this stage, although some low-quality samples are available.
The five basic properties that describe the soil cover (wood-like, grass-like, bald soil, artificial (buildings), water) can easily be determined using Earth observation data (both with low and high resolution) over large areas for mapping purposes.
This option has allowed the creation of a high-quality map base, with an expected geometric accuracy of 2.5 m (RMS) and a resolution of 1m.
In this case, with a geometric resolution of 1m each point can be clearly located, with the exception of objects whose resolution would be less than 1m.
The rule of thumb mentioned above must be revised when the geometric resolution of the image is low, i.e. when a significant proportion of the objects whose surface one would like to estimate is lost by the presence of mixed pixels.
On the other hand, there is still a lot of development and research to be done in the field of agrometeorological models and methods for monitoring vegetation using medium-resolution satellites.
GEOSTAT's geographic information system currently includes not only grids and point data with a resolution of 1 ha, but also various vector files.
Integration, management and maintenance of various geocoded, spatially relevant data available in the Swiss Federal Administration, which will cover the entire country and have a spatial resolution of 100 m, equivalent to a map scale of 1:25 000;
Data on the area-by-area development of a smaller number of land-use categories (possibly 20 or less) with a lower spatial resolution and accuracy could be published 1 or 2 times a year to close the data gap caused by the fact that the area statistics can only be produced every 12 years on the basis of aerial images.
The remote sensing provides the data according to geometric mesh of different sizes depending on the resolution of the sensor (pixels).
In addition to the characteristic program, the scale and geometric resolution (smallest different spatial unit), the nomenclature and the periodicity of the survey play a crucial role.
With regard to the selection of sample fields, however, it was evident in the first year of study in 1990 that very small fields can hardly be seen in the satellite image at the relatively low geometric resolution of the currently available image material (LANDSAT TM: 30 30 m).
For the calculations, six of the seven spectral channels of LANDSAT recordings of July 1990 and April and July 1991 were initially used; the thermal channel was excluded because of its low resolution (120 m2) it caused too many mixed pixels at the perimeter limits.
The intended improvement of the spectral resolution in LANDSAT 6 will, however, have a positive effect on the usability of smaller training fields.
Therefore, satellite images with higher resolution (SPOT, LANDSATTM 6 with 15 ‘15 m2) should be available as soon as possible; at the same time, it would be necessary to check whether sufficient precision measurements and satisfactory confidence intervals can be achieved by incorporating additional statistical and/or meteorological parameters into the correlation calculations.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry began in 1987 with support from the ITA consortium, using satellite data with high geometric and spectral resolution, to carry out estimates of cultivated land and crop yields, supplemented by sampling data from land use surveys on 4 500 land segments of 50 and 100 hectares.
An initial attempt to combine this survey with satellite data took place in 1981 with an image of Landsat MSS, but did not produce convincing results, which was attributed to the inadequate resolution of the sensor MSS.
It has also been shown that it is possible to use a satellite with sufficient resolution for the regression estimation of both ground data collected by points and segments, although SPOT seems more suitable for this field of application than Landsat TM.
A finer spatial resolution is needed to investigate environmental impacts.
Different applications in different geographical areas require different resolution and accuracy when estimating geophysical parameters.
For example, geostationary satellites can capture an area of one-fifth of the Earth's surface in thirty minutes and provide images with a resolution of 5 or 2.5 km.
It mentions some of the problems encountered in the project, including the difficulty of obtaining consistent multi-temporal data, the problem of developing a consistent and generally accepted classification, and the limitations of the scale and the resolution of other data with which land use data must be combined.
PC with Pentium 100 MHz (minimum) - 16 MB RAM (minimum) - CD-ROM drive with four speeds (minimum) - 15 MB free disk space - screen: Super VGA, 256 colors (resolution 640 supporting 480) - Windows 95.
The development of a method for producing high-resolution microradiographies of irradiated grains has improved the quality of post-radiation studies.
The resolution of REM is about 20 nm, the upper limit is at least 1000 micrometer.
Bandwidth is the main obstacle to conventional telephony: with conventional telephone lines, it is still difficult to transmit an image of good resolution with sufficiently high repeat frequency to really convey the impression of movement.
The image picker developed by IMEC delivers a better resolution in the center of the image (according to the fovea) than on its edge (Retina), using a very limited number (8013) at pixels.
With the EISS browser you can find images and view them at low resolution.
Equipped with the right signal converter, any TV device purchased today can receive digital programs, only not with the high resolution.
The stereoscopic projection table from BARON shows crystal clear images of high-resolution computer workstations and PC graphics cards.
The resulting demand led to the development of high-resolution CCD color imaging devices.
However, many users use the range of IVP products of slower devices with lower resolution.

As a mechatronic device, the SPA-Effek-tor/sensor offers some desirable characteristics such as high resolution, low time constant, easy compatibility with computer control and the ability to function within a wide temperature range and is suitable for the development of intelligent mechanisms.
The correlation spectrometers use the correlation technique to improve the resolution otherwise limited by the specially long reactor pulse.
The centerpiece of the project is "MGW," a "smart media streaming server," which allows content to be distributed on separate networks where audio/video bit rate, resolution and format are changed.
The European Commission's Joint Research Centre (GFS) Space Apphcations Institute has published a report which outlines a new methodology for mapping Europe's forests using an advanced radiometer with very high resolution (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer, AVHRR).
The measuring device is based on the application of a superspectral sensor with corresponding spatial resolution, potentially complemented by an infrared sensor with a lower resolution;
This will be the first time that such a "snapshot" of planet Earth has been compiled in terms of resolution and detection/covering.
The themes of the projects presented were: possibilities of supporting Altimetri for climate prediction, monitoring of marine pollution, use of earth observation to assess the health of European forests, the PELCOM project, whose objective is to create an "up-to-date" map of Europe with a resolution of 1 km, assessment of the impact of UV radiation and monitoring of ozone levels.
The data should be obtained from the output of meteorological models and low-resolution satellite data.
The third set involves managing a low-resolution processing chain for satellite data.
Operation of the MARS de data includes data derived from a global circulation model, satellite data with low resolution and derived products; mapping and providing the results; updating the corresponding MARS database.
Siemens dealt with data quality because fixed models require much higher resolution and accuracy than normal scans.
Finally, it commissioned the École Nationale Supérieure de Physique de Strasbourg (ENSPS) to develop a high-speed memory card capable of storing 2000 images with the full resolution of 512 vertical pixels.
The resolution of this vectorial equation according to the coordinate directions leads to accelerations that appear in x, y and z directions.
An excerpt from a measurement letter is recorded in image 43, where the signal frequency is recorded two times, once with high resolution.
One advantage of empirical versus the teoretic identification of categories is that it is possible to ascertain their general applicability and reliability in the resolution of ambiguities in real texts.
The resolution takes place in the original language; if at the same time it is translated into several languages, individual meanings can only be entered in these programs at certain points.
This could lead to an increase in the resolution of ultrasound testing.
For reasons of higher accuracy (greater resolution) in simulation on the hybrid computer and the uniform standardization of the entire road for any scheduling, the coefficients of the linearized rolling road model were calculated for target value deviations and multiplied with factors for amplitude measurement.
Full volume scanning with a high-resolution radar (like the one in Chilbolton) would take too long.
Of these data, those with low resolution (10 s) were only used to examine long durations (greater than 32 s) while those with high resolution were used to describe the process as a whole.
The shortcomings there, such as insufficient resolution and too long response times, are currently a major obstacle to the inclusion of certain information relevant to innovation in databases.
The IRSID's research project (47) uses a new generation of X-ray detectors with photodiode lines that allow the simultaneous capture of a large number of measurement points with equal accuracy, but with a finer resolution than with existing measurement devices.
However, using the new resolution has the advantage that you can now see the differences in surface temperature over the length of the absorbers flowing through.
The resolution of this model of price flexibility is achieved by balancing supply and demand.
The dissolution of the model leads us to set three marginal quotas.
Improving non-destructive methods with high spatial and temporal resolution that characterize, for example, bioactive interfaces (structure, function, stability) and the design of miniaturized formers for devices based on biological function.
The ability to link high and low resolution images recorded simultaneously from the same platform allows much more accurate analysis.
A high-resolution zoom effect and the same spectral bands make it possible to describe virtually every pixel better.
Radiometric resolution has been adapted to measure the differences caused by soil growth - and not just the great contrasts required by meteorologists.
Using the low-resolution images taken by NOAA (National Océanography and Atmospheric Administration) weather observation satellites (1 km), the JRC has developed a map of all the tropical forests of the Earth.
This inventory was only possible due to several technological developments in the field of microwave probes (microwave probes) with low spatial resolution.
Their aim is to follow the development of tropical forests almost simultaneously by combining images with both low and high resolution.
The high resolution images then allow the affected region to be analyzed in detail and to accurately determine the size of the existing forest areas.
A new type of sonar • In the field of marine technology and within the framework of the ACID (ACoustic Imaging Development) project, a new generation of sonars has been developed whose special feature is that they provide images whose resolution is independent of the distance between the detector and the target object.

By scanning documents, the contents of paper pages can be stored as a computer file containing an image of the original document with a certain resolution.
The resolution of a scanner is expressed in "dots per inch" (dpi).
Color scanners can now easily reach a resolution of 300 or 600 dpi.
The resolution of a fax scanner is much lower (100 to 200 dpi).
Due to low resolution and poor print quality optical character recognition for faxes is often difficult to use.
Henning T. pulls two cables from the stereo, knits them to a snout and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He appealed to governments in the region to commit to sustainable land use and sustainable assets that are not at the expense of Southeast Asia’s natural resources, mainly forests.
Some investors seem to be betting on safe assets such as gold.
For that, investors in Europe, on average, hold more than 34 percent short-term assets compared with 14 percent in the U.S.
For this, short-term assets in Europe are more than twice as strong.
Particularly for small countries such as Switzerland, where the opportunities for the spread of assets and the choice of securities are limited due to the size of the domestic capital market, the securities investment abroad is of great importance.
In recent years, the economy has benefited greatly from global demand for US assets, especially debt in the form of securities that financed a large current-account deficit.
The entire financial universe – investment and trade – has been increasingly covered for 100 years, as hardly in any other financial market:
Previously, sustained investment was primarily about filtering plants into "poorly regarded" industries such as alcohol, guns and tobacco.
Such investments, investments or cash reserves form the asset side.
What about currency risk – should assets be hedged?
In a broad comparison, we therefore expect the risk/return ratio of investments in the emerging markets to improve in the future.
Investment guru Jim Rogers once said that at an investment in emerging markets, it would be best to buy what emerging markets buy themselves, namely commodities.
A New Era of Sustainable Investments
Initial approaches included only plants in "sin" sectors such as alcohol, weapons or tobacco.
At Credit Suisse, we define sustainable assets as the express recognition that environmental, social and governance factors can influence companies' ability to generate long-term returns.
Our research methodology for sustainable investments begins with an analysis of sustainability opportunities and risks, which can fundamentally influence a company's ability to secure its profitability.
Why are sustainable plants and sustainable businesses receiving so much more public attention today than they did ten years ago?
Because of disasters like Fukushima or Deepwater Horizon, investors are wondering how their plants affect the environment and society.
The recent market turmoil has also made awareness of sustainable investments more important.
Do you expect the trend towards sustainable investments to be limited to pure niche areas such as environmental technology, or will consideration of ESG criteria become a permanent trend among investors worldwide?
We want to offer investors our know-how in the field of sustainable investments, play a visible and important role here, and at the same time participate in the steady growth in this area.
for investment and banking products, the consulting process, the instruments we offer and, most importantly, our employees," Pauli adds.
"Returns are important, no question," Pauli explains, "but good advice, including a clear rationale for or against a plant, is just as important."
"Investing has become a very complex matter," says Nicole Pauli, "and at some point product specialists need to have specific, detailed knowledge of a facility."
for example, asset management specialists in funds and alternative investments, or investment bankers for strategic decisions such as an IPO or a merger, and finally private banking consultants for the management of private assets.
For example, Value Investing goes to Benjamin Graham and David Dodd and their 1934 investment standard "Security Analysis" (German:
Speaking with John Maynard Keynes, Contrarian strategy supporters take the following view: "A fundamental principle of investing is to oppose prevailing opinion, because if everyone agrees on the merits of an investment, it is necessarily too expensive and therefore unattractive."
On the one hand, in view of the debt problems in Greece and Spain, the increased risk aversion would call for a flight to safe assets.
On the other hand, from the perspective of a foreign investor, an investment in Franken would represent a diversification in the portfolio.
In addition, inflows of funds into indexed products hit a relatively illiquid market, forcing investors of passively managed clients into assets to a level of return that we believe is unsustainable.
The true dimension emerged when the Bank’s third-quarter 2011 results were published: the new Basel III rules would have caused risk-weighted assets (Risk Weighed Assets or RWA) in investment banking to more than double, largely owing to fixed-income investments.
The lack of investment alternatives and the world's high liquidity in investors' deposits also speak for an investment in equities.
One makes a decision (buying an asset) and hopes for a positive effect (would like a return).
It is a measure of the volatility of returns on an investment around its mean value.
Instruments with very deep risk, such as most money market investments, receive a one, very risky assets such as options, but a five.
This is especially important given the current very unusual market environment for fixed-income investments, which is characterized by exceptionally low returns and a lack of supply of safe assets.
For investors who want to share in the potential of equity markets but are unwilling to bear all the associated risks, convertible bonds are an asset.
Many founders are also looking for ways to convert some of their assets into liquid assets and diversify into unsecured and uncorrelated assets.
Long-term investments in the oil, mining, manufacturing, and transportation sectors are more stable than the investments in stocks and bonds currently extracted from other emerging economies.
Responsible plants offer new opportunities
For example, the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance (GSIA)’s first comprehensive investment report from seven regions around the world found that at least USD 13.6 trillion of professionally managed assets now apply so-called ESG criteria (environmental, social and governance considerations, environmental, social, and governance criteria) to the selection and management of their assets.
This represents approximately 22 percent of the assets managed from these regions and proves that sustainable investments in the regions under investigation have reached a critical mass overall.
The final panel discussed the central topic of "Impact Investing", i.e. investments that, in addition to their financial returns, bring about social and/or environmental improvements thanks to sustainable business growth.
Referring to the collapse of the Rana factory in Bangladesh in April 2013, which caused more than 1100 deaths and around 1,000 serious injuries among the sewers working there, Oliver Niedermaier explained that long-term investors such as sovereign wealth funds, Ultra High Net Worth Individuals and employee benefits institutions consider these types of assets particularly attractive:
Responsible Investment (RI) or responsible investment is an investment approach that takes account of environmental, social and governance aspects ("Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations") in the selection and management of investments.
We have been able to raise funds quickly, especially for alternative investments, and now we need to industrialize all processes – from marketing to sales.
Speaking of growth in alternative assets, what is the result of this demand?
In my opinion, AM meets these requirements with its first-class products in the field of alternative and traditional plants as well as its strong multi-asset class solutions business.
How do you ensure a sound investment and risk management process?
What does this mean with regard to plants?
The new, hand-picked investment topics and ideas from Credit Suisse’s Investment Strategy & Research team have been developed to get the most out of your investment in the second half of 2014.
Giles Keating, head of research, explains the considerations behind the ideas and impact of the plant.
«For example, European customers like to delegate their assets and often choose asset management mandates.
The third factor could play a role, although we do not have explicit government guidelines on equipment.
Life insurance companies like pension funds, which have traditionally built heavily on fixed-rate assets, are facing problems.
Given their risk profile and also because of the investment guidelines (BVG), it will be difficult for these investors to increase their share of riskier assets such as equities or high-yield bonds.
This deleveraging means that market participants liquidate their emerging-market assets.
Stock exchanges are now owned by shareholders who expect an adequate return on investment.
The boom was triggered in 2001 by too little real-estate supply, significant job growth, expansionist monetary policy, and the tendency of households to shift their assets from equities to housing.
In addition to traditional direct investment, there is a whole range of alternatives that avoid the potential disadvantages of such an investment, such as low liquidity and a lack of transparency.
Simply put, I decide whether to invest more in bonds, equities, cash or alternative assets, as well as the allocation of various sub-asset categories, such as credit, hedge funds, or private equity, such as regions, countries, and styles, such as commodity stocks or growth values (Growth stock).
He now offers a range of ways to cover the megatrends of "demographic developments," "multipolar world" and "sustainability" with a single facility.
That would be the right environment for intensively dealing with plants that take these megatrends into account.
Indeed, investment in countries with weaker economic growth has yielded high returns in the past.
The primary investment theme for an investment in India is consumption, i.e. an investment in non-cyclical consumer goods, body care products, electronic products, high-demand goods such as cars and mobile phones or luxury goods.
For each profile, the bandwidth in which bonds, shares, alternative assets, and currencies are allowed to move is specified.
American data provide an approximate picture of the potential returns on farms.
Plants in farmland would have been a good mix for most depots over the last two decades.
Only the right harvest year makes a fine wine a good plant.
The report also provides valuable data for the important top-down analysis of assets and puts current market concerns about government debt in the right context: It proves that the estimated $42 trillion of global government debt in 2009 represents only one-fifth of the $195 trillion of global household wealth," explained Giles Keating.
At the same time, they open up interesting opportunities for companies to benefit from this development.
Danish entrepreneur and venture capitalist Morten Lund learned this for himself when a position of his portfolio of more than 80 assets – the most famous of which was Skype’s Internet telephony and video software – became worthless in 2009, killing him for all his assets.
The development of exclusive offerings has led to new structured products, customized investments and new investment funds, such as a $750-million loan fund.
We can support customers in all areas, from pure asset formation to the stage where they need complex solutions for investment and investment issues."
"Our biggest competition has been passive plants in recent years," explains Küffer.
He was involved in two companies and had made some of his investments through an IPO of both companies.
"It has already occurred that we have advised an internationally active listed company on mergers and capital markets while providing personal investment or financial advice to the family holding company," says Fleuriot.
In general, therefore, it is fair to say that hedge-fund assets, with the right advice and care, are not necessarily riskier than traditional assets.
Alternative assets thus remain an important component of any capital allocation.
Unlike in the 1990’s, the minimum interest rate can no longer be reached with an almost riskless asset like Swiss federal bonds.
The investment of coupons and repayment amounts of bonds at higher interest rates compensates for the long-term loss of market value.
However, in times of negative real interest rates, it cannot be regarded as an adequate investment for the medium and long term, as the investor has to accept a real loss of wealth.
By expanding the range of products and services in the areas of philanthropy, microfinance, sustainable investments and the so-called "impact investing", Swiss banks could thus acquire interesting new business areas.
Against the background of latent and difficult structural inflationary pressures, however, we are already relying increasingly on real assets.
Real assets form a cornerstone of our investment strategy.
The economic progress, the generous liquidity provision of central banks, the continued favorable or appropriate assessment of riskier assets, and the continued investment pressure should push the financial-market pendulum further toward opportunity.
In the case of alternative plants, the right mix of these heterogeneous plants is again needed.
Unlike the euro or the dollar, riskless Swiss franc assets still yield a positive return.
Should states be offered a single-course menu or an à la carte meal?
Personally, I believe that the invention of an à la carte meal compared to the menu, with only one dish corresponding to the barracks' eating habits, represented a major step forward for civilisation.
"We merely point out how fat meals can be replaced with low-calorie and yet tasty dishes."
In addition, some dishes are complete meals, while others consist exclusively of vegetables.
The protein/energy ratio (7 g per 100 kcal) recommended for meat-only dishes is above the value of a beef half (5 g per 100 kcal), but is significantly lower than that for chicken, poultry and fish (15 g per 100 kcal).
Fruit juices (with or without sugar added), nectar (dilutive fruit juice, usually added sugar), and dishes made exclusively of fruit have long been part of the diet of the infant to be desalinated throughout Europe.
The committee's recommendations allow a slight increase in the natural carbohydrate content (up to a total of 15g per 100ml in fruit and nectar and up to 20g per 100g in a dish consisting only of fruit) to allow it to match the taste.
Changes in dietary habits were also due to the explosive development of travel, mobility, the emergence of restaurants offering foreign dishes, and the growing popularity of foreign food.
Paella The dish is from the Spanish rice growing area on the Mediterranean coast, the region of Valencia.
A few days later, when he was remanded in the same court, he used his detector to detect ionizing radiation at the time something completely new and immensely impressive and found that the food was radioactive.
He gave a little of a radioactive substance to the food residue on his plate, and when the same dish was re-submitted to him, he used his radiation detector and found that the food was radioactive.
We also offer gluten-free alternatives and meals for allergy sufferers."
As a result, there is a great need for ready-to-eat meals, which has led to the development of new food products and packaging, such as TV dinners and pre-cooked dishes that are ready to eat or need only be heated in the microwave.
Examples of products in which these materials are already used are storage-stable dishes, snacks such as potato chips and peanuts, and also the ultralight 'brick-shaped' vacuum packaging for coffee.
Within a generation, our food has become more varied and varied - we eat food and dishes from all over Europe and the world.
In each school, the most successful dishes were awarded, and these recipes were published in the magazine "Ha Kuriren."
She learned how to prepare Italian dishes and especially desserts with fresh local ingredients.
If you like to travel in this way, you have to find these wonderful places, be sure to get a good reception there and try authentic regional dishes.
Guests enjoyed traditional Finnish dishes based on reindeer, salmon and caviar, accompanied by Finnish beers.
This event, which was held under the auspices of the President and the Secretary-General of the EESC and was organised in cooperation with Hervé Coupeau (Group III - Various Interests), representatives of the young farmers of France and the French overseas departments in committee, presented typical products and culinary specialities from Martinique, Guadeloupe, Réunion, Guayana and Corsica and presented traditional dishes and drinks.
If you add a little flexibility and freedom so that a group can exchange dishes with each other, you may be even more satisfied.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in multiple locations in their volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Lot: Normally in Steinfurt in the Furniture Exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the Furniture Bridge.
And I've also worked at the school all day.
What are your experiences with this?
Lot: It's a beautiful, broad spectrum I see here.
I have to deal with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
They are now 26 years, so a late-term volunteer.
How come that?
Crowd: I did high school.
And then a civil engineering degree, let's say, successfully aborted.
I realized for myself that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else, work with people.
And then I wondered what you are doing.
Make a social year, there's an insight, you can see how it really is on the ground, in the focal point perhaps.
And was it?
Crowd: I collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in social science in the winter semester.
I'm going to study dual, I'm probably doing a social worker training in the youth office in Herne and studying in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Is it not something unusual to have several different locations of use during the voluntary service?
Crowd: Yes, it's very variable.
It probably always comes down to where you do your FSJ.
You can do it from retirement homes to youth work - in all kinds of facets of social work.
It was very varied for me.
I was also partly in OGS, so in afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly what irritated me.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really happens.
Unlike in civil engineering studies?
Lot: Well, clearly, this is not about counting statics.
There are always other people who have a very different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, a young person who has been brought out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no touches?
Crowd: I'm not the guy for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but so is that life.
Simply, planning the invasion of Iraq, in which Rumsfeld advocated the use of fewer troops than proposed, implies an insufficient understanding of distributed systems.
Those who sought to limit the use of juries apparently feared in some cases a risk to state security.
Nearly three billion decreased the budget for various compensation for victims of Communism and crime, or for expenses for court disputes, even for construction savings.
Local authorities could not confirm the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials carried unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
The first two victims were seriously injured in hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The lawyer for Samantha Geimer, the victim, also again demanded the lifting of criminal proceedings.
Werner Söllner is not only a perpetrator, as far as you can tell, but also a victim.
The troops are overwhelmed with praise for their victims.
Mario Monti, Italy's future leader, has asked markets for a little more time to build his staff and implement a program that "victims" demand to recover the creditworthiness lost during the Berlusconi government's recent months.
If France were to decide to phase out nuclear power, the majority of these SMEs would be the victims, and the EUR 6 billion annual exports of capital goods and nuclear energy would be increasingly reduced.
For my group, it is particularly positive to see that the development initiated by the rejection of the budget by this House has now led to the beginning of the resolution of the problems.
Over and over again, however, there are forces that are dissolving in the picture, although EuroPilot, the organisation of European pilots, also says that Eurocontrol is the solution for European air traffic control.
The resolution of the Committee on Transport draws attention to the urgent case of Eurocontrol and calls for its dissolution to be avoided, or at least for its specific, albeit limited, functionality to remain.
How did the Commission assess the recent dissolution of political parties in Turkey by the military junta?
Europe is changing under our eyes, but, and this should be emphasised, with the result of the disintegration and destruction not only of the area but also of the family, culture and society: this is the Europe of the indifferent, not the Europe of the peoples.
I believe it is essential to prevent further proliferation as a result of the dissolution of the former Soviet Union.
The question that arises, however, is whether the division, the dissolution, will end the disputes or whether they will continue in the face of the new geopolitical links that are now emerging, which will hardly allow a peaceful life in the Balkans.
The dangers of proliferation of technology and technical know-how for the manufacture of (nuclear, chemical, biological) weapons of mass destruction increased significantly after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
Their desperation is the result of the dissolution of Yugoslavia and the failure of the leaders responsible to agree on how the peoples of former Yugoslavia should live together.
It is also mischievous when it says that, following the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, other institutions could be dissolved.
You are basically asking the Community the question: deepening the federal state or disintegration into a free trade area?
Unfortunately, however, the developments so far following the overthrow of the socialist camp and the dissolution of the USSR, the statements by the representatives of NATO and America, the blatant attacks or interventions against independent states demonstrate the importance of the character and objectives of any kind of conversion of the arms industry and conversion of military sites.
But this is no wonder: no country on earth, not even the richest and most developed Western country, could have withstood the sudden 85% decline in its trade, as occurred in Cuba by the dissolution of COMECON.
His dissolution of Parliament, dismissal of the judges and provisional repeal of the Constitution, his imprisonment of a large number of people and, of course, his ban on the free press - much of which is not only questionable when it comes to democracy, but directly illegal.
B3 - 002/94 - 0 - 278/93) by Mr Moran López and others to the Commission on the dissolution of the 'Gibraltar Social Insurance Fund'.
There is no doubt that the dissolution of a number of African states, including Somalia, Liberia and Burundi, which Hen Pons Grau mentions in his report, together with the social and economic destabilisation which led to civil wars at the end, played a decisive role in increasing the number of refugees.
Firstly, because we must not confuse the 'integration' of Member States into the Community or the Union with their 'dissolution' in the same.
Perhaps things could have been different from the beginning, from the hasty dissolution of Yugoslavia; many parties, including the European Community, are partly responsible for the fact that the current situation has arisen - secession, war, ethnic cleansing, national homogenisation, intolerance, territorial conquests, obvious incompatibility, acts of violence, cruelty, enmities that will continue for a long time to come.
After the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, these countries are seeking the path to democracy and a social market economy.
Huge political events following this signing, particularly the dissolution of the Kazakh Parliament by President Nazarbaiev, led our Parliament to suspend the process of ratifying this agreement until parliamentary elections were held.
There are disturbing reports of experiments carried out in Ukraine after the dissolution of the Soviet Union to humans.
It is not possible to strengthen Europe by dissolving it.
These include the immediate dismantling of military and civilian repressive apparatus, the prosecution of paramilitaries, an end to impunity and compensation for victims.
The Commission endorses the conclusions of the Vienna summit, which provide for the disarming and disbanding of these militias and the deployment of a United Nations mission to reduce tensions.
One thing I would like to emphasise in this debate is that today we are witnessing the disintegration and destruction of Kosovo and of an entire people.
The recent municipal and regional elections have been declared invalid and the military has taken legislative and executive power after the dissolution of the National Assembly.
The standard of living of their people has fallen steadily, the insecurity and influence of various mafias has increased alarmingly and the state is on the way to disintegration.
These include unpaid rectification, a replacement performance, a reduction in the purchase price or the dissolution of the contract in the event of defective goods.
- the EU recognized the new states that emerged from the dissolution of the Soviet Union (the Baltic states in September 1991), Yugoslavia (Slovenia and Croatia in January 1992, Bosnia-Herzegovina in April 1992 and Macedonia in 1995), and Czechoslovakia (the Czech Republic and Slovakia in January 1993);
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, it reorganised its relations with the parliaments of the new countries and formed four separate delegations: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, the three Transcaucasian republics and the Central Asian republics (including Mongolia).
According to the protocol annexed to the EC Treaty, the net value of the ECSC's assets has been allocated to research in the coal and steel sectors following the dissolution of the ECSC.
Finally, a cooperative operating in a country other than the State of residence can be transformed into a European Cooperative Society without prior dissolution.
The Statute is designed to allow public limited companies, which have their registered office and their main management in the Community, to set up an SE through conversion without prior dissolution.
The PCA with the South Caucasus countries is similar to the agreements with Eastern European and Central Asian states concluded in 1991 in connection with the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
The maintenance and consolidation of parliamentary democracy was therefore always the basic theme of the work of the EZPWD in the 1980s, which became more important after the break-up of the communist regime and the dissolution of the Soviet bloc in 1989 (meetings of correspondents in London, 1989).
With the demise of communist regimes and the dissolution of the Central and Eastern European hole since 1989, parliamentary democracy in Europe entered a new ara.

Resolution or liquidation shall not be charged.'
With regard to judicial cooperation in civil matters, the Council has given the relevant bodies the mandate to continue work on the draft Convention on the jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of decisions relating to the nullity of a marriage, divorce and legal separation (Brussels II), the scope of which should include the exercise of parental concern for joint children of the couple at the time of the termination of marriage.

In a communication from the Presidency, the EU condemns the repeal of the constitution and the dissolution of the parliament of that country.
A year after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the European Council is renewing its commitment to help in the transition from communism to democracy.
Resolution; termination of a company which precedes or follows the liquidation of the Company, i.e. the divestment of the Company's assets, satisfaction of the creditors and distribution of the remaining assets among the shareholders.
The object of this analysis is the laying of what is called the "seat" of a rope without resolution.
The addition 'without dissolution' makes it clear that these are the rules of international private law, which determine which law governs a company and whether a company should be regarded as a legitimately established legal person.
The study before us is limited to the question of whether the rules of the Member States in the field of company law and private international law should be brought into line in such a way that companies can move their actual registered office to another Member State without dissolution.
(1) the law governing a company; (2) the amendment of the law governing a company; (3) the possibility of moving the administrative headquarters of a company without dissolution from the founding state; (4) the possibility of moving the administrative headquarters to another Member State while retaining the legal personality of the company.
This requires the dissolution of the company in the state of departure and the re-establishment in the country of entry.
However, case law does not allow in all Member States that apply seat theory a company to have its administrative seat without dissolving into another
In some Member States this would lead to the disintegration of society in:
In all Member States, a company can move the administrative headquarters within the jurisdiction of the State concerned without dissolution.
(1) Companies should be able to move their administrative headquarters, i.e. their actual headquarters, to another Member State without dissolution.
(2) Companies are entitled, on the basis of the freedom of establishment, to relocate their actual seat without resolution (subject to the rules applicable in the Member States for reasons of traffic protection).
This represents a step backwards for those Member States that apply seating theory and allow seating to be moved without dissolution.
The withdrawal state can only delete these register entries on the basis of proof of the dissolution of the company in accordance with the laws of a Member State governing society.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area appear to be doing better, and they are therefore paying more state and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Still, the Washington area could lag behind if the federal government's spending cuts affect the job market in the region.
After reaching a peak of $30 ($23) in June 2011, Bitcoin fell to $2 five months later, before recovering to around $10 today (the courses are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).

Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it will cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 per cent as another restructuring programme is launched to overcome the pressure the company is facing.
The job cuts, announced mostly by Director-General John Fallon in late 2018 and early 2019, are in addition to his previous restructuring, which has already lost 4,000 jobs.
Pearson announced in May in a third cost-cutting programme a plan to cut costs by another £300 million ($394 million) to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which last month sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann, said that the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged after it reported an increase of 1 per cent to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others, officials say.

On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
In a NATO opinion, it said the explosion on Thursday night occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an "improvised explosive device carried by people."

The Taliban said they carried out that attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's most deadly militant attack since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as U.S. President Donald Trump weighs in on increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.

Although it will take time for the area previously belonging to the parish to be owned by the parish, there is no longer any obstacle to planning the project to be completed by a private investor.

One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, it would provide a living area - around 55 square metres - and an adjacent terrace with as much as 70 square metres of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the local council have the idea of not providing such a communal area as a meeting place only for the residents of senior-level housing, but to enter the community openly.
As an example, the word "Strickcafé" went round.

The building is located in the rehabilitation area.

It sees behind it a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even outside investors.

He then declares that the country is now under the control of its camp.
Our friends at Elephant Watch and Save The Elephants managed to reach higher-lying areas, but the camps were made to the ground.
Paula’s blog article says, “At this point, the water masses appear to be receding, but all the camps in Samburu and Shaba have been evacuated.”
Their camps are in the middle of the jungle, where they are less likely to be discovered and even though health facilities, schools and food are lacking, they are trying to survive.
Another participant described the problems she has when she wants to contact her husband in the camp.
She sent him money so he could buy a phone, but other people in the camp use it too, so she often has to wait hours to speak to him.

In one of the largest camps for internally displaced people in Kabul, a girl walks into a shelter to protect her from the rain.
The camp is only about 16 kilometers from the presidential palace, and yet this has not stopped Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from throwing barrel bombs over the people who moved back into their homes, with no food and fear of taking to the streets where armed extremists were present.
They point out that at a time when it was impossible to bring food and medical aid to the camp of Palestinian refugees, ISIS suddenly appeared in the middle of the camp.

Women in the camp say there has been ceaseless psychological terror since construction began.

Turkey's Constitutional Court on Friday announced the dissolution of the country's pro-Kurdish main party; a decision that followed immediately angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
The leaders of the DTP reaffirm that a dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the conditions of the PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan had led to clashes with police in recent weeks.
The property violations, judging by the signatories, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized teaching of students and teachers by a police command."

With personnel concerns, FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first compulsory game of the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the title defense in the Supercup against the postseason.
The personnel concerns at the German football league champions Bayern Munich are growing ahead of the Supercup on Saturday (20.30/ZDF and Eurosport) at Cup winners Borussia Dortmund.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti must also miss out on David Alaba in the duel with the BVB.
The Italian confirmed that on Friday.
In addition, the mouths of Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the past six Test matches, Ancelotti has blamed the physical condition and lack of balance in his team's game.
"We know we're not in the best physical condition," Ancelotti said, adding: "The main point is the balance in the team.
It was not good after all.'
However, the 58-year-old believes in a performance increase in the first official compulsory game of the season.

I have great confidence that my team is showing these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "difficult, intense game."

Walking in the resin of star to star
In resin the first "star trail" is to be created nationwide.
This is planned by the association observatory Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "Star Trail" meets the information needs of many resin visitors, it was said.
It combines nature, science, movement and sporting performance.
Members want to make tabs along the planned route and inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well-reachable installations at five to six locations" in the upper resin.
St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber would be eligible.
The information on the boards should be supplemented via the Internet.
A good mobile network reception therefore plays a role in the choice of location.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the Star Trail train is to be expanded by train.
"On the star trail, viewers learn a lot of worth knowing, for example, about the physics of individual stars," the association explained.
They also learned why stars have different colors, or why one star shines more than another, even though it is much further away.
It also tells you where a star is located and when it is best to see.
The association already operates the highest observatory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
The location in the middle of the National Park of Harz is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Conservation of Nature.

Since 2003, at the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen association, there has been something similar to the planned stargazer - the planetary path.
Starting in front of Gebhard's Hotel in Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path leads up to Hainberg and the Observatory - as well as an "out-of-the-world" location in Diemarden (community of equals) with the planet Sedna.
The poles with the individual planets - including the Pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the end point - are positioned precisely at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth shrank to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun, which is exactly 75 metres away, measures 70 centimeters.
The total distance of the planetary path is about four kilometers.
While the light from sun to pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to get to the Stele with Pluto.
Pedestrians are therefore faster than light in space.

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomakeko meet for first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lokonenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN's offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to welcome Lomachko, the World Boxing Organisation super-featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out the right hand and said, "How do you go, champion?
I wish you luck.'
Lomachko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga at 19 on ESPN on Saturday night.
As the pair posed for photos, Lokomotiv manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect magnitude."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I went up for Broner [at 140 pounds] but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to lightweight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what fans demand.
Let us give them that."
Lomachko agreed.
'Boxing needs this fight'.
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lokäko will have to contend with with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also has interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell following their lightweight title fight at the forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans have asked for him," Garcia said, and pressed openly later to fight at the network, which offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other names can generate that kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready, "
Garcia said he regarded Lokonenko as "an enormous fighter," and he may participate in his Saturday fight.
But Lokonenko kept in generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks the three-game champion from Riverside look "very slow, sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-off."
Garcia said the focus was to show potency, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum building for their own fight.
"This is the fight that needs to be carried out.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomakeko said: "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight."
Four injured after tire burst
Four people were partially seriously injured in an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at around 16.30 shortly before the junction of the market wide, presumably after a tire burst.
The car slammed to the right into the embankment, where it fell over and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were partly seriously injured in the accident.
During initial care for the injured by the ambulance service, the A7 was closed to the north for about an hour, then traffic on the left lane could be routed past the accident site.
This is good advice on land too, but it is all the more important under water because of the poor light conditions.
Fortunas Hoffmann: 'triple chain works better'
Andre Hoffmann hopes after 2:2 at the start of the season against Braunschweig that optimizing the defense formation will bring points in Aue.
With the first game of the season, Andre Hoffmann was happy with the result even if there had not been the two opponents at 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"These were two oppositions too much, and we need to be even better at Aue," says the defenseman from Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the Ore Mountains the tripartite chain should be further optimised.
And a goal after a free-kick the Fortunen don't want to catch either.
"For the future, no one will be on the line next to Michael (Rensing).
Hoffmann is convinced that even after the experience in preparing with the three-man squad, his team can cope better than with the four-man squad.
"Still, I don't know how we're going to operate in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we're just in the triple chain on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann have players who can build well," Hoffmann said.
"The premise is, but that we harmonise even better and that we do not do so many play-offs in the construction."
Of course Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"Whether you can talk about a failed start after a draw doesn't know.
The performance might well be okay," said Hoffmann.
"If, however, we can leave on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a proper start to the season."
His coach didn't want to know about it.
"I only judge the start of the season after six to eight days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue just because the Saxony game in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely because of a storm.
"Now they can virtually start the season with a home game," Funkel said and Hoffmann believes the players from Aue might even be a little fresher as they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a rising favorite in the bone.
"But they don't know as 100% where they currently stand," says the Fortuna's interior designer.
Although the guests from the Rhineland as a light favourite on Sunday go to the meeting at the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"That we sweep them away just because we are entitled to come under the first six is stupid," says Funkel, whose record in only one defeat against Aiken from nine games is thoroughly positive.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga you have to beat from the start," Fortunas head coach explains.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And so Funkel certainly doesn't want to experience his players on Sunday.

On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to being involved in a rampage in Norway in July in which 77 people were killed, held his first public hearing in court.

On the day the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the politically divided question of whether to hear a challenge to President Obama's health-care laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by the firm that will represent the case in court.
The lawyer who will stand trial and claim that the law is overturning is believed to be Paul Clement, once general counsel under the George W. Bush administration.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court discussed the case at a Washington hotel.
"This startling break with morality and the contrary to the code punishes the lawsuits of some judges lying, the court adhering to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the U.S.
"The judges won and dine during a fundraising event with lawyers with suspended proceedings in court."
Kagan was general counsel under the Obama administration when initial legislative appeals came to court in the first instance.
In a news conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the extradition.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square, we will meet in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray testified that the "outrages" response to the eviction of their camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the violent eviction of the square and allowing the protesters to tent.

New findings of Swedish Asylum Age assessment tests published
Recent results from tests for asylum-seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Council Medicine) began conducting the tests last year.
They are expected to make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum process after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migrationsverket) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, Migrationverket has sent out 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) were judged to be 18 or older, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years old."
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results in recent months are steady.
"We don't see a big difference in statistics over the past few months, the numbers are pretty constant," he told The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases that "propose that the person investigated was 18 years or older."
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet looked at the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of those cases, the person had openly said she would turn 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRT recordings of knee joints are made, then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
One skeptic is endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing people's biological maturity to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it safely, we shouldn't pretend we could," he told newspaper Metro.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is that if the person is just under 18, in this case that is around 10%."

Full in plan
Work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete section was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We're very good at the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Road and Transport at the Government Bureau of Freiburg.
In April, work began simultaneously on all three necessary bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The building is scheduled for October and it is easy to be sure that the timetable will be adhered to.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a concrete vaulted bridge with a red stained sandstone and a total length of 4.80 metres.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now entered the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over Lauterbach.
They are made of red stained sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are 12, respectively 10.60 metres long.
The bridge at the local entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 m wide and seven tonne so-called bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning.
This is an edge fixing which is also used as an operating path.
A 2.20-metre bridge cap is to be deployed on the southern part of the bridge on Friday.
Then the pedestrian path should run.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
The installation of pipes through the building in Lauterbach required particular sensitivity.
Because there is also a fibre-optic cable that many companies are connected to.
Residents were informed of the project by handout in advance of the work.
In addition, fish and crabs first had to be fished.
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the Collector in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is punctually regulated by a traffic light.
For construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbacher entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is completely closed.
The total cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000.
It is financed by the country.
Recognizing the increasingly complex task facing the United Nations in its efforts to prevent and resolve conflicts and to secure and consolidate peace, I asked a group of experts led by Algeria's former foreign minister, Lakhdar Brahimi, to submit a report providing an overview of peacekeeping operations and making proposals on how they could be strengthened in the future.

AfD in Gerolstein: Bum protest at German potato salad
It is not so often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), what is otherwise difficult to reconcile comes together.
The parties represented in the Vulkaneifel district (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left) belong to a broad alliance, which is peacefully flagging this day because the AfD in the Gerolstein City Hall invites Rondell to "great campaign start" according to the poster.
And familiar names to launch - such as Alice Weidel, who along with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the general election on September 24, and Deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix of Storch.
But those who are on the ground hours before the event begins don't want to listen to the AfD learners, they want to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful."
Originally the town picnic was planned under the motto "All at a Table" on the fountain square, but it now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
A colourful picture to see.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of Forums One World and one of the authoritative organizers, really likes: "Toll how many people have come here."
There's music and plenty of food, including an "urgent potato salad that even the AfD could easily eat," says the woman who brought him along.
Police have ordered many officers to Gerolstein, showing presence mainly at the station, which is just a few metres from the venues.
How did the AfD actually get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Volcanic Eifel reports he has sought such an event and got the supplement.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first enquired in Daun but got a cancellation there because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes there was not enough parking.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a beautiful event here."
Looking at the event at the Rondellvorplatz, he says, "This is people's good right, principally, it remains peaceful."
That's what it does: At about 20 p.m. on the Rondellvorplatz a band provides entertainment, in the city hall various speakers, including the rhubarb-painted AfD chairman Uwe Young.
There are about 200 listeners in the room waiting for the top candidate for the general election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy federal chairman Beatrix von Storch to make their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officers have had a quiet evening.
The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour, the guests in the front seat have a longer breath, but it is also scheduled to clean up shortly after 21 a.m.
The police can move away - no special incidents.

Posaune hits trumpet
A rehearsal with the Wolfacher Posaunist Frederic Belli will be available in the series of Haslacher Monastery Concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 20 p.m. in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or even "Balkanfolklore" meets a classical German education with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov is solo trumpeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is solo composer of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of different genres.
For example, Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new guise, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by the jazz award-winner Nils Wogram, mixing classical, jazz and free play into a fascinating work of art.
This centerpiece of the program was premiered only this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and even more: The Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert.

Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything out," Kristen Stewart said bluntly about her bisexuality.
"When I once put in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh this was cool, what comes next?'"
The Hollywood star's most famous relationship was with her "Twilight" colleague, Robert Pattinson, who ended up bitterly apart.
Despite all this, the brittle actress assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think about it, I'd played it?"
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I've always lived dualism and seriously believed it.
So it has never confused or hindered me.
I just never wanted to be taken seriously."
She suffered particularly from it, according to "Bang Showbiz" but at school, when she preferred to dress like a lad: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me.
When I was eleven the children told me I would look like a lad.
I felt really assaulted, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think, 'Girls, be proud of you!'
Particularly to the public, she doesn't like to explain her love life: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
Some may call me thankless, but I do not like having to justify myself to the general public."
West Virginia governor announces he is switching party
. The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have distanced themselves from me," Governor Justice said.
"Today I will tell you many prayers and many reflections ... today I will tell you, as a resident of West Virginia, that I can no longer help you when I am a Democratic governor."
The rally erupted in jubilation.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and inherited a coal business from his father.
It is worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, on Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee issued a statement saying, "Governor Justice's change of party is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us rather than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governorships and control of the fewest legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.

Coe praises 'honest' Russian apology for doping scandal
The world's head of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday what he described as an apparent apology from Russia over a doping scandal, but he reiterated it was not the moment for the country to get back into the sport.
Russia's athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country's banishment from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all athletes who were snatched away gold and silver medals at competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open response today, a very honest presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.
"The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation recognised itself that it had experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is reshaped."
Coe said he was also "pleased" about Russia accepting the criteria for its reinstatement.
"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the task force's recommendations that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia," Coe said.
"We have to do everything in the coming months to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the tainted system," he added
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players in the World Athletics Championships, which begin in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said Monday that Russia still needed to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug tests are still inadequate and banned trainers are still operating freely, he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.

Funeral for soldiers killed in Mali
At a funeral service in northeastern Fritzlar, about 1,000 people of the two killed in a helicopter crash in Mali were thought to have died.
The ceremony took place in Cathedral City on Thursday amid high security precautions.
On the unsolved crash cause, Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
But she described the two killed pilots as "kings of their profession."
"We bow to this highest sacrifice they made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old chief of staff from northern Iraq were killed in West African Mali on Wednesday a week ago.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and brought to the Fritzlar Cathedral of St Peter on Thursday accompanied by a German army death guard.
At midday, only the relatives in the church said goodbye.
Afterwards, the funeral ceremony began in the circle of the family, close friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politicians.
Among them were Hessen's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the general inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Mourners laid down roses, loved ones stood arm in arm at the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlars and numerous soldiers pursued the ceremony on a canvas.
Defense Minister von der Leyen called the killed soldiers "highly decorated" and deployed.
The chief of staff helped set up the flight operation of the Tiger helicopter in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots in his regiment.
Volker Bauerachs, commander of the regiment, which includes the soldiers, also declared: "If this crew could not avert the crash, then no one would have been able to."
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister of the Leyen: the deployment was dangerous.
But he is also of high importance "for a country from which we are only separated by two states," she said.
After the funeral ceremony, coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they will be buried, the Bundeswehr did not specify.
According to Credit Suisse's Fair Value model, the Swiss franc to the euro remains undervalued, although since 2007 it has upgraded from a franc rate of over 1.60 to around 1.50.
Developed countries' equity markets are rated at a price-earnings ratio (KGV) of 17 versus a KGV of ten for emerging stock markets.
Value investors focus on the "course" in price-earnings ratio, while growth investors are more interested in the "gain" element of this metric.
Thus, Contrarian investors choose firms that are undervalued and have negative price momentum.
Finally, the Euro-Franken course remains an issue:
For example, the higher and more often the share price oscillates, the greater the fluctuation width and the riskier the capital investment is.
«The Swiss National Bank’s decision to set the rate at 1.20 was decisive in enabling growth to revive quickly,” Melli recalls.
If you look at the price of gold over a longer period of time, you have to say that the yellow metal is not exactly cheap at its current rate.
Companies' profits and earnings momentum are recovering from deep levels, and valuations such as the price-earnings ratio are also starting to increase in anticipation of rising profits.
In 2010, Geithner still attracted the attention of the media and Chinese authorities when he complained at the WEF about the yuan's price.
If a rapid appreciation of China’s currency is potentially dangerous for the global economy, why is the White House so fixated on the yuan’s price?
"Even though the price/earnings ratio is currently in the range of values recorded in 2007, we do not currently expect a significant correction.
Macroeconomics and corporate profits will not be the main driving factors, which is why we expect the price/earnings ratio to expand in 2013.
Shirakawa forecasts inflation of just 0.6 per cent in 2014, which is well below the BoJ's target of 2 per cent and could result in the central bank having to weaken the yen rate even further to meet its inflation target.
The highest returns appear to be achieved when dividend yields are high and the price/earnings ratio (KGV) is low.
higher return on equity, higher price book value ratio and higher pay-out ratio," says Stefano Natella, Head of Global Equity Research in Credit Suisse Investment Banking Division.
There are higher price/book value ratios.
The PEG ratios (price-to-earnings ratio divided by profit growth) of most large and almost all medium-sized enterprises are still fairly cheap compared to other emerging economies.
As the franc strengthened, the dollar’s value fell from around 4.30 Swiss francs to just over 2 Swiss francs in a few years.
Moreover, valuations of future price-earnings ratios appear attractive, as most companies’ shares are at the bottom of their historical range.
Finally, the costs for local companies are rising less than those for their competitors abroad, while the exchange rate with the euro remains constant at a rate of around 1.20 francs.
The basic idea behind convertible bonds is that they will be converted into shares if the company's price falls below a certain value.
When the franc rate was 1.60, that set off much larger margins than now, when the rate is 1.22.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all assets from its portfolio where money is used for betting on food prices," Bode said.
As a result, just eleven per cent believe that it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer facilities to bet on food prices.
Many bank customers would also face personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such deals: One in two, according to the survey, would terminate all investments where money goes into commodity speculation.
Finally, and this probably says most, our survey of business leaders showed that a clear majority of Britain wants a course towards changing the agreement and a trade-based relationship with the EU, not politics.

Jiménez believed that micro-credit was a 'serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty', and that the governments of the industrialised countries should now work 'more than ever' according to criteria of solidarity, and should not allow solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
However, he reluctantly admitted that the strange severity under which he suffers could be attributed to a more natural, in a sense more tangible cause – namely, the serious and protracted illness – indeed, the apparently near resolution – of a tenderly loved sister – the only companion of long years – of the last and only relatives on earth.
Prince Henrik wants no grave next to his wife
The man of Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
That divided the Royal House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple are attached to the Cathedral Church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard has already produced a sarcophagus for the two.
The queen agreed with her husband's decision, the notice said.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried is still unclear.
But he did not intend to be attached to his French home.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title.
After ousting his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
He retired in 2016, also taking the title "prince grind."
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he does not see himself as equal to his wife - nor after death, explained Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman of the Danish Royal House.
Where the 83-year-old's final resting place will ultimately be is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be attached to his French home, but to Denmark.
He likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years.
Born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French nobleman, Margrethe met in London in 1965.
At the Thames, he worked in the French embassy.
While his later wife always received expressions of popular sympathy, Prince Henrik had a difficult standing with the Danes in his almost 50-year reign.
In an autobiography, Henrik said over the first few years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival everything I did was criticised.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine rather than beer, silk stockings rather than knitting socks, Citroën rather than Volvo, tennis rather than football.
I could not hope for leniency even for the Gauloises I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco, and who had a reputation here for being the brand of socially critical intellectual.
I was different.
I seemed content with that position and not ashamed.
These were two mistakes!'

Prime Minister Weil wants speedy reelection
CDU and FDP ahead of possible majority in Lower Saxony
Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a swift reelection of the country's parliament after losing the red-green government majority, but he does not want to resign.
Because spoke in favour of dissolving Parliament on Friday.
Previously, the surprise departure of a Green MP from her rural parliament in Lower Saxony plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the official election date, the Red-Green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and the FDP.
The previous Greens MP Elke Twesten justified her move with the non-nominee for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she declared in Hanover on Friday.
CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to advise his group to include them.
Together, the CDU and the FDP would have 69 seats in Lower Saxony’s Landtag, the SPD, and the Greens.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new Landtag will be elected regularly on 14 January next year.
Thumbler said that the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to govern without a majority in this situation.
Stephan Weil, however, considers it essential that the Landtag decides on its own dissolution as soon as possible.
The CDU group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility that the country's day will strip the prime minister of confidence and choose a successor.
"Our constitution offers several options.
These opportunities need to be examined legally cleanly," Mr. Thümler said.
"One will calmly discuss all issues when they are legally soundly examined."
Thumbler called Twesten's move "yet something curious."
The politician himself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good."
She described herself as a supporter of black and green.
The Greens called on the renegade MPs to return their county mandate.
"We assume, of course, that she returns with immediate effect her Landtagsmandat, which she has received through the Green Land List," state chairs Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner told AFP.
Greens leader Anja Piel said: "We deeply regret Elke Twesten's decision."
She deliberately chose not to have a debate in the group.
"Also, given that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step."
SPD candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of Dutch Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behavior of former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the voters, but also betrayal of Red Green," the Federal Chief of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supports the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to quickly re-elect the Landtag.
Leaving Twestens costs Red Green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician puts "in her injured vanity and in her frustration her personal interests ahead of the good of the country," SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil criticized.
"It's a scandal that the CDU is involved in Lower Saxony this dirty intrigue game and is trying to make political capital out of it."
Dutch CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his MPs include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The SPD's leader in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of using personal career thinking to distort the outcome of the 2013 general election.
The CDU was strongest before the SPD at the time, but SPD and Greens had a razor-thin majority of one vote in the country's parliament.

Agriculture Minister in interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisonous eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) speaks and responds in the interview with the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print.
On the consumer protection portal www.food Warning.de the federal states provide the latest information on the affected egg strains.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we currently know, a health hazard is virtually impossible.
Does Aldi now undertake the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the supply - because the central role of the enlightener is not really perceived by the Federal Minister for Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the Länder.
Nevertheless, my house moved up immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries ever since Germany became aware of its concerns.
All information and risk assessment is available to consumers.
Trade, like manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are transportable and safe.
If eggs exceed the maximum residue limit of 0.005mg/kg, they cannot be transported.
However, untainted eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time, businesses are not to blame.
Are production plants and consumers in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, the production companies are not directly responsible.
Instead, they face economic damage because of alleged illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there are too few inspectors in the worst case scenario.
Is it just a lack of staff or of coherent competence?
It was the official controls that revealed the operation.
The truth, however, is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100%.
It is precisely for this reason that it is vital to ensure that such events are properly investigated and handed over to the public prosecutors in cases where crimes may be committed.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the authorities responsible to provide full information.
Is regular alarmism really necessary in the case of food scandals?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and transportable food.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
By armoured means, manufacturers, dealers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of Fipronil insecticide in the rearing of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to investigate the matter promptly and fully.
How football's financial rules affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules, which aim to prevent unfettered spending by European football clubs, will not disrupt Neymar's world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, because the senior organisation overseeing the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean PSG will eventually have to prove that Neymar's transfer was funded without big losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will be tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly loosen the money to allow Neymar to underwrite and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from Qatar's energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on acquiring players, but must counter with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them to break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after being elected UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had incurred huge debts in their pursuit of success were effectively cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on club debt to monitoring its losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher business.
During the current three-year FFP disposition period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of £30 million.
And, though Platini fell from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, remains committed to deterring excessive spending.
"Surely, FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future," Andrea Traverso, who is in charge of FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar's buyout clause in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount to the accounts over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so the transfer fee for the next five years of €44.4 million can be declared in the annual accounts.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.
The PSG was fined EUR 60 million (then $82 million), which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014/15 Champions League be limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking at clubs that could try to overhaul their financial supervision by inflating their revenues through companies linked to the owners of a club.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship were to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income.
That is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of the PSA's sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that part of PSG's payments to Neymar could come from the organising committee of World Cup 2022 in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar in 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and that such a maneuver could easily be found for UEFA regulators.
Previous sanctions against PSG mean UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG over Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said on Thursday.
They spoke on condition of anonymity with The Associated Press as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million in 2015/16 with sales of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the last fiscal year have yet to be released.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club anticipates that sales will rise by at least 30 per cent after signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go and they tried to prevent Neymar's move by claiming that PSG would breach the FFP.
"It is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's eventual ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state funding a club.
"It's the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once a country owns a club, anything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country."
The Turkish community of Germany reacted calmly: at the weekend it recalled the victims of racist violence with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
The urban tender for the 16 gates reopens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
No doubt a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either that is the case, or someone intends to set gates on land.
Collserola is more complex," said the architect, for whom the title "Tore of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": it must not be conceived "as accesses to a park, but as limiting areas where action must be taken."
Otherwise, the programme and the definition of a project for a gate would conflict with that of the architect of the gate next door.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, called for "success", "marginalised" people, "which are always in front of closed doors" to be awarded "hope" and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opens its gates, infected by the spirit of solidarity."
Nord Stream, New Gate to Russian Gas in Europe
Swiss is looking for a new choggi supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has produced in-flight chocolate for the Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is at a possible end: the airline is rewriting the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed, at the request of the news agency sda, a corresponding report from the newspaper "Northwest Switzerland" of Friday.
According to current plans, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and undergo quality control.
"With current supplier Chocolat Frey, we are very pleased," the spokeswoman said.
About 17 million small red-white packaged choggie plaques at 14 grams distributed per year to flight attendants before landing to passengers.
The Swiss did not want to provide information on the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwest Switzerland" at 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves annual sales of around one billion Swiss francs.
But more important is the advertising effect: For a chocolate manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
The Swiss do not want to reveal the number of applicants for the new tender.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey intends to seek a renewal of the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer could not be reached for an opinion.
Chocolate boards have been distributed by Swiss since 2006 on board their flights.
Before Swiss signed a contract with Migros's daughter, Barry Callebaut, in collaboration with Hug, had delivered the chocolate tablets.
The ability to place the logo led Swiss two and a half years ago to launch cooperation with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers are spoiled with treats from Confiserie Sprüngli, Business Class nascent passengers Schoggi from Lindt and Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey.
Also on the short circuit, Swiss Schoggi is distributed by Chocolat Frey, both in business and economy class.
Energy policy cannot, however, be assessed solely from an environmental point of view, since not a single power station - of any kind - would soon be set up, and all chemical industries, such as stone, clay and earth, would have to be analysed for the conditions of acceptance of their waste by the public, and - to quote Mrs Weber once again - they would have to wait extremely long, if not in vain, for acceptance.
In addition to clay and glass, metals, cardboard and plastics are now used as raw materials for their production.
This should be done in the best tone.
And the best tone is under the House of Commons.
I have not heard any conservatives say that we should store the waste in the best tone under the Thames.
The area is urban (10% of the area is cultivated); the light to heavy soil (sand, clay, clay) is mostly suitable for soil management (41% is farmland), the forest hardly meets (8.2%).

According to PRINZ /15/ bind soil types always consist of a mixture of clay and slurry fractions with very different proportions of grain fractions.
In the same climatic conditions, the content of organic substances in clay is higher than in the cuff or clay.
In particular clay, but also clay, are installed as natural materials in locations with predominantly static compaction at the landfill base.
The sealing of landfills with such clay-sand mixtures is extremely economical and easy to control.
The secondary soil (tone) sealing layer of variant 2 consists exclusively of earth materials.
It is recommended to produce this base layer from condensed soils (usually tone) rather than from existing insitu condensed soils.
A number of procedures are offered by the EPO to calculate the power of the earth (tone) layer.
The new draft directive points out that the current legal requirements for this system variant (60 cm thickened tone with a k_value of 1 ¬ 109 m/s) are no longer sufficient.
In the narrow-wall process, the condensation of the underground is achieved according to the respective geological conditions either by filling or compressing seal masses (tone cement and bentonite cement mixtures).
The gradient i of the wall area is calculated from the water level difference and the thickness of the sealing wall, while the gradient i for the sealing horizon (tone, slurry) is determined from the water level difference and the binding depth of the drum.
The sound acts as a semi-permeable membrane.
Anion exchange capacity, however, is increased by the organic substance Kerogen, which can be finely distributed in clay up to 2 watts.

Foini potters still form their vases after lateral anthropomorphic forms of clay.
The European coastal tree is very long and consists mainly of sand, clay or chalk, therefore soft, easily erodable materials.
The research was applied to the simulation of the following problems of practical interest: • BACCHUS 2 test, performed in SCK/CEN in Belgium: exploration of condensed, expansive tone for use as a technical barrier in relation to
These early signs on clay or stone were the first precursors of sophisticated linguistic tools, the development of which has not yet been completed.
The tone is initially fitted with a glaze layer and then sintered in the fire at temperatures up to 1160°C to achieve the desired mechanical strength and hardness.
The German company Eisenhütte Westfalia-Lünen has been building small forwarding machines of muzzle, fox and badger type since 1965, mainly used in soft rock (tone, plaster, pyrite).
100 g of earth (fertile, non-sterile earth) is suspended in 1 000 ml of chlorine-free drinking water (floor species with very high levels of clay, sand and organic carbon are unsuitable).
The results of the studies carried out under the PAGIS project were published in a five-volume edition: a summary (EUR 11775EN), sound (EUR 11776EN), granite (EUR 11777FR), salt (EUR 11778EN) and the submarine sediments (EUR 11779EN).
The tone, this formable material that our ancestors used for a variety of purposes, and which is used today in areas as diverse as construction or the pharmaceutical industry, has attracted the attention of scientists and technicians with the task of developing a safe and reliable system for the disposal of nuclear waste through deep layers of rock.
The first chemical component of the tone is an aluminium silicone, which is fireproof material so that the tone is not a good heat conductor.
Figure 3: Clay and clay slate formations in the countries of the Community that would be suitable for the final disposal of highly radioactive waste (1980) and some sites of current in-situ explorations of clay rocks.
The target formation, the so-called boom-tone, is found underground and has a power of more than 100 m. It reaches so deep that a camp could be set up at a depth of more than 200 m below the surface.
The boom sound has some very attractive properties, such as lithological homogeneity, very low permeability and excellent retention.
Under the boom sound you see a succession of shifting layers of sand and sound.
At Mol and in its immediate vicinity, the sand layer under the boom ton is not used for pumping groundwater because of the high content of dissolved substances and low yield.

Inactive materials such as clay, possibly mixed with polymers, powdered ash or asphalt concrete, but also geotextile films such as synthetic polyvinylchloride (PVC) or high density polyethylene (HDPE) are increasingly used as material.
When the landfill is closed, the end cover is made of clay and arable crumbs about 1 m high.
The last 50 cm of the pit is sealed with an impenetrable material made of concrete, bentonite or clay to prevent the flow of air and the escape of the collected landfill gas into the atmosphere.
Components of the secondary rock: limestone clay, grey and black clay, limestone, compact grey mergel.
Since the addition of sulphuric acid and the mixing with clay did not produce conclusive results, the possibility of mixing unquenched lime and, if necessary, a puzzolanic reaction agent was examined.

Nostalgia goes into niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of the story is simultaneously nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s-era horror era (when the presenters David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By getting to the heart of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who will grow up - they nonetheless managed to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later," with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody goes more according to the casting principle, including a riff on the stalker films of the 90s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand That scooped the cradle").
At one point, a character stumbles through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The amiable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
And there's another crazy-bad plot in which Ronald Reagan (including Mr. Showalter) is included, now backed by George H. W. Bush (a well-received impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It's especially fun to see the ever-young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's sublippenbart of "Singles," whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old knack.
It's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I regard as its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the gang as they attend the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now recalls another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War by "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its east-to-west ring-fight iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas as director, claims to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main characters - a hard-nosed Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of 'Find the voice out'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the veracity of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is included - that it often plays like a single one.
With six long episodes dragging on, and the comedy isn't fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective," which has been edited to a lesser length, could better deliver its Agitprop satire as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always staffed by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything for a laughing stock.

Blow to drug mafia in country
The police have succeeded in striking the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the prosecutor's office told Konstanz on Friday.
15 defendants between the ages of 25 and 77 were arrested and have already issued arrest warrants against them.
Officials also secured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms, and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people have been arrested in simultaneous raids in Italy.
German arrest warrants were issued against the two suspects Italian.
The two are therefore presumably extradited to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In all, more than 300 police were deployed.
Mafia members are accused of organised drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder and robbery and blackmail.
Since summer 2016, the public prosecutor's office has been investigating the organised drug trade in southern Germany.
There was a lively exchange between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the large operation was also accompanied by four officers from Palermo on Wednesday morning.
The investigation focused primarily on Italian nationals closely related to the Italian mafia.
An incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, in which several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, is also likely to go to the gang's account.
Way laments big gaps in the Foreign Office register
'Data from citizens who should not appear': according to one report, the register of foreigners in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious errors in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government's Refugee Management Officer, Frank-Jürgen Weise, drew attention to large gaps in the Central Register of Refugees.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to "some serious misjudgments" in asylum procedures and deportations, Weise warned in an analysis presented to the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
According to figures, the register covers ten million people with foreign nationality, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is thus managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data has not been adequately maintained, data quality has not been good in parts so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 was found "from people who haven't been alive for a long time, or from citizens who have become German citizens and shouldn't actually appear in the register."
"Faulty data input can significantly slow return processes," the report said afterward.
In addition, the statistics on people who travel are EU citizens who do not have to leave.
However, such misallocations led "to a distorted debate about how to deal with expatriates," the analysis said.
Meanwhile, the federal government appears to have begun sending refugee families with under 16-year-old children back to Italy when they arrived from there.
This is based on an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the New Osnabrücker newspaper.
The paper therefore states that the BAMF is carrying out such procedures "in relation to families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - back to Italy since 1 June 2017."
This has been virtually impossible since late 2014, according to the newspaper, citing the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Agreement, refugees from the EU state are the first to reach them.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that state can return him to the country of entry.
To justify the move, the office now writes: "In between, the absorption capacity for families with underage children has increased significantly in Italy."
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments sufficient.
Other EU states would also send refugees back there under the Dublin agreement.
The left-wing group's domestic policy spokeswoman in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticised this decision: "Families with children face human rights abuses because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system and a threat to child welfare."
Second best result achieved

At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded Friday.

Traditionally, the municipality pays homage to the council's multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It's ingenious how our body is designed for this and we pay respect to donors who provide their blood to strangers, even to disinterested ones," said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained the district readiness manager of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the canned ones are broken into their components.
Three people could benefit from a donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions being carried out in Oberreichbach in the spring.
"This year we achieved the second-best result with 114 donors," said the DRC's circular readiness manager.
Obviously, the move to Theaterhaus a few years ago led to higher attendances.

The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and slowing inflation dampened speculation of a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it kept interest rates on family incomes in the midst of intensifying pressure.
Bank Monetary Committee (MPC) policymakers voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members seeking a rise this month as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly Inflation Report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6%, warning that the pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to close to 3% in the autumn.
But it signaled that interest-rate hikes would become necessary in the coming years to rein in the inflation fueled by Brexit, and it said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year after Brexit.
It will call for time for the funding plan to provide cheaper funding to banks from next February, although it has been said that it now expects to raise £15 billion more under that system - with £115 billion.
Minutes after deciding on the interest rate, the Bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term as pressure on real household incomes continues to weigh on consumption."
On interest rates, she reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be required to cool inflation and a "somewhat larger" scale than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that increases would be "gradual" and "limited."
The Bank’s downwardly revised growth forecasts for this year and next are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after these news.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31, and fell 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision to make no change comes after the latest disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations of a rate hike and raised GDP to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the bank closes at the end of the year.
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households hit by rising inflation and small salary increases as the tightening first gets worse before it gets better.
She added that monetary policy cannot "prevent the income slump" over the next few years, but she added that wages will "clearly" recover at the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy is also being strengthened by rising demand for UK goods, due to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after cutting interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to sink.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to achieve full price and economic performance.
Before the Bank’s latest policy judgment on interest rates, the call for a rate hike had risen as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers demanding a rise to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell last month from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the Bank said that was expected and that it would pick up again in the coming months.
The bank said the excess relative to its target of 2% was "entirely" attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In light of the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as lenders are clamoring for deals and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those where existing deals are phased out and the new mortgages are completed, and many with fee-free options and low rates are becoming more popular."
NHS (The National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to "transformational" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight in the High Court against funding for the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken before intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 per cent, is now delivered by the health service via an initial three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal last year upheld a High Court ruling that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite claims that local authorities should fund it.
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens as an "important new intervention," while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a "crucial moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register and more clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious diseases.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that there are just enough drugs in a person’s body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken every day or so two hours before intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who were not successfully treated.
In clinics, suitable participants are identified who agree with the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People living in England and registered with a family doctor can also apply for possible participation at their local participating sex clinic.
The programme will raise £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is targeted, recorded and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: "This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than three decades of progress in addressing one of humanity's greatest health challenges."
Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if targeted at needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that will be genuinely individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority now must be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that PrEP testing medicine has been obtained, we are well on the way to protecting more than 10,000 people infected with HIV."
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health secretary, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and slow implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This trial brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study be carried out as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will help us move a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society."
Living the big life: Midstairs and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court flat into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, narrowed down in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.
It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this flat in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with them and made an offer that day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a nestled layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, a lot of light.
That was my requirement," she says.
To that end, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5-foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two spaces above each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the preset.
"The steelwork is pretty complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without us having to bail.
It was not just a matter of building a simple platform, but of creating steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."
That arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full over each other - with much extra drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.
At both ends is a short corridor mirrored to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance mirrored units provide space for all of Joanne's tops and glasses.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen if it's not used.
Collapsed kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A little bit of engineering went in," Erfan explains of the steel-enhanced, furnished MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so when you push the door, it's slipping very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to win an extra 16 m2, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you will sell the floor space - or as your property is valued," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will come in and make a calculation based on ground size."
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space while using high-quality materials that give the space its luxury advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and that therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," Erfan says.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical outlets in the walls.
These are important, but they do not play with your heart."
It shows that an apartment can turn through good design and increased square meters of something by default into something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave these.
An architectural history with ups, downs and happy endings: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels in 1958 won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and passed away.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the patron, who had received all the applause and who had received all the prizes in advance (Gastronomy contest Easter, audience voting on the best hand-made costume and Reina Madre), "had made other female candidates jealous, which the queen was stressful, which therefore could not shine on stage."
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the programme "Como en casa" at channel RCN, said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the contest will not be Queen after all."

Brothers fight for a $500 million property empire
Two brothers are in a dispute for one of Victoria's biggest real estate empires worth more than $500 million four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.
Former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be shared.
Paul has wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but a sharp clash over separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Along with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the Westco family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
That money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis' portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centres in the suburbs.
Under an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third.
A court filing says this means Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought were the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the Supreme Court's first hearing was held.
The brothers are also now fighting for control of existing business - something Colin, as Paul claims, has ruled him out.
Colin argues this is not true but accuses Paul of managing some possessions incompetently.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage prescribes that family is the main priority," he wrote.
Costs are rising in the case, with hundreds of sites with affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both parties.
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property amicably to their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when leaving the company.
Both Lukas and Mark are bitter, Paul says "about the terms of their financial separation."
Colin has been very restrained despite being a former AFL board member and following a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the TV star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied by SMS to say "I really can't say much" because the case is in the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and move our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he was trying to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he "still hoped for a solution."
On Friday, that hope seemed over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
We strongly condemn the disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force.

The Council should also have the conditions to provide technical assistance to states and to provide policy advice to states as well as United Nations bodies.

The OHCHR can benefit from the support, analysis and expertise of civil society and, in turn, can provide support, training and advice for contact with UN bodies.
At the international level, some civil-society organizations can help establish or mobilize global partnerships on specific issues, or draw attention to the plight of indigenous peoples and other fringe groups, while passing on other best practices to other countries, sharing community experiences and providing technical assistance and advice to governments.
In my opinion, such a body should not exercise early warning or monitoring functions, but it would be useful if Member States could at any time consult the Council of the Commission for Peace-building and request assistance from a permanent peace-building fund in order to strengthen their national institutions to reduce conflicts, notably by strengthening the institutions of the rule of law.

RIGHTSGRUNDLAGE: Article 103 of the EEC Treaty, basic Regulation 974/71 ZIELE: avoid short-term distortions of trade flows, which would result in the difference between the market price and the agricultural conversion rate or 'green' rate, which is pushed out in ECU, in some Member States.
- in the case of Member States whose currency is higher than the ECU value calculated on the basis of the agricultural conversion rate applied under the common agricultural policy (green rate), compensatory amounts are levied on imports and granted on exports (positive VAT);
To this end, the WAB will no longer be calculated according to the difference between the green course and the guide course, but according to the difference between the green course and the "guide course multiplied by a correction factor."
For 100 000 people, each of whom receives DM 4,500, of which 50% is from the ESF, funds of DM 225 million or ECU 120 m1 per annum would have to be earmarked.
On 8.10.1990, sterling joined the exchange rate mechanism; its ECU benchmark rate is 0.96904, slightly different from the previous fictitious rate.
It is precisely this outflow that has helped push the value of the yen below the rate that might otherwise have been expected.
Whether temporary foreign-exchange funds, backed rates for certain amounts or much else, economic experts must help here, but quickly and without long and time-consuming checks.
The second value is the current conversion rate, or 'green rate', which allows common agricultural prices to be converted into national prices.
Since the price of the new euro may be unstable, particularly in the initial phase, it may also lead to large fluctuations in world market prices for agricultural products if they are converted into the euro.
Does the Commission consider that the principle of equal treatment under company law, including in accordance with Article 42 of the second AG Directive of the EC, should be respected if the Danish State is able to enforce the confiscation of shares of Teledanmark's private shareholders at a rate of 125 and sell these shares of Teledanmark at a rate of 4,700 to Ameritech USA?
We know that the value of the euro is falling, the price is too high.
- The main courses: from the ECU value of a currency, their course can be derived in each of the other participating currencies (cross rate): these are the main bilateral courses.
The Community is reimbursing the amount referred to in paragraph 1 for the ECU (1 ECU - 6,44527 ffrs, applicable on I. May 1996).
The financing plans of the Community support frameworks and the Community intervention amounts are expressed in ECU, and the course laid down in this decision will apply.
The financing plans of the Community support frameworks and the amounts of Community aid are expressed in ECU at the rate set out in this decision.
(1) The agricultural conversion rate applicable to the compensatory amounts is the rate applicable on the first day of the month when the products are actually taken over by
(2) In the case of Guayanas, the agricultural conversion rate applicable to the compensatory amounts is the rate applicable on the first day of the month on which the products are shipped.
If the amounts payable in the individual currencies are fixed in relation to another currency, the conversion will take place at the exchange rate quoted on the order.
For the other currencies, there was no gap between the green rate and the market rate (including correction factor).
The conversion takes place after the course, which is valid 30 days before the last deadline for the offer fee.
The financing plans for the Community support frameworks are expressed in ECU, and the course laid down in this decision applies.
(3) The Commission's financial contribution will be paid in ECU at the rate applied on the first working day of the month in which the reimbursement request published in the Official Journal of the European Communities was submitted.
Tax law, on the other hand, introduced procedures relating to the deductibility of exchange rate differentials arising from the conversion of monetary foreign currency items if the cut-off rate differs from the rate at which they were booked or was included in previous accounts (Article 72 of income (tax) of law 917/1986).
Yields and expenses are converted to the price that was valid on the day of business incident; in practice, an average price is usually based.
If the business is settled at a contractually agreed rate, this course must be used.
This means in particular that monetary foreign currency items will be converted at the cut-off rate unless a hedge rate under paragraph 48 is used.
Consequently, the results of the financial year are always reported at the rate applicable on the balance sheet date.
In most cases, the claims and/or liabilities expressed in foreign currency were recalculated at the rate that prevailed on the day of their booking, with unrealized gains not taken into account at the balance sheet date, but the corresponding conversion losses were well reported.
This course must be indicated in the annex."
Intangible assets and fixed assets are indicated with their initial purchase value, calculated in ECU at the rate applicable at the time of purchase.
The property and buildings acquired by the Commission in Brussels after 1992, as well as those of the representations and delegations, are listed in the wealth overview in the amount of their local currency acquisition costs, which were converted into ECU at the time of purchase.
The buildings in Brussels acquired before 1981 were included after conversion to the ecu course of January 1981.
Intangible assets and fixed assets are indicated with their initial purchase value, calculated in ECU at the rate applicable at the purchase date.
When the annual estimates for the expenditure referred to in Article 4 are drawn up, the Ecu/ Dollar rate is based on the average market parity during the first three months of the previous year.
During those years, there were considerable currency adjustments: the exchange rates of all the currencies of the former group of countries rose, the French franc declined slightly, and all other exchange rates fell sharply.

Trump’s new chief of staff plans to limit the president’s media abstinence.
Others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the White House's new chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in hopes of keeping the chief on a more even course.
Here's a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the White House’s new chief of staff, met with senior executives on his first day in office, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump’s White House that he wanted to fix: poor information that gets into the president’s hands.
Kelly told staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information."
Kelly’s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television stretches back decades - and now that he is in the White House, his television ads are still strong.
"When candidate Trump was upset because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage of posts that were to be persuaded," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we others don't know - that Trump's tweets would have contained even more spark without their interventions.
We'll probably never find out about the tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his staff have managed to keep trouble away from him several times, their efforts have paid off.
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from generating controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House made up of competing parties keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world.
Politico - preoccupied with this story - reported in May on advisers' penchant for providing dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press releases, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he's bent on finding out where these come from.
That's exactly what happened in late February, when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the Web site of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused deputy chief Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a pile of leaks" at the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he has not offered specific evidence or that he has made false allegations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-Staff Reince Priebus and the White House secretary general, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives."
How did that work out?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still seeking influence.
These invariable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
In short, they fear that all the sacrifices made for price stability will have been in vain.

Economists like to make prices the basis of their thinking.
Traditionally, Europe’s social democracies have brought scarce goods and services like concerts and operas to people’s attention not so much by willing to pay, but rather by promoting the queue at the ticket counter, because prices are kept low by huge subsidies.
Firstly, because some young people are not taking advantage of these cheap cards anyway, because they would not listen to classical music at any price.
Yes, to some extent, this is the price of progress.
In the current boom, contagion took place within markets and across markets, as rising prices fueled enthusiasm - and thus further price increases - first within a city, and then in other cities, even at the other end of the world.
Historically, home prices have gained enormous momentum, and prices in these cities are still rising at a rapid rate, even though the increase is a little slower than a year or more ago.
Based on high projections of growth trends, it seems certain that prices will rise substantially in most of these cities for another year or more, even if the rate of increase continues to fall.
Prices in glamour cities are likely to fall sharply in the next serious recession, or in the event of a shock to the local economy and too rapidly rising interest rates.
In that case, contagion within and across markets could trigger a downward spiral and drive down prices for years.
Travelers negotiate a ditch and return to 'millionaire' row
Some of the West Midlands' most affluent landowners are back at war with some determined travellers who negotiated a ditch drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travelers parked their 20 caravans in a field outside an affluent Strait of Solihull, dubbed the "Millionaire series."
They brought horses, babies and an army of vans after they were only thrown out in May, but without being deterred by a ditch excavated by the council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in defense equipment and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unobstructed to find a way.
Angry residents have afflicted the Solihull Council, which said it was "useless to deal with the problem."
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday night after being sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at the passers-by.
The Council must be shamefully forced into action because it was useless in dealing with the problem.
Travelers were there in May, moved on and are now back.
More came last night, probably more today."
She added: "The Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with this by holding long briefings to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my local tax if the Council cannot even stop it."
One resident, who asked not to be named, said: "It's ridiculous we've just seen the last round of these travellers, only to be looted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park area."
A spokeswoman for the Council of Solihull said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp on land beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihull's police and we are taking the necessary legal steps to ensure they move forward as soon as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation where the court will have to examine when we present our case."

From Birkenhof, Waldhotel Luise
From the former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is due to reopen on 1 March next year.
That's good news for the city.
After all, with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the former Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, around 30 000 nights per year were lost at the time, as well as revenue from the tourist tax.
In the fall of 2014, in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the county, the hotel building was offered to the county council as collection accommodation, causing controversy.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by establishing a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel site.
The decision was not uncontroversial at the time in the local council.
But above all, Freudenstadt's Lord Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious prospective buyers at the house at the time.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels group with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to turn it back into a three-star plus category house called Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Joytown property.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof building rubble containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house it becomes clear how extensive renovation work is being done.
The floors have been torn out, blankets have been partially dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building.
There is still much to be done by March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," Thomas Scherer says in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should be "beautifully close to the people", as Thomas Scherer puts it.
"We want to do a piece of jewellery."
The hotel features a swimming pool, spa and meeting room.
You don't want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an upscale downtown level, Scherer points out.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its 60 or so rooms, wants to be broad, Scherer explains further.
The hotel is suitable for individual holidaymakers, groups or businessmen.
Talking to OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause he's already had, according to Scherer.
The city's ideas are similar to those of the hotel group.
"We are on the same line."
Asked about the level of investment, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to set out exactly.
Just under a million euros, he reckons.
The exteriors are also brought to the fore, which is already clear.
In an interior courtyard, a large terrace will be open from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way around it.
The "much more important task" is ahead on Sunday.
Not a single accident is the same and calculating the cost of parts and working hours can be a long and complicated task.
The base models usually only support 2GB cards.
The joke of the matter is that the company appears opposite the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
They must also accept that the SIM card does not run on their name in their phone, so they cannot have it in full the same way as the normal customers of mobile operators."
"In these places, the traveller also has a desk with trained staff, which advises interested parties on internet purchase and also plays the coupon on the card", said Martin Opatrný, spokesman for the project.
A passenger who does not travel by suburban buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupon will end can, in turn, go to the self-service vending machines where the coupons are played on the card.
The new elections are over, and now it is all about the coalition; in the debates on public television, party leaders hardly looked in their cards.
Russia case: U.S. special investigator sets grand jury trial
In the Russia case involving U.S. President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is alleged to have set up a so-called grand jury after a report.
The panel has begun work in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal wrote, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper viewed the move as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified his investigation.
CNN reported there were already preliminary charges by the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence has long accused the Kremlin of deliberately meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there was any collusion between Trump’s campaign and Moscow.
The focus of the investigation is to include several men who acted as an adviser to the Republican in the campaign.
According to reports, Mueller was increasingly scrutinizing Trump’s private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator had personally targeted Trump, investigating the allegation that the president may have obstructed the judiciary in the course of the affair.
Grand Jurys' main task is to examine present evidence in possible criminal cases and decide whether to file charges.
Grand juries are therefore also called indictment chambers.
Mostly, they are switched on when there are larger and more controversial cases.
The procedure is always done behind closed doors.
The panel can also be turned on by the prosecutor to pre-load people for interrogation under oath.
According to CNN, preliminary charges have already been issued revolving around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump’s adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and then-electoral chief, Paul Manafort, were in the conversation.
Legal experts said Thursday night on U.S. television that the ad shows that Mueller is not intimidated in his work and that he wants to act quickly if necessary.
But it does not necessarily mean that the grand jury will be switched on at the end to decide whether to bring charges.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the panel is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new source of concern for President Trump.
Amid the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to portray the Russia affair as a campaign by his political opponents.
"The Russia story is a total fabrication," Trump said.
The issue gives Democrats a way to "feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about."
His special adviser, Ty Cobb, said in an opinion that he knew nothing about setting up a grand jury.
But they also usually work in secret, he stressed.
The White House supports any measures that speed up the work of the special investigator in a "fair" way.
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that he is not investigating the president.
There is no reason to believe that this has changed, the statement continued.
Mueller, however, was only deployed after Trump fired Comey.
Because of that outburst, charges against Trump were made that he wanted to obstruct the judiciary.
Comey testified in June before a Senate committee that Trump asked him to stop investigating then-national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under intense pressure because of the investigation.
According to US media, the White House collected material against the special investigator and his associates.
That sparked speculation about whether Trump would sack Mueller.
Unlike an independent special investigator of Congress, such as the Watergate affair involving the late President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Justice Department at the president’s insistence.
However, several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators on Thursday presented legislative proposals under which the special investigator could no longer be dismissed as easily.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg drifts in Antarctica
In West Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg has dissolved from the shelf ice of almost seven times the size of Berlin.
That was announced by the Bremen-based Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The colossus, weighing more than one trillion tons and 5800 square kilometers, is now heading north, and will probably take two or three years to melt.
It is one of the largest ice giants, with 175 kilometres in length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, researchers have registered over the past three decades.
He is not a danger to people.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in breaking the iceberg is unclear, according to research.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual outbreaks of ice cream in the region for about 30 years, the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now abandoned colossus has so far been part of the Larsen-C shellfish.
Shelf ice swims at sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It grows further and further into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C shellfish is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this shelf, the balance of waxes and aborting was upset a few years ago.
A complete shelf ice fell there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a strong case to be made that the Larsen C shellfish is also in danger, because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is now.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and could fall apart if a piece breaks off at a key point.
Melting shelf ice and icebergs does not raise sea levels as they swim on water and displace ice as much water as it does after melting itself.
However, the loss of the shelf leads glaciers to flow directly into the sea and out much faster than before.
This may raise sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the British Research Project on Antarctic Monitoring (Midas).
According to AWI data, the Larsen C shellfish is the fourth largest shelf ice in Antarctica with nearly 50,000 square kilometres.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 metres thick, at the front edge of the free ocean about 200 metres.
It regularly breaks down there.
"While it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary of Swansea University in Britain.
"This is the furthest withdrawal since records began," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it is controversial whether the Larsen C shellfish will now grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But it will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many of the Antarctic Peninsula’s ice buckets have collapsed in recent decades.
This long tin of Antarctica stretches toward South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by around three degrees over the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where temperature rises fastest.
The adjustment fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member council, presumably at the UN's Global Environment Facility (GEF), as can be read in the "Piac és Profit."

CDU wants house price on staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU is demanding to leave the employers' association in order to become more attractive.
Just before the summer recess, the County Council has won 41 new posts in administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 trainees have completed their first working day.
The training places at the circle are obviously very much in demand.
Approximately 620 applications have been received for this year's courses.
However, the circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
At present, there are still 50 unfilled positions at Mettmann County.
They include doctors, engineers and general administration forces.
Together with the FDP and the UWG, the CDU now wants to take the initiative to address the shortage of skilled workers in administration.
According to the wish of the parties, the administration is to develop "a concept for recruitment and personnel development".
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract the shortage of applicants in the future, it says.
The overall concept should be internally and externally oriented, show concrete measures for cross-country beginners and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle is dealing with staffing problems that were previously unknown.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms.
The talk is of a veritable "competition of public employers."
In addition, a high number of staff who are sick or old are leaving the service.
It is therefore high time for action so that more jobs are not left unfilled.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the joint motion with his party.
He caused a nasty surprise recently in the district court, when he publicly questioned the staff costs cap and stunned the other parties.
Peoples want all options reviewed to allow a leave of absence from the municipal employers' association.
"If we don't come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration should seek a house tariff with the unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county's cities," according to people.
In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than the public service collective bargaining system actually provides for.
Salaries are currently strictly prescribed, increases or more money are available only if you move to a higher level, geared towards professional years.
But the county's responsibilities have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new prostitutes law.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Councilman Thomas Hendele and County Director Martin Richter have a problem: They have too few staff.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting associations that vote more for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections.

Italy tightens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue doing so unless they comply with new rules governing their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis' warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a boat from the German aid organisation 'Youth Savet' because its team had effectively worked with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, declined to comment on detailed allegations made by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone," the organization said in an opinion piece on social media.
"We can only judge all the allegations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can judge the situation."
Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat from 'Youth Rescue', the Iuventa, since October.
It is believed that his crew is taking hoseboat migrants on board, which are delivered to them directly by traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of flouting the authority of the Italian coastguard to monitor rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives.
Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa must in particular have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said Thursday that the new rules would be seen as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve "essential changes or disabilities" to their bailouts.
Among those who refuse to sign up is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti meanwhile said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue efforts had plummeted in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperate with local mayors have borne fruit.
"In the last few days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hopes of reaching Europe.
a modest home market compared to worldwide sales.
The central and eastern European countries have become more important to Switzerland since their accession to the EU, both as production sites and as sales and procurement markets.
When the price of oil reached $150 a barrel, US sales were already shifting in favor of more austere models.
At BMW, the growth rate in sales for the first six months of the year was 100 percent.
We also have this experience in investing in the sales of road cars.
And he adds that providing information about a company's philanthropic activities is just as important as communicating sales or competitor information at board meetings.
Sales at TrueView Ads, i.e. advertising clips that are either played before the start of a video or displayed as display advertising next to it, also rose 45 percent last year.
The skilled industrial engineer (Berchten) and the robotics specialist (Guernier) are convinced that their product will be marketed, and expect between 80 000 and 100 000 air bags sold each year for the future.
For the time being, sales of computers, printers, servers, and additional storage capacity will lag behind software and services, but will catch up over time and perhaps even boost earnings in the hard-fought PC market.
After a fall of 10% on the previous year in the first quarter of 2013, PC sales to companies reached roughly the same level in the second quarter of the year, suggesting a stabilization of sales figures.
Rises and Trials
Nine Weilermer Biker, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the northern Palatinate to enjoy four days of trials and sights.
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.
Accommodation in the Wachenheim Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michael Chapel above Deidesheim.
The viewpoints were followed, partly on towers, from which one could see far beyond the peat forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there were always longer climbs for which long trials rewarded.
The second day went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, vantage point at vantage point, combined with "flowy" trials and moderate climbs.
On the last two days many vertical meters were called again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refuges brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim the bikers breathed in the open-air inhalation saltwater.
Neustadt was also steered.
After 173 kilometers and nearly 4500 meters of altitude, the group had met the peacock forest from its best side - sporting and cultural.
Console rather than grass - Bundesliga gears up for e-sports
Are sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future rather than struggling in the wind and weather over stadium turf?
Fact is: E-sport has long become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high scores included.
This has also been recognised by the first Bundesliga clubs to become increasingly involved in this area.
The beginning of 2015 was VfL Wolfsburg, later followed by FC Schalke 04 and, most recently, VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and contracted two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the VfB," says Executive Director Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure "that a number of clubs are still rising on this train."
Next weekend FIFA is organising the first Interactive Club World Cup in London.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football in particular has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds that young people are still going to the stadium in the future," the 52-year-old says.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract, you could be present online much more often than just sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year.
What exactly is it about?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or football simulation FIFA are contested at the level of competition.
As in normal sports, leagues have long established themselves in which the professionals compete.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, e-sport is already part of the official program.
But is it a proper sport at all?
For many, the notion is surely getting used to.
Ingo Froevil, too, has long been grappling with the question.
For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-Sport is a sport because it is competent and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sport - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding, and a rapid response capability.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console but also their bodies and pay attention to nutrition.
"The fit player is a good player."
Frozen, though, also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more of an issue."
Controls were difficult to implement in online games, and the scene lacked the structures of classical sport.
On the positive side, the scientist highlights the high inclusive effect of e-sports.
The players are travelling internationally, which is like a big global family, as there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, EUR 50 million was implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to be 130 million.
That is little against the nearly $2.4 billion of the Football League.
However, eSport is "no longer far removed from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte advisers write.
Internationally, many countries are already ahead.
Big markets are Asia and the US, where ex-basketball player Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez join the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher is investing in eSport betting provider Unikrn.
Something is happening in Europe too.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports have been introduced as a teaching subject, Froefel says.
In the Netherlands and France, according to Dutt, the Football First League clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
"In European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB CEO Röttgermann.
Falling into nostalgia only, and closing the old days, is no longer enough.
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but also to align the company with the modern market.
"We live in a digitized world," says Dutt.
"You cannot hold on to the fact that only football remains as it always was."
Unfortunately, the European system of public art finance is falling victim to slow economic growth and growing budget deficits.
Immediate deployment of an adequate civilian and security presence during the months immediately after NATO’s 1999 bombing campaign might have created appropriate safeguards against the backlash that turned victims into perpetrators.
The aim of one of these projects is to provide medical information to developing countries via the Internet, another is to provide communication equipment and experts for use in disaster and humanitarian emergencies, and a third is to provide considerably more children worldwide with vaccination protection.
Access to resources is, however, only part of the problem, and I would like to emphasise once again the importance of denouncing the manufacture, distribution and use of these indiscriminate weapons.
The Forum, which successfully completed its fourth meeting in February 2000, deals specifically with forest issues from the point of view of sustainable forest management, addressing not only the underlying causes of deforestation, but also trade in forest products and the use of market-based instruments for forest conservation.
Through its Networking for Sustainable Development programme and through partnerships with the private sector, the United Nations Development Programme promoted the use of free software and provided information on sustainable development in numerous languages.
Seven organizations currently use the system, which has been deployed in eleven different locations around the world.

Gift eggs ade - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking
The toxic egg scandal has now affected almost all federal states.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have responded and have taken all eggs out of sale across Germany.
Only eggs that have been shown to contain no fipronil are to be added to the shelves.
In this highly balanced performance encounter, Marcus Blasutto’s TSV team consistently matched both teams’ great physical commitment and pleasing commitment.
The Council is currently examining the inclusion of these mechanisms in Article 7.
For example, we ask the rapporteur, the Commission and the Council to supplement the agricultural policy part with the fisheries policy part, for example by using the title 'agricultural aspects of enlargement' as 'agricultural and fisheries aspects of enlargement'.
I would particularly like to address the Council, which is unfortunately largely absent, but which has some expectations and concerns.
The compound feed industry has again tried to influence the Council and overturn the open declaration.
I would like to point out to the honourable Members that the Council working group unanimously decided to recommend to the Council that a joint committee be set up in the action programme which, by combining the management and consultation procedures, can increase the influence of the individual Member States.
In our view, the report contains a disagreement on the question, which my group does not agree on, namely whether the appointment of an internal auditor should be made only for the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament, or even for the smaller institutions.
Let me give you two examples: the Education Council, together with the item on the agenda concerning the mobility of students and teachers, because we have seen a great disparity in mobility, and the Internal Market, consumption and tourism Council, in conjunction with the item on the agenda on the development of e-commerce, in order to make it accessible to all men and women, because here too, as we know, there is an inequality between women and men.
I must therefore admit that this amendment, as the Council and the Commission have said, is not justified in this case and I would like to take this opportunity once again to remind you that the procedures for import controls in the European Union do not work, that fraud is committed and that these frauds are not only bad for Community taxpayers, but also bad for the functioning of the internal market and even for fairness towards third countries.
The Commission and the Council will do yours, and that is the most important thing currently on the agenda in Yugoslavia; that has always been our interest.
As far as the Intergovernmental Conference is concerned, I believe that the work in front of Biarritz at ministerial level has already progressed as far as possible, and the informal Council was therefore at the right time to confirm certain progress in order to provide guidance for the final phase in which we are now in.
Madam President, I would firstly like to congratulate the European Council on having adopted the draft Charter as binding.
Fulfilling the demands of the large countries for more power in the Council and in Parliament would upset the balance within the European Union and lead to the small countries paying the full price for enlargement.
We must support the efforts of Mr Prodi and Mr Patten to strengthen the Commission's ability to act through parliamentary insight and the necessary parliamentary control, which is not the case with the Council and Mr Solana.
Even though we share the criticism of the Council on many points, it remains to be seen that it would be a politically impossible confrontation and would undermine credibility in European institutions.
I do not want to get the impression that the Council is not answering the questions put to it.
The Council is actively considering the Commission's proposal and the amendments mentioned in order to reach an opinion on this issue as soon as possible.
At that time, we did not know that the Council and the Commission had promised aid from these funds for reconstruction in Serbia and Kosovo.
Mr President, the Council has really surpassed itself in the draft budget for 2001.
In this respect, and also in view of the Commission's admission that the Member States' demands for payments for the Structural Funds for 2001 exceed the estimates of the PDB by EUR 8 billion, I think it is time for the Council to give very serious consideration to the fact that we should do something about the payments and not increase the RAL.
In due course, such support and signalling will also be required vis-à-vis the Council.
Several proposals are already before the Council and Parliament, such as the package of proposals for recasting and updating the hygiene rules.
I would therefore ask you to convey to the Council, which is not here, and to the Commission the importance of increasing this amount, since, unfortunately, between 20 and 50 new mines are being laid for each mine cleared.
Abolishing the requirement for closer cooperation under the Treaty and the abolition of the right of veto and the possibility of presenting the subject to the European Council would be a breach of fundamental principles of European cooperation within the EU.
Last October, the General Affairs Council approved the first five action plans for Somalia, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Morocco and Iraq.
The competent committee followed me in this, and the signals from the Council are also positive.
The Council will have to ask itself whether it has done more harm than good by granting Turkey candidate status.
At its meeting in Feira in June 2000, the Council adopted a common EU strategy for the Mediterranean, and the European Commission, having proposed and implemented the reform of the MEDA regulation, recently presented a document on stepping up the Barcelona process.
The Commission and the Council express their willingness to do so.
What diplomatic initiatives does the Council intend to take in the interests of bringing Armenia/Azerbaijan closer together, resolving their bilateral differences and promoting their cooperation?
Secondly, in its response, the Council refers to NATO as Pontius Pilate, without commenting on Turkey's provocative violation of Greece's sovereign rights, this time on the occasion of the NATO exercise.
Other countries, however, desperately want the compensation fund, and I must tell you quite frankly that if we were now to propose the compulsory introduction of the compensation fund, the result would be that we could forget about it, because there would never be a majority in the Council.
Let me give you an example: as you know, there have been difficulties in banning the export to third countries of products deemed unsafe, whereas this ban is very important to the European Parliament and we fully support it.
The Garot report aims to improve on some aspects of the Commission's proposal by trying to find a compromise solution with the Council, particularly on financial participation in the fund.
The Council of the European Union is also playing an active role, in cooperation with your institution and the European Commission, in updating and constantly strengthening European rules to prevent and combat this disease.
The Commission and the Council of the European Union bear a heavy responsibility for the scale of the mad cow crisis.
Parliament can be proud that the proposal to create this academy was born here, and we are grateful to the Portuguese Presidency for taking it up, and thank the Commission and the Council for their support.
A declaration on the economic, social and cultural characteristics of sport and its social function in Europe will also be prepared for the European Council.
His voice would be stronger and the voice of the ministers who defend agriculture in the service of sustainable development would also be much stronger in the Council if it could be based on decisions taken here in the codecision procedure.
As requested by Mr Brok in his report, the Council will have summary documents detailing relations between the Union and the individual partner countries in order to make better use of the Union's overall efforts to improve its efficiency and prepare its debates on external action.
I would also like to say that, in all the positions adopted by the Council, there is no budgetary commitment by the European Union to finance any military activity.
Furthermore, it is completely illogical that only the Council can change the Financial Regulation, and we repeat our conciliation motion on this point.
On many points, as Mr Watts has already explained, the European Parliament has a stricter position than appears to be the case in the Council.
Discussions have also been held with the sectors concerned and there have been numerous contacts with the French Presidency with a view to reaching a consensus text that can be swiftly adopted by the two legislative bodies, the Council and the European Parliament.
I would like to say to Mr Jarzembowski that the Council is not seeking a compromise.
"It is clear that there may be an incompetent and provocative official, but if 15 Member States agree to such answers, I believe, Madam President, that you must take the initiative and urge the Council to respect a prerogative of Members of the European Parliament.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that the debate on proportionality (votes in the Council and seats in Parliament), that is to say on the balance of power between the Member States, has opened up a Pandora's box, which will only be easily closed in Nice.
The report has been the subject of difficult discussions in the Council.
I have been told by my chairman of the Committee on Budgets that this is the first time that an agreement has been reached between the Council and Parliament in a conciliation.
Ultimately, it was the weighting of votes in the Council that was most discussed and where it was most difficult to reach a decision.
As a representative of the groupings of the Free Alliance, I would like to warn the Commission, but above all the Council, in case the EU wants to be no more than an intergovernmental community.
But the Nice European Council, like many other summits in the history of the European Union, represents a victory for reality, a victory for pragmatism over utopia.
If the Council wanted to do so, it would be unconsidered and unwise.
Secondly, has the Council been informed by the Human Rights Commissioner of the Council of Europe, who is well represented on the ground?
What improvements will the Council make to Directive 92/12/EEC, which is referred to here, so that the competences of the supplier and the recipient are clearly defined without the possibility of fraud?
Under Article 23 of the Treaty on European Union, such a decision will be taken unanimously by the Council, as will all other decisions relating to defence policy.
Mr President, as the Groupement Européen des Sociétés d'Auteurs et de Compositeurs rightly points out, the draft we are discussing has been attacked in an excessive manner during its examination by the Council.
Secondly, this issue will be on the agenda next Friday at the Telecommunications Council.
It became clear at the trialogue meeting that the Council is not prepared to make concessions on this issue.
The precautionary principle was also discussed at the Nice Summit, which took note of a resolution adopted by the General Affairs Council.
The 2001 budget is largely based on a compromise between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, which we support.
The Nice European Council had a positive aspect: with the decision on a new weighting of votes and a new distribution of MEPs, with the involvement of the Eastern European candidate countries, it gave them a strong signal of willingness to accept them as soon as possible.
Michelle Carter sentenced for texts urging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to suicide by texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years have been suspended.
Carter was convicted in June of negligent homicide of Conrad Roy, who took life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend.'
Carter was allowed to remain free until appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy were suffering from mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and downward-facing eyes when she was convicted.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She didn't take responsibility," she said.
"She has shown no remorse."
But Carter's attorney said it was a "terrible circumstance she completely regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her "age or maturity or even her mental illness have a significant impact on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying that "there is no day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and as I walk around with everything... I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pains we will carry with us for eternity," it reads.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was "tracked" by the realisation that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
"Not having this only person with whom I have been together since my birth every day is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case appears to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang on, jump off a building, stabbed yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention by Roy's death and ordered that she benefit from the case through any press.
The case has divided legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British co-worker in Italy in 2007 before being acquitted two years ago.
Ms Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."

Joshua Kimmich: Learning from FC Bayern's new mini-Lahm
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is no accident.
FC Bayern dare to give the Confed Cup winner a great season - extra motivation does not harm.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, which saw Joshua Kimme immediately, even if the extra garment was very, very small.
But as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, there was no Philipp Lahm, nor Manuel Neuer, he made up his arm for the binding given to him.
"The coach didn't announce it," the Confederations Cup winner told reporters afterwards, after his first assignment as Bayern captain.
Well, the stand could have been better than the 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign of the coach could also suggest Kimme.
It was not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal who was chosen as the game leader in the C-Elf, made up of young players, debutants and professionals who have just come on holiday, but he.
Sugar is best distributed to those whom you trust and want to keep you happy.
So anyone who has been chosen to take on the heritage of Lahm can only use a little extra motivation.
Kimme acknowledged: "That's what you want as a player: Taking responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flung as a mini-launch across the field.
Right back, that's now his position, the white tie on the arm did its rest.
And in this starting formation Kimme looked like the one who can best take the helm.
He gave instructions, tried to steer the unmarked squad.
He had the view for the whole while many others were self-absorbed.
Vidal by overplaying his lack of fitness (did hardly work); Renato Sanches by starting on devil's way out to the performances of the Asian tour (does not work out very well); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle by not being negative in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
That worked very well.
Süle ran alongside Kimmich, Rudy before the defense, both acting sovereign.
The Naples storm, which was occupied by the name of the name, was often difficult, and Süle also tried to make a success of the game.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not as we hoped."
But he also showed a decent performance on the debut.
Game shift, pace change: "For this style, I was brought up as well."
How unusual this Bayern world is still for the new entrants, one saw after the match.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimme passed away after a few crisp statements in the back of his new players.
There he heard an interesting phrase from Süle: "What's going on here I've already noticed.
At Bayern you just have to win every game."
After all, he no longer has to teach the new.
Alaba motivates ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's most famous footballer reported on Twitter just before the game and wished the ÖFB ladies well.
After all, the Bavarian legionaire is almost a club colleague of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and is fiddling with our ladys.
The tweet from the Austrian Footballer of the Year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational splash.
Our ladies might well need the famous Bavarian-Dusel.
The court heard that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of cocaine after tests found Class A drugs in his hair, wallet, and credit cards.
In court, it was announced that he had appealed to key players in the drug trade, some of whom he had previously represented, following significant arrests and informed them of what investigators knew about them.
We find you and bring you to court.
In court, the defendant initially claimed he was suffering from severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan were killed next to him in an explosion.
The court did not have to hear any of the injured women.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700-page law, and also held that the health-care law’s requirement that states either expand access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise eliminate all state Medicaid subsidies was not unconstitutional.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered outside the court to cheer the new president, and unlike the Mubarak-era Presidential Prunk, traffic was stopped only briefly so that the car convoy could cross the usually bustling street that connects the city center with the southern suburbs.
But by laying the official oath in court rather than in parliament as usual, he is bowing to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Difficult is that in court, rockers almost always abide by a law for them rather than testify.
Business pleased with rhubarb peasant minister: Economy praises Wis. pace
It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister for Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new economy minister, Volker Wissing (FDP), is in office.
Chambers and businesses from the region talk on T V's request of a change in economic policy - while rebuking the old minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Association of Trier Enterprises (VTU), says: "Wissing picks up the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked."
Natus sees the biggest U-turn in infrastructure policy: the gap in Highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list.
Later this year, the ministry is hoping for a planning process, by 2021, to stand the construction right.
A role in the country's plans is also played by the West bypass Trier, which is in the pressing need of the federal transportation plan.
The aim is to bring the route into operation in December 2020, says ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a signpost to prop up regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier, as Wissing suggested, is seeking a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and halt the trend of German wine exports, which have been falling for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praising the IHK.
The Trier Chamber of Commerce sees the new Master bonus as an additional incentive for young apprentices, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 Euros is envisaged for the passed master examination and 2500 Euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years of master training.
The homework list for the country remains long, though.
The planned road construction is fast creating facts, while the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, chief executive of IHK Trier.
Of 56 new engineers Wissing plans to hire at the state-run company Mobility, only 29 have been filled.
IHK is calling for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
CDU Group Vice-President Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country invests more than EUR 20 million less in the maintenance of national roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a country plan to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
It is also disappointing that broadband has been expanded in the country to date.
In 2016, regional companies ranked network supply in an IHK survey only by grade 3.4.
They complained about stalled Internet connections and breakdowns.
In contrast, ex-Economy Minister Eveline Lemke is out of politics at the moment and is still on the board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where, after four months of disagreement, she was already clearing the field.
These lessons have taught them so well that when government officials in Shanghai, who through the low birth rate and the ageing population this summer suddenly began to change course and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their response was immediate and definitive: "At no time."

Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - automakers face backlash
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believed that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the ventures as a recall.
European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to car manufacturers of installing equipment to neutralise the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with molesting powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes, which included the use of so-called shut-off devices that were able to regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car was tested but driving back in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen employees have been charged in the United States, while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in Audi's engine development was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was expanded.
Audi's involvement in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: The luxury car maker disproportionately contributes to Volkswagen's profits.
Instead of immediately helping in the Röszke camp to establish structures that guarantee humanity, our Chancellor has, unofficially and publicly, brought the attitude of the Hungarian Government into the orbit of Nazism.
When negotiations began six months ago, it was Britain's turn to take over the presidency at the European Council.
That is exactly what the European Commission did recently when it presented its first strategy for the post-Kyoto era, which the European Council will discuss in March.
The Commission has the task of monitoring the practical application of this legal framework within the framework of its role established by the Treaty.
I therefore consider it entirely appropriate, in this case, to entrust an external and morally indisputable authority with this task.
That remains a task for the future.
Madam President, it has been mentioned what the role of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs could be.
Enlargement has presented you and all of us with the same task that Monnet and Schuman and others faced fifty years ago: to develop a method, a structure and a vision for the future of Europe.
That message has the float on Saturday at Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for Isar visitors to join us, tomorrow Saturday a raft will sail through Munich, which has a special message.
If you go to the Isar again on Saturday, you will see a big raft there between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And that's not a common raft, with Isar tourists.
Instead the building department wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a large information banner.
It shows a pile of rubbish.
The prelude to a publicity campaign to appeal to Isar visitors.
The motto "Wahre Liebe ist ..." is to sharpen the understanding of the Isar as a protected wild river.
Last summer the raft sailed over the Isar and again this year there are further actions and measures to achieve considerate and environmentally conscious behaviour.
The European Monetary Cooperation Fund (EFWZ), chaired by a board of directors made up of members of the Committee of Presidents of Central Banks and a member of the Commission, is primarily responsible for ensuring the functioning of the European Monetary System (EMS) created in March 1979 as a substitute for the 'snake'.
However, this monetary mechanism of the EMS is different from that of the 'snake' because the EMS has been accepted by all Member States (where the UK and Greece are not yet involved in the intervention mechanism), so it is a Community system.
However, this monetary mechanism of the EMS is different from that of the 'snake' because the EMS has been accepted by all Member States (where the UK and Greece are not yet involved in the intervention mechanism), so it is a Community system.
This was the mechanism known as the 'snake in the tunnel' (European monetary snake).
The 'snake' represented the narrower range of variations permissible for intra-Community exchange, while the 'tunnel' was the larger range of variations allowed for the exchange of common currencies in dollars.
Meanwhile, the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (1973 established to manage the snake in the bandwidth mechanism) continues to serve as a precursor to the new institution.
It is forbidden to hunt, catch, disturb, kill, kill, damage, sell, transport or hand over to other people completely protected animals (in Upper Austria this is the majority of birds and snakes as well as all lizards and amphibians).

ZIELE c. In 1972, the "snake in the tunnel" mechanism reduced the variations between the common currencies (snake) against the bands between these currencies and the dollar (tunnel).
They joined the price stability mechanism and stepped out, and the snake, originally conceived as a community-wide arrangement, was reduced to a zone of currency stability around the DM.
(snake) to ±2.25% and to limit the volatility between these currencies and the dollar (tunnel) to ± 4.5%.
Community losses of 2.25% (the 'snake') were further applied by the original Member States of the Community and Denmark; the fluctuation of these currencies against the dollar (the 'tunnel') was limited to 4.5%.
The return of the French franc to the queue, the relatively satisfactory functioning of this system and the introduction of a European accounting unit were characteristic of this development.
In 1975, negotiations were held on the inclusion of the Swiss franc in the "snake" to contribute to greater exchange rate stability in Europe.
The logical consequence of this was that there were always difficulties in the currency markets: the French franc dropped out of the 'snake', the pound and the lira had to suffer steep falls in international currency markets, and the Deutsche Mark was upgraded to relieve the queue.
Re-adjustment of intervention rates within the "snake"; the benchmark rate of the DM is upgraded by 2% compared to the ERE.
Within the "snake," two exchange rate adjustments took place, both involving Scandinavian currencies.
In setting prices for 1978/79, this border compensation was reduced, but increased again as a result of exchange rate changes in floating currencies and appreciation within the snake.
During the start-up period of the system, non-snake Member States can opt for a little more bandwidth for a limited period of time.
The question remains whether it will be able to resist the ups and downs that brought down the "snake."
The former "floated," the latter were involved in the snake and could only fluctuate in a given frame.
In the EMS, the unit of account valid for the 'snake' is replaced by the ECU corresponding to the value of the ERE, which is about 21% below the value of the 'snake' unit.
However, the UK and Ireland, followed by Italy, are leaving the "snake."
However, the European Rut has also had undeniable success: the British renegotiation of 1975, the general direct election of the European Parliament and, on 12 March 1979, the introduction of the European Monetary System (EMS), which replaced the 'snake'.
This construction was known as the 'snake in the tunnel', with fluctuations between the common currencies forming the snake and the external fluctuation limits permitted by the IMF.
The three candidate countries, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark, joined the queue in May 1972, but failed to comply with the associated discipline and left the queue after a few months.
In early 1974, France and Italy also left the queue, leaving only a small number of currencies under the leadership of the Deutsche Mark.
This was the birth of the 'snake in the tunnel'.
The snake was thus half as wide (2.25%) as the tunnel (4.5%).
In addition, it was decided that interventions aimed at keeping European currencies in check should in principle be carried out in European currencies, while dollar intervention should only be allowed to prevent the snake from breaking out of the tunnel.
The EEC Commission subsequently proposed a common float of European currencies against the dollar - that is, keeping the snake but leaving the tunnel - including the possibility of changing parities within the snake within certain limits and under certain conditions.
In September 1974, French Finance Minister Fourcade proposed a plan for a "coordinated floating" of all Community currencies, through which closer coordination should be achieved between the five snake currencies and the four separate floating currencies.
As a starting point, he recommended the previous queue but wanted to surround it with a kind of wider and more elastic "Boa," into which the outside European currencies would be included.
This outer shell may have wider bandwidths than the snake, and may include an option to join and exit currencies.
In December 1975, the Belgian Prime Minister, Mr Tindemans, in his report on the European Union, developed a series of proposals to consolidate the snake, which should be of a Community nature and extend its action to the key areas of economic and monetary policy.
According to Leo Tindemans, strengthening the snake should also encourage the gradual return to more international currency stability, with as a first stage greater stability zones in the world where exchange rates would be held stable.
This target zone for floating currencies should gradually move towards the snake to the extent that the weighting would shift in favour of the snake.
Some may see in the European Monetary System nothing more than an enlarged and revamped 'snake'.
As with the snake, membership of the EMS is also voluntary.
Although France, Italy and Ireland chose to participate alongside the former snake countries (i.e. BR Germany, Denmark and the Benelux countries), in 1978 Britain decided to remain outside the exchange rate mechanism, which is the main part of the EMS.
The commitments associated with participation largely resemble those within the snake: One currency may fluctuate at most by 2.25% relative to another on either side of its bilateral parity (for the Italian lira, however, this bandwidth currently stands at 6%).
- The distance between these two ECU courses serves as a basis for calculating the deviation indicator, which is a novelty of the EMS compared to the snake.
There has been a long discussion about whether the duty to intervene should be determined in relation to the ECU or using the parity grid according to the snake's example.
However, the Member States that did not belong to the 'snake' in December 1978 (namely France, Italy and Ireland) had the opportunity to choose larger bandwidths up to 6%.
- Internal monetary policies: these include, in particular, interest-rate policies that can directly affect the movement of capital and contribute to easing tensions, as experience with the 'snake' has shown enough.
The mechanism of the deviation indicator has therefore brought two important innovations to the snake system: for the first time there is an objective basis for triggering consultations between the competent authorities, which goes well beyond the mere agreement of consultations left to the participants' initiative.
The entry into force of the Basel Agreement introducing a system of reduced bandwidths in the EEC - the 2.25% snake in the tunnel (+2.25%).
Sterling, the Irish pound and the Danish crown join the queue.
The Danish crown leaves the snake.
The Italian lira leaves the snake.
The Norwegian and Swedish crowns join the snake.
The Swedish crown leaves the snake; devaluation of the Danish and Norwegian crown by 5% against the EEA.
Norway leaves the snake.
Chapter II summarises these earlier attempts, from the wording of a number of objectives in the Treaty of Rome to the concerted floats of certain European currencies in the 'snake'.
Chapter III deals in detail with the content of the EMS and its mechanisms (the exchange rate and intervention mechanism, the role of the ECU, credit systems), highlighting above all the innovations of these mechanisms in comparison with the 'snake' and analysing the conditions for proper functioning in abstracto.
During the start-up period of the system, non-snake Member States can opt for a little more bandwidth for a limited period of time.
Two areas of Community activity have so far been excluded from the scope of the ERE: the transactions of the European Monetary Fund, which were EEA, an accounting unit based on the exchange rates of the serpent currencies, and the common agricultural policy, which used the 'representative rates', the value of which was determined in local currencies by the Council.
The applicant countries are also joining the 'snake'.

Mordillos Knollennasen and the Laugh Against the suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most-published cartoon drawers, the tubers of his characters are his trademark.
Even at 85, the Argentine is still drawing and working on a film.
His message: Laugh, "because there's too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932, as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In his first years as an artist, he struck out, among other things, as a drawer for greeting cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when lost in my job," he once said.
After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he made a breakthrough at the end of the 60s: with the release of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
The artist has always been inspired by cities.
Large, run-down Mordillo figures tucked into drawings with the Slate Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
According to his own figures, he is still sitting at the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
Through calendars, jigsaws, books for young and old, T-shirts, plasters and watches, his dark figures continue to be widely distributed around the world.
For six years he has also worked on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters.
The main person in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - murderillos' most popular animal in its drawings - who has a thousand-five-tonguer as an opponent.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which is due to be released on the cinema screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they will say, it's strange for me," Mordillo says.
The script is not written by him.
That's why he relies more on the TV series, which, like its original drawings, is wordlessly produced.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to meet its obligations, France spends just 10 cents and means a comparable wager.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
He has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that he is under threat from climate change.
The lavender is in decline because of conditions reminiscent of drought and disease-carrying insects, causing major headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant has been exposed in recent years to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the life span of lavender.
There is also a small cicadas, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are very many of them."
And there is a lot at stake.
Lavender oil attracts not only holidaymakers, but also perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
Solutions being considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and developing varieties that are more resilient to drought.

The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told it was important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists are discussing what feels safer: They are supposed to take their children to the office, which in 2009 was the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a plaque at the front of the room: Opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and abdominal feelings are enough.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the government's payroll or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make Mexico's chaos dangerous.
There is no respite from the violence, and as bodies pile up across the country, more and more journalists are present: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far this year there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter is its editor and its inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.
His absence is deeply felt, though his presence is everywhere -- a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hanging on the facade of the Riodoce building -- two reporters in the Thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only two criminal proceedings have been initiated.
As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating Sinaloa's violence, although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is now even more treasonous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we distrust everyone."
On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan.
He managed only to drive a few blocks wide before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men, he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times at him, presumably because of the newspaper's name - which translates as "Twelve River."
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely around Culiacan.
But on Valdez, there is virtually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields as rival factions here struggle to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot in the street, or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "calm" when only one cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Still, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke with the blame for failing to protect his friend.
He believes two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the release of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have angered the sons, suspected gang members bought every copy of the issue once it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after seizing another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He was an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he teamed up with five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold $50 stakes.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to engage in journalism without encountering the narcotics problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot" award for her reporting in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in prosecuting Mexico's drug history, wherever it led.
He admitted voluntarily that he was afraid.
"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV.
"You have to do the job that suits you as a journalist - either that or you play the fool.
I would not like to be asked: 'What did you do in the face of so many deaths ... why did you not say what was going on?'
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a dock worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted on his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his demeanour?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive.
"You don't like it when you're dealing with their women, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best of times, is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "a sense that can be deceived ... and then things have happened with Javier."
The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce's staff met for security training, no cell phones were suddenly allowed, and days before it was announced that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were ordered by the state government to protect Riodoce's offices in a four-storey building in a mid-range district of Culiacan.
Half in jest, some of the reporters wondered if those officers were among the 50 percent of police officers the governor himself called untrustworthy.
It's been months since the reporters went to the mountain resort where drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's edition, Riodoce has relied on three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on state spending focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word on who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was needed when it became time to write what everyone in the city knows: That the restaurant is a favorite place of drug traffickers and authorities.
One reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost the entire century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at this venue, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have viewed Valdez's column as the most well-informed source on the kidnapping.
"We used to know what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slim body stature.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources have broken down."
Valdez's office was turned into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting the killings of journalists because the staff became something they themselves never expected: Activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning because of another journalist to the prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.

At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez's assassination, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and killing them because they were telling the truth.
She has since asked that she be reclassified by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were " Surrounded" by organized crime, government officials involved in it and an indifferent society.
In his last book, "Narco Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on orders from politicians and security forces, who were under a blanket with organized crime.

Dinosaurs used camouflage to evade his enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
Now researchers have found that the initial findings of the incredible rhino of a Canadian miner were so well received that experts described it as the "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
It was so well received that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said they had something of a "troubled past."
The report in the journal Current Biology called it "the best preserved armoured dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurian who lived in the middle of the chalk season between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well-preserved condition has puzzled researchers who describe it as 'really remarkable'
According to reports in National Geographic, the armoured herbivore is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug at the Suncor Millennium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He met something that seemed misplaced by the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) of earth clumps.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled.
"If you just blinked a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it slept," said the principal author, Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is seen.
"It will go into science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
Researchers found that although this herbivore is covered with an armor and resembles a changing tank, it was probably threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counterlocking, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to blend better into its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurian family first made headlines in May and is now seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours digging it out carefully.
The specimen's astonishing conservation allowed Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of sheds and armor over his body.
They discovered the cone shade, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning the tip of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although dense shade is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favoured the cover-up of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use the contraption shade - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodosaurian was facing a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the chalk age must have been," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur's skin was redbrown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about its life, including its canned intestine, to find out what it eaten as its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was driven out to sea, where it sank on its back to the seabed.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as southern Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaurian is truly remarkable because it is fully covered with canned scaly skin but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the animal's original form," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early chalk season.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it; if you just shave a little with your eyes, you might almost believe he is sleeping."
The chalk season was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs that stood on two legs, permeated the Earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted down by some of its fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tonne heavy monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta sank in the sea after death and was mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug at the Suncor Millennium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the muzzle to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 feet) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tips that raced from his shoulders.
Researchers believe the armoured herbivore was swollen through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial kept its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover rough tanks along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is so 'rare as a win in the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Foamed remains of the skin still cover the hollowed-out armour plates that carry the animal's skull.
His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are spinning upwards.

In the thunderstorm: Mass blasts on A8: Many injured
Fierce accident on Thursday night on the A8: Just under 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carjacking.
There are numerous casualties, miles of traffic jams - and gaffers.
On the highway Stuttgart-Munich (A8) late Thursday afternoon, about 20 people were injured in a mass carjacking.
According to initial police figures, at around 17.00, almost 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, collided between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg district) during a thunderstorm.
At first, no information was available on the exact number of casualties.
It involved minor to medium-weight injuries, a police spokesman said.
A large contingent of ambulances was at the scene.
The A8 was completely closed to Munich.
In the direction of Munich there was a backlog of about ten kilometres long.
As an AZ reporter reports, massive disabilities also occurred on the opposite carriageway - through numerous gaffers.
The fire department noted the vehicle's license plates now face severe penalties.
Shortly after 18:45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car van and a passenger car.

Deutsche Bahn: Group tests 'comfort check-in'
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: Nothing unsuspecting is sitting in the train and sleeping.
Or one is immersed in his work and just has a brilliant thought.
And then: pufff.
If the conductor arrives and wakes up an unmoved person or pulls the passenger out of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the days of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing free ticket control.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your place and devalue the ticket.
A test operation is currently under way on two routes.
"Come up the offer, we extend it.
It is then expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany early next year," a rail spokesman said.
"Comfort check-in" calls the train the ticket devaluation without chargers.
In order to be able to use them, however, certain conditions must be met: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - which most passengers do anyway.
You also have to buy it through the train app that DB Navigator bought, which is anyway the most convenient way of booking your ticket.
Last but not least, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: You get into the train, calling its ticket under "My Tickets."
A button for electronic devaluation appears for test customers.
Train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
When the passenger arrives at Y. when checking the tickets, he knows that there is a passenger with an already devalued online ticket.
So you can continue sleeping, continue working, stay silent.
Check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the railway - which in turn should benefit passengers.
"If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train staff, check in at the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to make their journey time in train more personal," says Michael Peterson, marketing director of DB Ferntransport.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."
Those who often train know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are among the biggest upsets.
Because often one of the passengers does not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or ID card is missing, or any other document you have to show.
As a result, there are endless discussions between train crew and passenger, resulting in poor mood in the section or large area, and delays in checking your own ticket, and ultimately taking time for the conductor to address other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other train numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked.
As one activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.
Just a day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis native sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled across a post from someone from high school.
"The police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it is still on the street," it said.
Confused, since no one else had posted the information on their feed, they closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis area was in the process of tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., live.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body that was outstretched on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought of himself.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She put off her phone to return to tweets about people on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.
There were photos of the police tape and people screaming, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father carrying a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson police have just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman grabbed his rifle and shouted, "I will kill you... animals all."
"It's not common," Ferrell recalled her testimony.
"This is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and can call typical."
At that moment I felt chills.
I was angry and crying.'
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23, she took her 6-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?" in cinemas from Sept. 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, wearing a floral dress and a matching crown, the two had a conversation that they had »about the black experience and the black condition« numerous times before this morning.
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" she recalled of what she said.
"We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take them with me," Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, know not only activism and organisation, but also the different layers of black experience and black constitution, and what we must do to become free to liberate ourselves.
Even though I am lucky enough to give her an experience where she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black woman's child.
I feel I would do her a disservice to keeping her away from it."
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a campground when activists waited for Officer Darren Wilson's possible non-charge.
There, Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to protesters.
Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism completely changed after August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has come."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit?"
That skepticism was fuelled by countless cases of people, often from whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, 'We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently'.
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around death row inmates.
His involvement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed by the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years following Brown's firing.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us... we talk," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me as these people are portrayed, because that is how I will be portrayed."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a messiah leader but a community coming together," Folayan said - she proved to be the film's most open participant.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," Ferrell said and laughed when she first saw the finished product.
"But I understand that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the menacing of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders, following the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in the 2012 film "BlacklivesMatter" on social media, identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," Ferrell said, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women."
She insists, however, that "this is not an affirmative type of action," where Ferrell was selected because of her identity as the heart of the film.
"She was the person who was shaking up that energy," she said.
"It's no accident, though she's been at the forefront because in a life at these intersections as a black, gay woman so much is at stake.
You can feel your energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial links between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell is on probation for 21⁄2 years for blocking a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "a mess."
Yet she clings to a voice and she feels committed to that memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains."
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
"Not front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow hats on the same benches, in the room!"
"Only very little space has remained in the possession of the city and we would like Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it would redeploy the small road and set up seats designed, among other things, for a cafe to which the company would like to rent space.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face recognition system, this 'receptionist' can recognise how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the key words of their entertainment.
From 'dream' to 'size mania': TV readers discuss bite gallery
The Bit Gallery moves people, though it is far from built.
But the idea of a shopping mall at the south end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold barely leaves the issue.
The issue is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."
While the one to the Bit Gallery says, "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be real class" (Nicole's scarves), comes from the other side: "doesn't need a man" (Siggi bashes) or quite plainly, "size mania!" (Lars Scholz).
While supporters are counting on a gallery to attract more customers to the city, which also benefits the rest of the shops, opponents fear that then the pedestrian zone will bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is being planned precisely at the site where the farmers" market hall is located, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will stop at the start of construction work.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - moving to Beda Square with possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We've been buying almost weekly at the Farmers Market Hall for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women always very happy.
We also discovered the buttocks for us.
We would like to see an opportunity to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
Other cities do.
The small market hall in Frankfurt is particularly interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery comes down to the amount of rent.
However, this is unlikely to be very low in the new project."
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping in Bitburg?
Be it clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets, I find that unnecessary.
There is already enough of that in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least retain the market hall.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, are for the most part offered directly by the producer and are also inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not acceptable to a retailer.
It is a pity that special deals are almost non-existent and what remains of them will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall doesn't fit in for me.
And the gallery doesn't match Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the peasant market hall go during construction time?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bite gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the ghost bite gallery already manage to drive all the shops out of Bitburg?"
George Marquet: "That just won't work.
And a shopping center that stands empty doesn't need anyone either.
I think it would have been better to promote a proper farmers' market instead of this gallery.
But there is no room for a farmers' market hall, thanks to the mad many - I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg.
If the farmers' market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A fitting similarity: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room at the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptibly the same - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek tulips and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after making public classified diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance (A matching similarity).
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender and pioneering dissident whose conviction was commuted by Barack Obama when he had only three days left in office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits of how someone could look with these genomic data, created a sharp, if somewhat intellectual commentary not only on the malleability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but has already spoken openly about identifying as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.
By prison, her image was suppressed, so much so that there was only one photograph - a grainy, black-and-white selfie in which Manning visibly sits unwell in a driver's seat and wears a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette fumes and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to create a picture of what these people might look like.
That was the moment she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became disparate post friends, exchanging several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the president would convert Chelsea's judgment and enable them to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would actually call for Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas just days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy coincidence.
There is also something deep and powerful about the opening of the exhibition now, as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further unravel the rigid divisions he was supposed to fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with her outsized signature underneath (the "i" in her family name is marked with a heart), called for an end to the "automatic fragmentation whose basis has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand-feet of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show, by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon), how surprisingly similar, at least in biological terms, we all are.
"What people will hopefully take away from this is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also seen.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so these are 30 of these stories."
The final piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novel.
It shows Manning how she appears with a hands-off phone in hand from the United States' discipline armies like King-Kong.
"If they cold your speech, they won," it reads.
"So never stop your mouth."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," the artist said, greeting her from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose bumps when I talk about it."
Manning hasn't personally seen the exhibition yet - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she was to do it, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulacrums that look like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, as was everything in the exhibition, down to size (5" 2, Manning's stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind their liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of Oxford University sought for killing
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University who is being sought as suspects after a man was stabbed in a luxury apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.
On Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the files from Cook County District Court show.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after multiple stitches.
A community alert system released by the Chicago Police Department says the corpse was discovered on July 27.
Officers received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still pronounced dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating the stitches as a murder while police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now in vacation and had been barred from entering Northwestern University's campus.
"This is now a criminal matter being investigated by the relevant authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to assist the US investigation authorities in every possible way."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him posed.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urges the suspects to face the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received an enigmatic tip saying that something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear if the incident also took place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza's management team issued a statement to residents saying: "The police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are investigating a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving something back to those who brought victims.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.

"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) are implemented.
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in collaboration with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard," Mutko explained on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA's roadmap for compliance with the code, which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, there is nothing to worry about for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria set out in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Regarding the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation as our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake.
All the measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we will not admit something that does not exist."
Mutko’s words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of Russia’s independent anti-doping commission.
Speaking to Russian sales office RSport at the start of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
Nobody intends to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was banned from carrying out doping checks in Russia in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.
However, her was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Authority (UKAD).
After a visit to the organisation's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA director-general Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.

Still, he foresees a slump in interest rates, which banks are trying to offset with increases in fees and the price of loans.
Even as he assumes that the war on liabilities - which punishes interest-rate margins - will abate, the risk premiums that banks and savings banks will have to pay for their emissions to conserve liquidity as compensation for waning profit margins are already being shifted to the price of loans.
"They like to go out, but they pay close attention to prices," he stresses.
The business will go well with those who "offer quality at good prices with good service," he adds, and reminds us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices are most in demand by 25 euros.
"If you make a tender and there are few applicants, your prices will go up."

Such an agreement would have to allow the organisation, through suppliers authorised by it, to meet the demand for low-enriched uranium as a nuclear fuel and after the reprocessing of spent fuel rods at market prices and provide a guarantee for the uninterrupted supply or provision of this service, as long as no breach of safeguards or inspection procedures is found in the plants concerned.
During the negotiations on such an agreement, without giving up the right to build such facilities granted in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, states should voluntarily implement a temporary moratorium on the construction of further enrichment or reprocessing facilities, with the obligation to comply with the moratorium as a guarantee of supply of fissile material at market prices by current suppliers.

The fact that the fine-sounding concept of a common market does not mean much is demonstrated every day by the long truck snakes at the internal borders of the EC.
In the United Kingdom, this distribution took place under inhumane conditions, because pensioners had to queue as they did in the thirties to get their free package of butter.

2,792 jobless workers come to every vacant job in Sunderland, and more than half of the 1981 school leavers had not yet found work when already the 1982 school leavers joined the queue of job seekers.
That last point may seem superfluous today, but so soon after the 'poor period' that lasted until the 50s, every politician was all too present at the empty shelves in the bakeries, the food cards and the long queues in front of the grocery stores.
In the UK, the practice is very different, i.e. there are both really personal conversations, as well as the so-called 'Viehmarkt' where teachers sit at tables in the school hall and parents queue up to change a few short, more or less meaningless words with the teacher in question.

By the end of 2000, however, the consumer, who wanted to pay in euros, often met cashiers who, unaccustomed to this, had to consult their superiors in order to be able to pay, while he himself drew the impatient gaze of those waiting in line.

The motto of 'eGovernment' could be: 'Better on the computer than in the queue', because eGovernment should, in fact, make it possible to run public services via the Internet so that we no longer have to queue up in the offices.

The speech was not agreed with Obama, a meeting that he rejected, citing the upcoming Israeli election.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning the election; however, that figure has dropped from 78 percent last month.
They would do better if he didn't waver the election, because "who has such radical views, I don't know if that's good."

By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, provide anonymity and complaint hotlines to employees, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-suite executives and contact the board directly.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Savage said she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to snap polls and surveys of specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company, which at a glance shows which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can pinpoint why.
Companies come to realize that at the top of the workplace culture must stay so you don't become the next Uber caught up in scandals since a former employee posted a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation, and compliance sector could be worth more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial engineering website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a rising interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber case discredited.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that lets employees report bad behavior.
And when the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the supervisory board.
"The court of public opinion has covered the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.
If a company is found to treat its employees badly or behave unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has deployed Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach its corporate headquarters.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company's headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track employees' complaints.
Now that the company uses Convercent, problems previously hidden by executives who sat in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience with employment," said Vitrano, who heads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies began taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical breaches caused by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took the "social media to get it right" that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge companies with recurring fees for using their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in February financing from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising all capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total financing to $60 million.
These investments come as little surprise, given the interconnected nature of business, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing body of research showing that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only bets.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices belong, and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase engagement and employee engagement, it's no wonder you'll find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture important.
But the data is useless if a company's managers don't take action.
Indeed, when a company asks employees for your feedback, there may be an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change doesn't come quickly enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and discourage employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, which has seen companies rely too much on collecting data.
"Because if you don't follow, employees will ask, "Have you really heard me?
Do you care?
And who you don't care about, why should I?"
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, according to Savage.
And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees, it was driven by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communications training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insights about the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to better retention of workers in an industry known for high sales.
"If you are not required to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers, too.
And if you lose customers, you will lose businesses.

I know how soon youth fades and beauty fades, when in the chalice that happiness offers us there is even a drop of shame, a whiff of conscience; and I do not want victims, no grief, no destruction – that is not to my liking.
This sight of the suffering and sacrifice of another turned my senses away from exclusive reflection on myself.
»Jane, I want to be a brother to you – my sisters will be your sisters – without you making us the victim of your just demands.«
Perhaps I would not have to make this sacrifice to him for long, because only three months would pass before he left.
You might decide to be at hand with me to stand next to my chair – to care for me like a good little warden (because you have a loving heart and a magnanimous soul that force you to make sacrifices to those whom you offend) and that should undoubtedly satisfy me.
»Because you are happy to make sacrifices.«
That I have the pleasure of encircling with my arms what I think is worth – putting my lips on what I love – resting with the one I trust: does that mean making a sacrifice?

It was a very grey day; a matte sky that hung full of snow clouds, wrenched over the landscape; then and when, some snowflakes fell, leaving on the hard-frozen trails and bushes and trees without melting.
Again I looked out; we drove past a church; I saw the low, wide tower looming against the sky, its bells proclaiming the quarter of an hour; then I also saw a narrow row of lights on a hill; it was a village or a hamlet.
Behind and above the summit of the mountains, the celestial arch spread out, deep blue as it was in the twilight; into the sky, the breast image of a woman, painted in as soft and unspecified colors as I could only put together.
Under this sky and above that mountain peak, a violent storm blows.
I love this day, I love this leaden sky; I love this calmness, this silence, this starvation of the world in this frost.
In the kitchen, in the cellar of the cellar master, in the hall of servants, in the large entrance hall – the same life everywhere; in the salons, only peace and quiet were there when the blue sky and the halcyon sunshine of the glorious spring weather sent guests to the park.
It was a warm, livelier, but not a bright, hot summer evening; the meadow workers were busy all the way; the sky, though not cloudless, promised good weather for the days to come; its bubble – where it was visible at all – was mild, and the clouds moved high and transparent.
I don't know if it was a nice, clearer or stormy rainy day; when I walked down the big road, I didn't look up to the sky or down to the earth; my eyes were at my heart, and both were now with Mr. Rochester.
It seemed to be saying: ›my magnificent visions are wonderful, but I must not forget that they are completely unwitting.‹ In my brain I carry a rosy sky and a green, blossoming eden; but I know very well that there is a rough path out there in front of my feet, which I have to walk through, and that black thunderstorms are gathering around me, despite them.
But I did not look up to the sun, nor to the smiling sky, nor down to the awakening nature.
I glanced up to heaven; he was clear; a friendly star sparkled just above the top of the rock cliff.
Full beauty is a strong expression; but I don't take it back and either don't justify it; trains as sweet as the temperate Albion climate only ever mesmerised them; colors as rose-red and lily-white as they are under this cloudy sky, in these damp winds ever produced and bloomed, in this case justify the term: perfect beauty.
I stared at the bald wall; it seemed to me like a sky that was densely covered with bright stars – and each one of them meant happiness, a cloud, a deed!
A fresh wind blew from the west; it came from the hills and brought sweet fragrances of heather and  Binsen with it; cloudless blue in the sky; the stream swelled by frequent spring rain came roaring through the gorge, and bright golden rays of the sun and sapphire inks of the firmament reflected on its surface.
On the evenings of a day whose characteristic was cloudy sky, cold wind and uninterrupted fine, penetrating rain, I came to this house.
He raised his hand and opened the eyelids, directed as it seemed with great effort, looking up to the sky, then looked at the amphitheatre of the forest – but for him everything was emptiness and darkness.
I led him out of the wild, damp forest into the sunny fields; I described to him how juicy green they were; how refreshed the flowers and hedges look after the rain, how sparkling blue the sky is.
Even now it cannot be seen quite clearly; it cannot read or write much; but it finds the way without being led at hand; the sky is no longer a colourless area for it, the earth is not an empty space.
»And just as I chose the highest tree in the forest,« the pigeon continued with a raised voice, »and just as I thought I was finally going, they have to wind down from the sky!
Alice laughed so loudly about it that she had to walk back into the bush, for fear they want to hear it, and when she came out again, the fish bark continued, and the other sat on the ground at the door and looked stupid in the sky.
It had not yet been fully completed; through the undiscovered attic, you could see the grey sky.
By now, the sky had become quite blue.
And if we go up to the cathedral without stopping at the thousand barbarities of all kinds, what started with the pretty little tower, which was based on the average point of the cross vault, and which was as lean and bold as its neighbour, the tower of the holy chapel (also destroyed) but broken higher, sharper, clayer and richer than the towers, in the sky?
Only here did this dome building appear as the wildest, freest, most artful and tapped tower ever to see the sky through its broken cone.
This is evidently listed in view of our cold and rainy skies.
And by opening the window of the cell, he pointed his finger at the mighty Notre-Dame church, which, in the cratered sky, removed the black outlines of its two towers, its stone surfaces and its mighty roof top, and resembled an egregious, two-headed Sphinx that had settled in the middle of the city.
Next to the bedding was a window whose smashed butt disks, like a spider net torn apart by the rain, showed a piece of sky and moon through their broken rounds, which rested in the distance on a dazzle of tender clouds.
In this passionate declaration of love, the gypsy sent a glimpse of heavenly happiness to the dirty ceiling that stood here.

One morning, while the Maisonne rose up at one of those deep blue skies as Garofolo loves to paint his cross-sections on it, the bear in the Rolandsthurme heard a noise of wagon wheels, horses and iron device crews on the Grèveplatz.
It would be just as worth knowing the name of each cloud in the sky.
To his feet, some chickens pictured the bush, crouched the gold beetle in the sunshine; above his head, groups of clouds of sheikhs descended on the blue sky; on the horizon, the tower of the Abbey of Sanct-Victor broke through the hillside with its slate obeliske; and the gull on the hill Copeaux looked whistling as the working wings turned.
The sky was pale and so was the water of the river.
Here it was only Claude who stood upright, and the obelisk who lay; but as the river that reflected the sky widened the depth beneath him, the enormous pre-mountain seemed as bold as any cathedral tower, and the impression was the same.
The façade was shrouded in darkness; in the background, the sky sparkled in starlights.
The air was cold, clouds swept up in the sky, with large white waves streaming one over the other as they crumbled on the corners and represented the icefall of a river in winter.
She slowly came toward him, raising glances to heaven.
The air, the sky, the morning, the evening, the moon, my good friends the painters, the funny tricks with the girls, the beautiful monuments of Paris to study, to write three thick books, one of them against the bishop and his mills, and God knows what else?
Whom do you owe it that you breathe this air, see this sky, that you can still divine your Lerchen head with sillyness and poetry!
Over this flame, one saw the enormous towers with their two ascending and grating fronts, one dark, the other red, and which appeared even bigger in the immense shadow they cast in the sky.
The front yard gleamed and threw a ray to the sky; the wooden pole lit on the platform still burned and illuminated the city far away.
The sky was completely pure.
In the fog, the waters began to flow, the ice cover bare, and the floes began to move; the dull, smoldering rivers flowed faster, and, just Sunday after Easter in the evening, the fog cracked, the dark vault dissolved into white lambs, the sky cleared, and then the right spring broke.
He stood and listened and soon looked down upon the damp, mossy earth, soon after the attentively horrid Laska, soon after the seas of bald treetops that spread before him at the foot of the hill, soon after the dark sky covered by white clouds.
As they spoke, Laska spun the ears, glanced up to the sky, and then gave the two hunters a preposterous look.
She immediately drew him into a conversation with the real French exuberance of kindness, praising him happily because he had such a lovely daughter, and raising Kitty downright to heaven by calling her, although she dabbled, a true treasure, a pearl, an angel of comfort.
He looked up to the sky while his sense was waking.
I just looked up to the sky and there was nothing on it other than two white stripes.

The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It goes to 23 p.m., when a crowd of UCLA football players entertained on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have pulled out their jersey tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes represent a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour practice before returning to Wasserman Football Center the next morning at 6:30.
"This is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminated two-day practice sessions to ease the burden of players, and it actually extended its days -- at least until the final Friday.
That's why UCLA's first three training sessions should start at 19:15 to match the players' already packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of camp nearly a week after last season and during summer school for the first time during Moras' six game time in Westwood practice.
They are expected to hold 18 practice sessions during August 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their kick-off against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA's rule change even as it adds another point to the players' busy routes.
"We put this enormous burden three or four days on it, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
"And they just pushed it through, they continued to placate, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it really will be great."
UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished, which will not be an easy task given the clear lines of sight of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the upscale class already littered with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a goalpost.
Bruins-based players are expected to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora conceded that there could be a problem once those rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
"This is a real problem, and it's not far-fetched to think that people are hiring a room there and then setting out there to record an exercise.
If you have the video tape of an exercise, it's a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking 8.
We will do the best with what we have.
I am not too worried, therefore.
We have a plan."
He declared that it was “well possible” for Francis to ask the cardinals for advice.

Community aid consists of food, medicine and blankets.
Medications, staple foods, blankets and clothing are needed to improve people's terrible situation.

This does not mean an integral standardisation of information collection systems in all Member States, but the adoption of a common standard as regards definitions and methods; this need does not conflict with the need to retain some flexibility in the definition of the ceiling, which must be applied specifically to each Member State and to any legislative provision.
The quantity data on textile fabrics, which are shown in gm in current metres in some countries and in other countries, or the data on ceilings which are given in pieces in some countries and in kg in others, make it impossible to evaluate a company statistics for the internal market.
With this help, the Caritas-Peru blankets and food purchased on site will be distributed and the necessary repair work funded.

Facebook to step up fact-checking in fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to fact-checkers from third parties and then display their results under the original post, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday, saying it is one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in an opinion posted on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning techniques to detect possible false messages and send them to fact-checkers, which will potentially display results of fact-checking from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of whom believe it has also influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the May presidential election, and Germany backing a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hate-filled posturing, as they did before the September elections.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of new fact-checking will be launched in the U.S., France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to finding out which stories are being challenged by fact-checkers of third parties, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," Sara Su, product manager for Facebook News said in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "related article" and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a comic novel: A castle in the history of England
In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze-out music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a moody Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says faintly.
"What a personal relationship, keep this letter in my hands."
'A Castle in England' spans the period from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney, and each story has been illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It's not Rhodes' first book based on an archive: He wrote 2014's "Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories," a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only reacted to the thumbprint on the page of a letter so written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell smoke, because at the time you lit a fire because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if he were there himself.
Ah, I love archives!"
For someone so smitten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I've got my welcome a little overrated") this seems all too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, reviewing the archives and studying the castle's many treasures and curiosities, such as the mounted hyenas on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He wandered through the site and the ruins of the old castle and talked to landscapers, gardeners and sometimes the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "whiskey and started writing."
Scotney's intimate history is relatively unknown since the National Trust only gained full access in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees just started taking care of the archive, which he described as a "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said "Oh, throw it to the attic."
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps showing who owned what: "You could think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch around which the two families fought.
Guys, let's all walk his walk!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse themselves in English history on a wider basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farm uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred at the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex,'" says Rhodes.
"The farm uprising started in that area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the castle's history - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell of the 18th century is depicted, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney: "The masters seemed to be pretty crooks, getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men resolved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-liked guys, with a talent for promoting inheritance."
After ending his deployment at the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go back," he says.
It was like, 'Oh, now I have to come back to life condemned'.

Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of army
Every year in early August in Ankara the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirements and promotions in the officer corps.

The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff's building, as before, but in the prime minister's office.

Over 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the army's ranks - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the mastermind of the coup attempt.
Opposing 486 people to have been directly involved in the coup attempt has been under negotiation in Ankara since this week.
Even the day after the coup, Erdogan had described the coup attempt as a "God gift" as giving him the opportunity to "fully cleanse" the armed forces.
But does Erdogan really control the army?
In late February, the newspaper Hurriyet published an article with the headline "Uncomfort at the Military Headquarters."

Ministry to clean up track for racing shuttle
Time and again in recent months there has been controversy over the future of the racecourse shuttle - now it's supposed to go quite fast.
Before the end of the year, the ailing route on which the tourist train runs is to be built.
In order to secure the future of the racecourse shuttle in the long term, construction work on the route is expected to begin later this year, according to the Department of Transport.
"With the decision to continue ordering and rehabilitating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this link, which is especially important for tourism," Transportation Secretary Klaus Sühl said in Erfurt on Friday.
He estimated the cost of repairing the route at around EUR 2.5 million.
Of that total, the country exceeds 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle will continue to be ordered from the country in the future, is currently being finalized, Sühl explained.
The Ministry and South Thuringia Railway as operators already agree on the technical details.
"This is where the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," Sühl said.
The proposed contract between the ministry and the railway company will be concluded for an eleven-year period.
This should make the racecourse shuttle regular on December 2017.
The Rennsteig shuttle is a popular railway link between the Ilmenau railway stations and the Rennsteig railway station.
In recent months, in the course of a pilot operation, it has been tested whether the track is used by enough many people to order it again in the future.
The track is also very decrepit in parts.

Madam President, there are new victims of ETA, but there are also new victims of Spanish repression: new arrests, new torture, the repatriation of prisoners imprisoned in the Basque country.
Firstly, it concerns the method; it is an unwieldy and opaque procedure which, in reality, excludes the other institutions of the Union and in which governments fall victim to their own maze.
Many victims are small children, terrible impressions, terrible mutilations, the way of life destroyed before it really started.
We must ensure that those who have been innocent victims of the fight against crime - perhaps we should call this collateral damage - are not completely isolated from their families in prisons.
However, in the face of this crisis, we must guarantee both health and food safety for consumers and the income of livestock farmers, as well as the income of butchers, calders and wholesalers, all of whom have been victims of the negligence of national and Community authorities.
Appropriate measures must be taken to guarantee victims of crime the following rights: the right to submit and receive information; the guarantee of communication; participation in the procedure and access to free legal aid; adequate protection of the person and privacy; the right to criminal compensation and the possibility of settling disputes by arbitration.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry
Just as you thought it might not be even crazy in 2017, comes a new report on technological developments in the sex robot sector.
Yes, indeed.
Sex robots are a big thing right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, its shape of nipple and type of fingernail.
"People are making fun of them, but the companies are delivering lots of them, and we're going to see them much more often," Mr. Sharkey said in releasing his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his beliefs, selecting everything from the robot's eye color to the shape of nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more disturbing as many robots possess the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there's the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that's adapted to your personality as best you can," the website of True Companion snapped.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods during the day - quite like real people!
She can be tired of being fixated on conversation or she can be "in mood"!"
There are many troubling aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the underappreciated female traits, the allusions to rape, when you take a step at Frigid (meaning here: reluctant) Farrah, worry one most.
On its website, True Companion compared Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then not have Roxxxy?" the website says.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men, of course, will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes its rising popularity, they nonetheless remain temporarily on the edge of consumer culture.
But what trickles down from the fringe zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is some overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when the rights of women worldwide are under threat, when there is a president in the White House who has boasted of sexually assaulting women.
The most daunting aspect of the TV series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Magd') is not the graphic images, the devout bodies and the outcast eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this doesn't feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as possible (albeit with porn star proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, that they mimic the movement of a real body.
But, to the point, when it comes to their "personalities," robots don't represent real women.
They can't separate from their pet or just walk away.
They have no mediation or a background story, nothing that hints at independence or anything that could disrupt the fantasy of total submission.
In other words, they are favored slaves.

Without these prizes, I would hardly have evolved artistically, aesthetically.
For me, a prize is, first and foremost, a great recognition, as one would otherwise receive in research only for important publications – with the difference that such an award, unlike a publication in specialist circles, shows that one’s own work is also perceived and appreciated by people who are not part of one’s own field.

Trump’s Great Power?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized US voters have also divided small-scale families.
Around Christmas and Harvest, US newspapers gave advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump’s chosen relatives.
We are all supposedly pushing ourselves to burst our filter bubbles.
What has been less noticed is Trump’s power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and has long been involved with Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.
It reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kin with whom she had fought for decades because of politics, is suddenly and utterly strange on the same page.
This is certainly a good thing around the dinner table, but it strikes me in another context that this also entails considerable risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the strength to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the grand possibility that one day his kittens will not repel us.
There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans, who suddenly seem to be the epitome of sensibleness at once compared to his standards.
Today, I find myself afflicted by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's ludicrous version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax returns were) - both of which, in fact, appear to be very mild crimes compared to Trump.
If Trump goes, the next Republican nominee will only have to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of New York's carousel department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need a caffeine.
The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crunchy and the animals are spinning to look over their own shoulders full of fear - extremely sinister and the clipping music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: The views of tall buildings get old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city doesn't live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn't count - but a big roundabout in north London.
The Central Park carousel, however, is still a strangely magical experience, as here two two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go on and all have a great time.
If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week at a mall, I was forced to assess my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pull through my credit card.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option of matching the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to introduce personality into a situation where no one is required.
The poor woman in the mall stood excruciatingly grins while I tired of the experience of stretching her credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius with chest pains transferred from prison to hospital
Pistorius has left prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year he was taken to hospital for treatment of cuts to his wrists, which he told prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cubicle at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he held his girlfriend for a late-night intruder who hid in the cab.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against Pistorius's six-year jail term, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecution Service said it will appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius risks increasing his sentence to 15 years if prosecutors succeed.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
By confiscating cell phones and SIM cards, he undercut women's contacts with the outside world.
The world price of crude oil rose 52 percent this year - last month the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly $100.
In the Budaörser trading triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has also increased by 16 percent this year, but price increases of more than 1,000 HUF have been recorded in all hypermarkets.
After prices in the food markets "galoppled" last December, the inflation rate has not been drastic in percentage terms, compared with the already high, earlier initial level.
The prices for Unicum and living fish remained almost at the same level as last year, while the prices for turkey breastfilets, nuts and poppy rose sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but at Auchan there were 1kg of bread wool for 139 forints.
Also surprising here was the price of a two litre Coca-Cola bottle of less than 200 forint, so the beverage including deposit cost only 257 HUF.
Our calculations showed that Cora saw prices in the Napi basket rise by 15 compared with Christmas prices last year, while Tesco and Auchan each increased by 18 per cent.
Compared to the two most recent Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase showed the price of daily consumables in hypermarkets has risen by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at prices at all.
The price of this car is not exactly popular.
The question still seems uncertain as to the extent to which we can actually act on the stock exchange, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at customer level.
Insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that in the event of a higher risk of accidents, higher contributions are due.
Careful drivers can choose a full-caco with deductible so that full-caco insurance benefits are covered but offered at a low price.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it must pay for natural gas, it will be charged higher transit fees by Russia.
As a result, exports to Western Europe fell, driving up prices dramatically.
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
Prices overall rose 3.0 percent year-over-year.

Following the adoption of the Millennium Declaration by the United Nations, the President of the General Assembly has set himself the task of revitalizing the work of the Assembly in order to reduce its burden by the increasing overloading of the agenda over the years.
If adopting one amendment necessarily means rejecting another, the latter will not be put to the vote.

Articles 1.2 j), k) and l) of the Staff Regulations contain the basic provisions governing the issue of the acceptance of badges, orders, benefits, gifts or grants from bodies outside the organisation (see Codes of Conduct of 2001, paragraphs 46 and 47).
The old Article 1.6 regulated this issue in a provision that banned the acceptance of any benefits by a government and severely restricted the acceptance of benefits by non-state bodies.
With the wording of Article 1.2 j that he proposed, the Secretary-General wanted to express his understanding that the General Assembly should emphatically emphasise the importance of the impression of the strict independence and impartiality of staff, thereby reaffirming the absolute ban on the assumption of benefits by governments.
The Secretary-General will notify all Member States in writing of this principle of organisation on the issue of the acceptance of badges, orders, benefits, gifts or grants, so as to avoid such incidents where possible.
This approval is only granted in exceptional cases and only if acceptance is not incompatible with the interests of the organisation and with the position of the official as an international civil servant.
In accepting such gifts, there is little risk that the integrity or independence of staff will be undermined.
Pursuant to Regulation 101.2 m) of the Staff Regulations, the Secretary General may, by way of exception, authorise an official to accept badges, orders, privileges, gifts or grants from a non-state body which are not covered by provision 101.2 j) to l, provided that their adoption is in the interests of the United Nations and is not incompatible with the position of the staff.

As farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, fourth-graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were discharged into the holidays and into secondary schools.
Three of the school pupils will go to the grammar school in the future, four to the secondary school.
School teacher Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Civic House Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of the school setting, the 29 students of the four classes led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young eagle who grows up in the chicken farm but is then released to freedom.
This was followed by a musical entitled "Der Adler im Huhnhof auf".
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and let it roar from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken, a small eagle came out.
But hoping to make out of him a chicken crushed, the eagle spread out on a high mountain up its wings and dislodged.
After that, classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young gobs who wore cylinders to make the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said schoolteacher Angelika Sitte.
The kitten is different from the other kittens (kitchens), but belongs to them.
He will never be like a chicken, though.
Its provision is to be free.
She wished every fourth-grader that he felt adopted in his new school.
It was followed by a word of thanks to the Members, to the former head of school, Michael Müller, who keeps jumping into bottlenecks and to the parents' representatives.
The chicks age is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She leaves her students very reluctant after two years of teaching, because it was a really great time.
Eventually, they could rely on fourth-graders.
Finally, all students performed a song of summer and holiday time.
There was great joy in the children.
Eight first-graders are already registered for the new school year.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "translate please the first paragraph."
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television, said.
On the morning of August 1, a group of illegally camping people were arrested in Sithonia by police, including the two Bulgarians.
The same day they were released while an investigation is ongoing.
The Foreign Ministry told bTV that Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened controls on free camping and impose significant fines on anyone found to be staying in a place not intended for that purpose.
Controls will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court may impose a fine.

Software update for diesel vehicles: What people need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers need to take part in the action?
The main questions and answers at a glance.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the emission behaviour of cars in emission categories Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.
Euro 4 diesel or worse are exempt.
Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the software updates negotiated are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have cheating software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofitting has been ordered by the Federal Highway Traffic Safety Administration (KBA).
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the next few months, but have not yet given an exact date.
Daimler has been told to write to anyone affected.
If an inspection is required anyway, it will be carried out within their scope.
How long should the total conversions take?
"Hard to say," Smetanin thinks.
This depends on the commitment of manufacturers and on political pressure.
"Because we have seen that car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the issue of the environment so far."
How long should the update last?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It might be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do motorists who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
Presumably foreign manufacturers would follow suit, according to Smetanin.
Is a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars now imminent?
The ACE fears that.
But it is precisely in the regions where driving bans threaten.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale yet.

Every few hours they took a bath, so it was high afternoon when they returned to camp.

All means of getting hot and tired were applied conscientiously, and gradually all the excuses flowed back to the camp, endowed with addictive starvation and then began destroying the good stuff.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
President Trump’s first award promises to become political.
One of the laureates doesn't want to come - in protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the prestigious Kennedy Center's coveted awards.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) as well as the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the scholars.
The awards will be handed out in early December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the ceremony with his wife, Melania.
For this reason, the progressive TV series winner Lear has already announced that he will not participate in the gala.
The New York Times said: "This presidency has chosen to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even depriving them of the means - and that is putting a strain on me."
The 59-year-old Estefan emphasized that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her view.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the US capital.
Past winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.

The government was forced to create a council to write a new constitution: a group of citizens – without politicians, lawyers, or university professors – who made the discussion process accessible to all, and managed to produce, by consensus, a preliminary proposal.
In any case, we can start now by analysing the list of candidates, drawing some conclusions about them and also making forecasts as to who will be seated in the Council.
There are currently 142 registered candidates for the 45 seats in the Council.
Although there has always been a gender imbalance in the protest movement, the candidate list for the council is reaching a new level of imbalance.
While some opponents criticized the voting process and the results, many (if not most) members of the protest movement hailed the council as a triumph of cooperation and mobilization.
In the near and distant future, the Council will certainly take a stance on similar brisk issues.

We make the city liveable
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city builder, is retiring next year.
The job is already advertised - but suitable candidates are rare.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And the work is still great fun for him, as he conveys in the press briefing.
He reports varied but demanding tasks awaiting his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application meets the requirements profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest opportunity.
For example, while respecting the regular notice periods, there should still be enough time to start work.
Since Haslach acts as the Lower Building Law Authority for the Administrative Community, the Applicant must have corresponding qualifications.
Because that function definitely wants to keep the city.
If they could no longer fill it, citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But proximity is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports on a good business climate and good mood between authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some major projects have accumulated, with Wacker looking back with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure about the building's office and its staff.
However, varied projects are also on the agenda in the future: the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen parking lot, for example, has been initiated.
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, the stadium renovation is still the subject.
The latter alone will contribute around EUR 1.5 million, 'if we get it right', Mr Wacker reckons.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun."
There is a lot of room for a builder to design.
With Haslach's own farmhouse and gardening, many things can be responded to in a fairly flexible way.
"You can move a lot," Wacker said, and the design of the greens is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the Old Town is listed as an ensemble, it is important to have "an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city builder stresses.
In any case, the builder has a great responsibility.
He's a builder, "in the end everything is going over my table here."
In terms of care and coordination, he can count on long-term employees: Markus Neumaier (high construction) has been present for ten years, and Manfred Schöner (deep building) has been doing so for 15 years.
Also, that his successor remains long, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really identifies with the place and wants to stay."
Continuity is important not only for a good working climate, but also for the further development of the city.
According to the City of Haslach, anyone wishing to bury Roland Wacker should be able to have a completed degree as a graduate engineer or bachelor with a specialization in architecture and have good expertise in the fields of design and planning law.
The Municipal Building Office is responsible for high- and low-rise construction, construction planning, land-use planning, management of urban properties, urban farmyard with building yard and municipal gardening, as well as Lower Building Law Authority, including monument protection.

Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims just the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and blisters, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestine are patrolling to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of causing inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
If the balance tends too far toward inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments have found that a type of tolerance-enhancing immune cell occurs in mice carrying a particular bacterium in their infestations.
And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the cell's appearance.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a bacteria species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiom, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel militia when the same system also works in humans.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, housed separately, did not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the mice's intestinal microbiomas - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The fertilizers of the mice were DNA sequenced and there were six bacteria species found in the mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing in the mice.
Mice were reared in a sterile environment so they lacked an intestinal microbiom and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells, and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells emerged.
To understand how the bacteria had an impact on the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the fluid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
Immune cells evolved into tolerable cells.
When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3 milk acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the lining of the mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan side products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something we would like to encourage as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri may lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have committed a 'genius' with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, with Nemanja Matic having signed a "genius," Jose Mourinho believes after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Chelsea's £40 million signing began with a 2:1 win in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday, and impressed in the keeper's role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched at will.
However, Matic had been ruled out of the Blues' pre-season tour and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later."
Besides Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho formalised his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted three more new commitments but insisted the club had already done a "fantastic job" in meeting three of his four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, for that I thank the club," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they took a lot of trouble."

New low for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader, Social Democrat prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections.
Just no trouble from party headquarters, just no headwind from the federal government - that was the primary wish of the campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the Willy-Brandt-Haus staff have been watching events in the SPD-ruled state capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz has got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described with headwinds.
It was low-scoring.
One by one.
The federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens after the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony.
"This shows once again: Red-Green simply cannot govern reliably," CDU General Secretary Peter Tauber told the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprise resignation of a Green MP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the general election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and the FDP.
Greens deputy leader Michael Kellner has called on the breakaway Lower Saxony Greens MP Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
Passing the CDU clearly distorts the will of the electorate.
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate," the Federal Executive and Campaign Director of the Greens told the editorial network Germany (RND).
"This must not be true at all," one SPD campaigner sighs as Friday morning's new hiatus reaches party headquarters.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is standing without his own government majority after the transfer of the Green MPs Elke Twesten to the CDU.
It is the preliminary culmination of a series of large and small crises in SPD federations.
And no one knows what comes next.
The plight began with the unexpectedly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no more, calmed the comrades at the time.
After the elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
It also became - and it all became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into disarray, and the Dusseldorf impasse swept the party smoothly.
The comrades laboriously rapped again in the weeks that followed.
Then, just as they had created new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.

Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD leader, lost his nimbus that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned.
And because, in crisis communication after that, he pretty much got everything wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
Now also Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW exhaust emissions affair and its role on the supervisory board, the Dutch Prime Minister has been critical for a long time.
Giant poll numbers added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil has tried to focus more and more in the last few weeks.
The desire of the former mayor of Hanover to increase his power in Berlin was not concealed by comrades close to Martin Schulz.
They allowed him, because they promised Weil to stabilize the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
In fact, Weil is not to blame for the partisan bickering of the Lower Saxony Greens.
And Schulz certainly not.
For now, the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed.
Her anger is directed at the Greens, and here in particular at the breakaway parliamentarian Twesten.
"It's unbearable and democratising how Ms Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party's left wing in the SPD Bundestag, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has been elected to parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but via the Land List of the Lower Saxony Greens, according to the Lower Saxony MP.
The logical consequence would be to return her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary group, laments an "undemocratic manoeuvre."
"The voter intent four years ago was clear: The people turned Stephan Weil into prime minister," Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony-based SPD as the top candidate in the federal election, told the RND.
"Well, the personal career thinking of a future CDU MP distorts the election result," Oppermann said.
He called for the background to be clarified.
I want to know whether there has been more or whether there have been further commitments from the CDU in Lower Saxony.

«The customs officers will not be surprised if they are standing in front of a 20-kilogram suitcase full of cards, and I tell them that I would just come home from a exchange shop», says Antarez.
Antarez kept himself afloat with prepaid, sim, and refill cards, but when the supermarket’s mundane casserole charged up the call balance, after about 30,000 phone cards, it was funny.
Often Antarez gets the cards stacked equally.
«Ten years ago, my wife and I in the U.S. were on the cards of Starbucks, which I liked so much that I started to collect immediately and expanded the focus on maps of all men's stores and countries», says Antarez.
Worldwide, there is only one nation from which he does not yet have a map:
The smaller the circulation, the more remote or closed a country, the higher the value of a card.
Well, there's no handy, somewhat stable market for cards.
«I send 100 cards – mostly foreign – to a collector’s colleague that he still lacks and receives 100 from him that I do not yet own.

«He could not answer me at first, but the next morning there was a bag of used cards on our breakfast table.

He also receives support from various companies and businesses in which he has spoken and who are now putting cards aside.
In total, the collection of Antarez comprises around 60,000 cards of all types as well as around 100,000 doubles.
In a moderated workshop on total assets, all the cards were put on the table and the replacement of the company was discussed.

If, in a given year, one of the above-mentioned ACP countries is not in a position to supply the set total quantity and does not wish to benefit from the measures set out in the following paragraph, the Commission can divide up the amount of the total annual quantity to the other ACP countries covered by the scheme.
The third paragraph regulates the application by the Commission.
However, the more important provision of Article 109j is contained in paragraph four:
It refers to a passage in the formal declaration of the European Council of Stuttgart of June 1983 (paragraph 2.3.7. last paragraph):
At the end of the explanations, the following paragraph should be added:
However, paragraph 2 has a third paragraph:
What does this third paragraph say?
The last paragraph of the amendment suggests that work should be carried out mainly through research contracts and partly by the Commission's Biology Group in Ispra at the Joint Research Centre.
I would therefore ask you, Mr President, to put the first paragraph to the vote separately from the rest of the text.
Rules 14, paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 6 of these paragraphs are to be replaced by the following single paragraph:
The explanations must be changed by adding the following paragraph:
The amendment to this paragraph writes hot water showers during working hours
The explanatory statement on page 8 states in the last paragraph:
So either a single amendment replaces everything - and this has been the procedure so far - or it will be voted on individually on each paragraph.
However, it will amend this paragraph in such a way as to make it clear that fares must cover the airline's direct operating costs on the route in question and that state aid granted under Article 93 of the Treaty deducts from the airline's costs who can.
I would ask the Commissioner to confirm that the Commission intends to carry out the investigation mentioned in the second paragraph.
I would therefore ask everyone here to pay attention to the last paragraph of this motion for a resolution, in which we recommend a joint study to be carried out, in particular by the Committee on Agriculture and Development, of all the new aspects arising from the introduction of new techniques and products in the sugar sector.
The last paragraph of Article 3 only takes up the right of initiative granted to the Commission by the Treaties.
There is a paragraph in this agreement which says that the Council of Ministers should agree to close the budget gap in 1984 and 1985.
As regards respect for human rights in the Community, the Council recalls that the Member States approved the following paragraph of the preamble when ratifying the Treaties establishing the European Communities:
It attaches far too much importance to a subcommittee of the Senate, which does not in fact have any power, and it does not sufficiently deepen the issue in the other paragraph.
In the French version, the expression 'from the European Parliament' was missing, thus losing all meaning to the paragraph which was discussed at great length in the Committee on Development and Cooperation.
However, a paragraph in the resolution tabled by Mr Herman and his party colleagues requires a comment from our side: we are astonished that the Commission's proposals are considered to be short-term.
We voted on the first paragraph of Rule 102a, but, as far as I remember, we did not vote effectively on the second paragraph.
It is clear that the House has adopted the first paragraph.
Then this paragraph was voted out by a committee majority.
An amendment which I tabled and which was adopted by the majority of the House is recorded in the Minutes as being rejected and, finally, recital EL of the original resolution has miraculously been turned into a first paragraph of the bulk.
In paragraph III of the last paragraph concerning the Committee on Budgets, the German text again contains the wrong translation.
This paragraph forgets that the Baltic countries are currently part of the Soviet Federation, that their authorities and their peoples know this, just as they also know that the rhythm of reforms depends on that of democratisation in the USSR.
I refer here to Rule 14, second paragraph.
However, when we analyse this article, we see that, according to its first paragraph, the Member States are endeavouring to promote the improvement of the working environment in particular.
Because of a misunderstanding, 16 members of my group voted against this paragraph and two abstained.
However, I realise that this would not have had any effect on the final result, since the paragraph was rejected by a majority of 55 votes.
Can the Commission say whether it has submitted a report on progress in safeguarding social protection in accordance with paragraph Ω of Recommendation 85/308/EEC (x) on the social protection of voluntary development workers?
You are no doubt aware that the first paragraph of Article 146 of the EEC Treaty today reads: "The Council consists of representatives of the Member States.
Firstly, will the Commission accept this amendment to abolish the second paragraph of Article 6?
Because, Mr President, in every paragraph she mentions the issues of the Kurdish question, the Cyprus problem, torture, press freedom and trade union freedoms in Turkey, which means there are problems.
Secondly, it is true that the first paragraph of Article J4 of the Maastricht Treaty reads: 'The common foreign and security policy covers all matters relating to the security of the European Union, including, in the longer term, the establishment of a common defence policy which could lead to a common defence policy in due course'.
I therefore hope that the Commissioner will consult his colleagues over Christmas and invite them to pre-empt my paragraph in the resolution in the new year.
This week in the European Parliament, we discussed, among other things, the Barzanti report, which summarises the opinion of many Members of Parliament.
That was in the paragraph.
However, if we look at Part II of the Minutes, we see that paragraph 1 is a de facto decision consisting of three recitals and a explanatory paragraph.
Funding for local core III
Those who want to rehabilitate their old house will soon be able to get support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives informed STEG City Council on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the event, Schindler gave another look back at what has happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitation areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg still took over two-thirds of the funding.
In the recovery area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60%.
For Schindler, past refurbishments are a "success project" - it is, after all, important to also promote interior development, and not just unlock new construction sites.
On 4 April, the Karlsruhe County Executive received information that there would be a rehabilitation area III.
The funding amounts to EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 would come from the country, the rest from the municipality of Empfingen.
How is a rehabilitation area created?
One will, Schindler continued, investigate where the "really old" houses are.
But it also plays a role in whether there is any interest in rehabilitating the planned area.
If necessary, the borders could then be shifted again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday night.
Keller presented the contents of the Bund-land-programme "Social City" in which the refurbishments would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalization of inner cities, improvement of living and working conditions and maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be taken on an object-based basis, i.e. per plot of land.
The rehabilitation area would then eventually be established as a statute.
Since 1 January 2017, the grant period is still running until 30 April 2026.
Until September of this year, however, the inventory would only be carried out once and for all, with a questionnaire for those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill in.
In November or December, as far as possible, the Statute decision should be taken so that the reorganisations can begin next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the said preliminary investigations.
It is about assessing urban grievances and deciding when to rehabilitate and to what extent.
A cleaning notice will then be entered in the Land Registry for the respective property.
Pietzschmann himself will come to Empfingen again and get a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that the participation of the participants was an essential success factor for the project.
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be mailed to citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and plot sheet" which deals, among other things, with the building condition and rehabilitation intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "budgetary and housing arc," details of the size, division and residents of a living room can be made.
The blue "operation sheet" can only be filled in if business premises are operated in the building.
However, note that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not simultaneously a request for funding.
Moreover, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler still stressed that the distribution of funding was operating according to the "grey principle" - whoever comes first, grinds first.
You can't "reserve funding" for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown in order to make the attendees "smackable".
British inventor sets himself a microchip to come in with a hand movement in house and car
A British inventor is the first in the country to be fitted with a microchip so he can open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and is now offering the service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr Geoff Watson, an advisory anesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dogs implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company also wants to change the locks on homes and cars so they are compatible with the chip, all for an extra charge of £300 per lock.

White House advertising costs cost taxpayers thousands
The White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military's data, which was left to TIME magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, made in Connecticut, was issued next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a piecemeal order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," the commander of HMX-1 wrote to his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation, on the eve of the event.
The news showed that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn at 15 o'clock on 17 July at 7 o'clock in the morning for the event, and until the lawn was cleared between 18:00 and 21:00 this evening.
The note adds that if departure from the White House were to be delayed, a second crew would be required for the return flight because of the restriction of service hours.
The original flight crew was in the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained on the ground with the aircraft during the period.
Records provided to TIME did not indicate clearly whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records show that HMX-1 asked if the event could breach the provision.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Kling as if you're closed," the deputy commander replied.
The "Made in America" event was designated an official by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave a push for health care reform, which was underway in the Senate, and he promoted efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for the trip.
But asking for their use only for photo surgery is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February, when the presidential plane operated taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of messages complaining about his predecessor’s use of the presidential plane.
"The White House is excited about the show "Made In America" -- which showcases products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials," said White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often conduct training flights in the area around Washington and the South Lawn to remove the US president at the White House with precise centimetres.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 led 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted in the flight crew's training needs for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said taxpayers did not take on the burden for any of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in putting out the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to hourly tariffs by the US Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the VH-3D refund rate is $24,380 per hour of flight.
Records of the unit recorded the plane's flight time as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility at Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below that rate.
"To set the cost to taxpayers based on the estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include staffing, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, reimbursement rates for DoD do not include staffing costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contracting.
At that time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the helicopter's use for the event.
"The idea is to present this week things that are made in America," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to emphasise this."
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire truck.
At the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of them."

Narco's Season 3 trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be central to Netflix's hit series
Despite Narcos' second season exposing Pablo Escobar's killer, the Netflix series is far from over.
Seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first received its first trailer and showed the show's latest villains.
With the third season, the DEA turned its attention to the world’s richest organization of drug trafficking: the Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful punters, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican compound, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type who invites American and Colombian law enforcement officials to support the war on drugs.

Role backwards: The city is providing 46 kitchen aids
The town organizes the kita lunch table itself again.
With fixed contacts for children and a team assignment.
In city daycare centers, the clock is turned back.
On September 1, the city of Krefeld takes care of food in the municipal day-care facilities (Kitas).
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of the Department of Youth Aid, this is good news: "We were all very pleased."
A caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked chilled.
The town operates 46 day-care centres in the Krefeld area, and in 44 children get a warm meal at lunch time.
In the past kita year, 2800 children sat at the tables each, and demand is growing.
"Mittlerweile not only eat children who are cared for 45 hours of the week, in the kita for lunch," Pommeranz explained.
"The offer also applies to 35-hour care if children stay until 14."
From 1 September, 46 part-time staff will have kitchen services: they will warm the dishes supplied, supplement them with salad, raw food and fruit, individually portion the meal, give out the food, vacate, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - decides the amount of hours.
"The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the kita team," Pommeranz says satisfied.
"So they're much more involved and it's easier for kita leaders to implement pedagogical concepts."
It is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons.
"The children are supposed to help prepare the food."
The direct connection of kitchen power to the team makes sense.
For the children, too.
"They have a known force in the kita, a person familiar to them, and not constantly changing people."

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men, aged 19 and 23, were reportedly trying to deprive a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police, the men spoke to the 13-year-old, who was staying with friends at Kolping Road, at around 14.55, because they wanted to phone the girl's phone.

As a result, one of the offenders tried to grab the girl's cell phone and necklace, but that failed.

GMB concerns over investment in McVision factory in Glasgow
A union wants to reassure managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production at their factory in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company was silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he had invested more than £5 million in recent years.
He added that staff and union representatives would "be the first to know" if their activities were to change.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland asked McVitie's to "speak concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines is not being pushed forward."
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we can't gain clarity from the general site manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross affects our members deeply.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is heavily focused on the local community and the wider Glasgow area, an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social deprivation.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and welfare, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic output decline, the east end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie."
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The store manager at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly as we appreciate the continued engagement with staff and union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, at which some questions were openly discussed.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our divisions and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a production site, and if our operations change at the site, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to know this."
»My uncle Reed is in heaven and can see everything you do and say; and my father and my mother also; they know that you lock me in all day and that you only wish I was dead.«
Just two or three days ago, I buried a young child of five years – a good child whose soul is now in heaven.
»Let your light shine before the people that they see your good works and praise your Father in heaven.«Ev.
And then my soul made the first serious effort to comprehend what had been laid in it in relation to heaven and hell; for the first time I looked around me and saw in front of me, beside me, behind me, nothing but an immeasurable abyss; for the first time, my soul shook horrifiedly, she felt nothing more secure than the one point on which she stood – the present, all other thoughts, a formless.
»You are sure, Helen, that there is a thing called heaven; and that our souls will go there when we die?«
›Go to the fourth finger of my left hand and I belong to you and you belong to me; and we will leave this earth and look over our skies.‹
She was close, and since I did not send a request to heaven to avert her from me – since I had not folded her hands, bowed her knee or moved her lips – she came: in large heavy waves, the electricity was still brewing above me.
I could defeat the housing, but the inmate would fly to heaven before I could call myself the owner of the earthy shell.
Without a doubt, St. John would have given the world, had he followed it, called it back, withheld it when it left it; but he did not want to give up an atom of his aspiration to heaven; he did not want to give up a single hope of true eternal paradise for the Elysium of their love.
But then she raised her old lament: »Oh, why did the sky so wish?
He regretted it, but then he said that in some respects the sick must rejoice, because it is the Lord will that gives him the opportunity to reconcile with heaven.
The hands folded, she raised her head and looked up to heaven.
Thanks to heaven, he had weathered this journey happily and had arrived in Rome without an accident.
It is heaven.«
Look for a sign coming from heaven – because the sun is there – to inherit these thousand churches at once.
This young, fatherless and motherless brother, this little child who suddenly fell into his arms from heaven, made a new man out of him.
At the points where these currents cut in the sky, they produce light; at their cutting points on the earth they produce gold...
The creature before my eyes possessed the superhuman beauty that can only come from heaven or hell.
She raised her reddish and dry eyes to the sky, to the sun, to the clouds of silver, which were crushed here and there by deep blue triangles and trapezoids; then she beat them down, looked around, to the earth, to the crowd, to the houses... Suddenly, while her yellow man banded the elbows together, she struck a horrible cry, a cry.
It is a death worthy of the sage that has waned throughout his life: a death that is not meat and not fish, like the spirit of the real skeptic, a death that expresses the despair and inconclusiveness that holds the center between heaven and earth, that keeps one in limbo.
The beggars cried, cried, curled, and soared; and Quasimodo, who felt powerless against so many enemies, trembling for the gypsy, and saw the angry faces increasingly approaching his gallery, asked the sky for a miracle, and shook hands with despair.
You will find it in heaven.«
As for Quasimodo, who had not stopped fighting for a moment, when he saw this ferocious flight, he fell on both knees and raised hands to heaven; then, with joy, he trunk from it, and rose up with the speed of a bird to the cell whose entrances he had so boldly defended.
At times, he viewed with confused glances a kind of narrow plate formed roughly ten feet lower from the roughnesses of the Steinzieraths, and he asked the sky basically of his frightened heart that it may be conducive to him to decide his life in this space of two feet in the fourth: it should also take a hundred years.

In Him alone we find peace and consolation and salvation and love,” she said, and began to pray as Alexei Alexandrovich closed her silence.
Of these, he knew none other than Enoch, who was taken alive into heaven.
Shortly before, he knew all the names; but now he had completely forgotten them, especially because Enoch was his favourite form from all over the Old Testament and, in his head, attached himself to the removal of the living Enoch into the sky a long series of thoughts, which he left himself even now, while clutching his eyes at his father's clock and at a button half up.
Alexei Alexandrovich's slowness and indecision, her loneliness, put everything to him.
A heavy thunderstorm came rolling and padded down from the sky and lost in dull groin in the distance.

After finishing, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional sportsman in the world.PSG offers wages of more than £500,000 a week.
Barcelona are furious at the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalan board insists the club has always done its best to care for him since arriving from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect by the PSG president three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club who wanted to sign one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players then we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to have one of our players sign with them, that will have consequences."
Barcelona appear to have crossed that line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to depart under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of that interest by losing one of their price offers to Neymar.
During the day, in the press room, only the image of the presidential meeting without sound was transmitted with the message "private session, limited audio."

All participants were encouraged not only to speak in the course itself, but also to practise at home constantly and to pronounce sentences and expressions.
Each course was completed with a test that was more a test of success than a test.
I would like to take part in the course of further education to the High School."
A course entitled "Racism and Xenophobia in the workplace" was offered to three groups of district administration employees.
This course was aimed at supervisors, foreign-born workers and nursery teachers.
The course should create a positive working environment and help prevent 'cultural collisions', ensure that employees know more about each other, provide more accurate information about political parties' agreements on immigrant and refugee issues and encourage work within the framework of local action programmes.
This course addressed prejudices and hostile attitudes as a result of ignorance, and provided an opportunity for hands-on discussions on xenophobia and racism, with a long-term change in attitudes.
Another initiative is to teach the LO schools about 'introduction to the Danish trade union movement', a course designed to encourage ethnic minorities to use trade unions for themselves.

Against this background, it is not surprising that, after taking over the leadership position, he steered the FPÖ on a straight right course and made public anti-Semitic statements.
I would also like to know why the Commission is stubbornly continuing its course of total ignorance of this Parliament and not opting for a recommendation, as we wanted it to be, but remaining with the directive.
As long as this convergence of ideas and the values behind them is not achieved, we run the risk, time and again, that, in the event of a crisis, the Member States will fall apart and will not find the middle line.
The alternative would be to equip submarines with sensors and other high-tech equipment to detect trawlers and fishing nets so that submarines can change course in time.
This political shift has led the 'Boat People' to refrain from taking a course on Hong Kong and to take the risk of steering their backs to other shores.
We must then determine the course to be followed, because I do not think we should go down the road of confrontation too recklessly.
But we in the Socialist Group all too often had the impression that the Commission was off course sometimes imperceptibly but always in a negative direction.
If we continue to steer this course in agriculture, we will have fewer and fewer farmers around ever larger farms, more and more pesticides, more and more fertilisers, ever greater threats to the environment, while on the other hand we will be spending money trying to protect the environment.
The troika, which is in charge of the social sector from Ireland, Italy and Luxembourg, has agreed on an approach which, in our expectation, will make it easier for the Council to keep track of the objectives of the action programme arising from the Social Charter.
At the moment we are blindly pursuing a course which will destroy a large proportion of small family farms, which have always been guardians of rural nature.
The truth is that while DG VI is steering a course of vertical legislation with its own rules for each food product, DG VI is not directly responsible for food hygiene.

The honourable Member will be aware that the Community and its Member States have repeatedly expressed their concern at the deterioration of the situation in Somalia and have called on all parties to take a course of reconciliation as soon as possible in the dialogue on the future of the country so that a peaceful solution can be found to the current tragic situation.
Thus, the Danish ‘no’ vote offers prospects and opportunities for finally setting European cooperation on a course better suited to the wishes of European citizens.
However, if this Parliament strongly supports it, it would certainly be an important factor in persuading the Council of Ministers to take the course we believe to be the right one.
Even when these difficulties increased, which was undoubtedly the case during the course of our presidency until its end, we were aware that we were not allowed to abandon our course.
Not all Member States want to follow the same course.

The firm and consistent approach of Europeans was developed following lengthy discussions with Member States and industry during the course of the negotiations.
This shows, Madam President, that the current regime, supported by the military in the Grande, is taking a hard line against dissidents, for which we, all 12 Member States of the European Union, have a share of the responsibility, because there, although Parliament has sounded the alarm several times, not only human rights, but also basic democratic principles are being violated.
I fully support my colleague's line, according to which codecision with Parliament under Article 129d is necessary for both proposals.
The cumbersome tanker Europe with 12 captains - one thicker, the other narrower - is not progressing and it has no clear course.
Since the Council's deliberations have not yet been concluded, it is not in a position at this stage to comment on the course it intends to follow in this matter.
Now the President can follow the course he has taken and, I understand, lead his team in seeking a middle way.
I would just like to say briefly that this morning, at my suggestion, the Commission adopted an interesting communication on this subject, which, on the one hand, of course sticks to the budgetary line, but at the same time highlights a number of new opportunities which Europe should use.
Germany has spared no effort, nor has it spared any sacrifices, to achieve this objective, and you will understand, Mr President, that I have to pay tribute to Chancellor Kohl, who has maintained this course with courage and determination.
Therefore, although this report is addressed to all the European institutions, it is, above all, justified as an internal discussion paper by our Parliament, which is intended to set the most democratic course for our parliamentary route during 1999.

Positions at General Motors Overseas Corporation with responsibility for European sales, marketing, planning and trade relations.
PREPARATION: The concept of tariff preferences is based on the recognition that it is particularly difficult for countries whose industries are still being developed, i.e. developing countries, to gain a foothold on the markets of industrialised countries and increase their sales there.
Such a market structure entails internationalization, because national oligopolies with a stable internal market look elsewhere to increase their sales.
Price reductions in excess of agreed sales figures: In France automatic price reductions for products whose sales significantly exceed the sales figures indicated in the original price calculation.
Furthermore, uniform EC standards give the European car industry an important competitive advantage over lorries manufacturers outside the Community, since 57 states are now transposing EC standards into their national legislation, because they have realised that they are also useful and practicable for their countries; this promotes lorries sales and, at the same time, creates thousands of new jobs within the Community that we so desperately need, Mr Collins.
I think it is important to note that, in the European car industry, all the companies had achieved record sales years up to the beginning of 1980 and that the advance of Japanese competition had long been foreseen, including by the car industry in Europe, which perhaps believed in part that things were still going so well without needing to make an effort.
It will exacerbate intra-European competition, because even the Member States of the Community, which have so far tried to protect themselves restrictively from Japanese competition, will very soon find that European suppliers will seek their way onto the market of these countries in order to secure the sale of their cars despite the increased Japanese imports.
In view of the increase in milk supplies in the Community during 1982 and the corresponding increase in butter production, the Commission considers that two types of measures are needed in the short term, partly in order to ensure a reasonable sale of butter stocks, partly in order to prevent a further increase in the butter mountain.
As you know, the Community has fallen considerably behind in this area over the last ten years, as shown by its paragraph, which was already moderate at the time.
Both the Subcommittee on Technical Barriers to Trade and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs believe that the noise level of household appliances plays a role in sales and that this problem is solved by competition, by market forces themselves, so that there is no need for legislation.
The Community consumer organisations, like the Socialist Group, have been tirelessly pointing out for years that only a move away from sales and price guarantees and a move towards genuine structural policy can get the process back on track.
Such an action would have allowed this country to artificially expand its market in 1985, which would undoubtedly have exacerbated the already difficult situation in this market.
I am prepared to consider such an abolition at a time when a level of production is reached which is acceptable for internal use and for sales.
Can the Commission say to what extent the sale of unleaded petrol has replaced sales of leaded petrol in every single Member State of the Community?
We should therefore support anything that serves to increase quality and improve marketing and sales.
The European Parliament recently decided to promote not intervention measures in these products, but rather market-oriented sales by improving the quality of supply.
Contrary to the hopes of everyone, but also to Norway's expectations, sales on the Japanese market did not increase in 1995; indeed, there has been a slight decline.
On the other hand, by means of a prudent export policy, the Commission promotes the sale of Community travel on the internal market.
However, given the differing views of the Member States as regards the promotion of sales on the internal market and, in general, the positions of the Member States on the sale or promotion of the sale of alcoholic beverages, I believe that we have a problem here which would make it very difficult to include them in a common organisation of the market in wine.
This initiative is all the more correct because we already have assessments of the campaigns to promote the sale of olive oil and fibre, as Mr Fantuzzi also pointed out, whose sales in third countries have increased thanks to the promotion of ad hoc instruments.
In this context, I would like to stress that I welcome the desire for increased sales, which is mentioned in the Fantuzzi report.
The EU must pursue an active export policy which goes beyond the use of export refunds and which, in addition to the export refunds already in place, can have a positive effect on the sale of agricultural products.
In the Community, the sale of starch and its derivatives is supported by production subsidies when these products are used in industries which are not subject to import protection, such as the chemical, pharmaceutical and paper industries.
The concept of tariff preferences is based on the recognition that it is particularly difficult for those countries whose industries are still under construction, i.e. the developing countries, to increase their sales on the markets of the developed countries.
According to the Community, this system was at least partly the cause of the very sharp decline in Community motor vehicle exports to Greece recently, while the suppliers of certain third countries were able to maintain or even increase their sales.
- to facilitate the sale on the world market of quantities of agricultural products not covered by framework agreements.
(14) The impact on the Community industry concerned, in particular on those companies that produce a large proportion of non-marked standard goods, was mainly reflected in a decline in production, in sales and market losses, and in a significant fall in prices, combined with significant reductions in net revenues or rising losses.
- increased sales of raw materials from ACP countries in Eastern Europe;
The Commissioner, Mr CHEYSSCN, recalled that the Community alcohol market is clearly experiencing a decline, which naturally affects the sales of rum and other spirits in this market.
Its production and sales increased 2% from 1981 to 1984.

In recent years, natural gas sales have broken down as follows:
The paragraph was distributed as follows (estimated in 1984):
Sales to households in 1984, for their part, were distributed according to the following zones: kWh/year
In 1984, sales across the public network were distributed as follows (temporary results):
These associations, which are professional bodies subject to civil law, may, under the express condition, not distribute any profits (including any refunds) to their members, share or share agricultural machinery, as well as the collective supply of their members and the collective sale of their products.
Therefore, without neglecting the important aspect of the supply of raw materials, a greater focus on sales and market problems was urgently needed.
The increase in sales of motor vehicles in 1994 led to a slight recovery in production in the rubber industry, although production has still not reached the level of 1992 in terms of value.
The fact that large companies are weakened or even completely closed also contributes to the lively development of small businesses and their share of sales in France from 1980 to 1988 by 10%.
In the Community, sales of coal have decreased from 45 million tonnes to 40 million tonnes since 1990. The percentage declines in the individual countries were between 3% (UK) and 17% (Luxembourg).
In the EU, sales of coal decreased by 1.8 million tonnes (4.4%) from 39.7 million tonnes in 1992 to 37.9 million tonnes in 1993.
The beef shortage should have favoured the sale of poultry meat, whose prices are relatively low and attractive to the consumer.
A decision under Article 86 required the United Brands Company to abandon the following abusive practices in the marketing of Chiquita bananas within the common market: the closure of the market as a result of the ban on the resale of green bananas; the refusal to supply an importing Danish maturation; a differentiated sales policy whereby the Irish, German, Danish, Dutch and Belgian customers are charged inappropriately for four different prices.
The main measures introduced in 1972 for the sale of butter and skimmed milk powder surpluses have continued this year too; in particular, butter has been made cheaply to certain food industries and consumer groups.
However, the continuing poor economic situation in the second half of 1975 resulted in significant losses in the sales of coal and coke to thermal power plants and to the iron and steel industry.
The joint expert group set up following President Jenkins' visit to Tokyo in October 1977 will continue to examine in detail the conditions for access to the Japanese market for Community products in sectors where sales could be increased.
On the other hand, however, the paragraph should also be secured.
(i) either the commissions usually paid or agreed upon on sales in the Community or the usual surcharges for profits and general costs (including the direct and indirect costs of sales) for imported goods of the same genus or type;
The Community supports the financing of works that help to increase production, reduce rock prices or facilitate sales of products.
(i) either the commissions usually paid or agreed upon on sales in the Community or the usual surcharges for profits and general costs (including the direct and indirect costs of sales) for imported goods of the same genus or type;
Tunisia's sales of industrial products are heavily concentrated in clothing and, to a lesser extent, in spiders (1979, over 18% of all exports), partly due to the spectacular increase in the 'passive processing trade' that followed investment by companies from Community countries, particularly from the Federal Republic.
This could even lead, as is already the case with northern products, to the Community displacing established exporters through subsidised sales on the world market.
In particular, Morocco managed to redistribute its sales from France and the Federal Republic to the Benelux countries and Scandinavia, and in particular the USSR and Saudi Arabia.
This solution is likely to have the merit of entailing a less open Community obligation than guaranteed income or guaranteed/sales on the Community markets themselves.
Since, in most of these cases, employment has at least the same importance as the effects on the balance of payments, it would be a better way to guarantee sales of reduced quantities, but at higher (possibly intra-Community) prices than before.
The ban on minimum prices does not apply to the sale of books, newspapers and magazines or to goods and services subject to specific legislation enshrining minimum or fixed prices.
They are crucial framework conditions for regional production and employment.
In the case of mineral resources such as copper, phosphate, iron ore, the ACP countries receive project support when production and sales are at risk and export revenues are reduced as a result.
The overall concentration in the food production and processing sector is low in terms of sales.
Of course, this programme is not a patent recipe for European agriculture: in individual cases it can help to open up new opportunities for sales and income.
As long as the crisis persists, many on both sides are accused of protectionism; this accusation is levelled at lobbies that find obstacles to the sale of their products or fear that their market will be flooded with products that no longer go to the usual outlets.
The Dutch exports, which, to a considerable extent (1983, consist of almost 30%) of raw materials and pre-products whose sales are particularly sensitive to the economic situation, could be stimulated, in particular by the current storage system.
This would be a considerable increase in volumes, bearing in mind that the forecasts for sales on foreign markets reached 440 billion m3 in mid-1983.
In fact, it is likely that there will be little increase in demand for steel products, which is likely to result in a fairly slow increase in total exports, although sales of the new companies will develop dynamically.
While sales of natural gas abroad continued to decline relative to 1986, exports of finished goods grew relatively lively, despite the guild’s strong appreciation in 1986 and 1987.
With ministries retaining control over the supply of raw materials and prices, and guaranteeing sales, most management seemed more interested in maintaining a good relationship with the apparatus than in demanding their new entrepreneurial freedom.
Parliament must also be represented on the board of Europol and be able to participate in the election of the director of that body.
To an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese, police are seeking witnesses.
Because he was confronted by a car on his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to escape and touched the guideline.
On Thursday night, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum, with his VW, arrived at the B 215 from Stolzenau in the direction of Leese.
In the area around Stolzenau, he was confronted by a car on his lane, so he had to move to the right.
The Touran rider touched the guideline.
There was damage to property on the passenger car.
The driver of the nearby car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a lorry and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident.
It may be good, according to the accident victim, that the Mercedes driver had not even noticed the accident.
Police are now appealing for witnesses to the incident as well as the driver of the cause vehicle to contact the commissioner's office in Stolzenau on Tel 05761/92060.
The lack of storage and transport capacity and organisational difficulties mean that the slurry must be concentrated on agricultural land in a favourable location.
These bookshops place the publications of EUR-OP in a storefront or part of a storefront reserved for this purpose and must keep the most important publications of EUR-OP in stock; they must also be connected to an online ordering system for the procurement of non-disclosure titles.
The fall in domestic consumption due to economic crisis, the fall in the income of the workforce due to unemployment and high inflation and the fall in exports of Greek wines following accession to the EEC have led to the creation of significant stocks, for example in Crete, Santorini and other areas.
In addition to the 1981 harvest, 115 000 tonnes from the 1980s are still in stock which could not be removed.
Only one of the speakers mentioned the possibility that his own garden could become a storage place for radioactive waste.
We should be ashamed that we have huge amounts of milk and butter in stock, while children are dying of hunger in the Third World.
He can of course reject it at this stage, but that would only mean a postponement, because the day will surely come when the Council will have to reduce quotas and dismantle the camps.
However, the honourable Member's observation that 50 000 tonnes of last year's harvest is in stock is to be contradicted.
If we continue with our set-aside programme, we will soon have 18 million tonnes in stock.
The Commission claims that the stocks are too large, which is not true, because less than nine million tonnes of stock, not even 6% of annual production, is no exaggeration, but let us put that aside.
After intervention purchases, we have 200 000 tonnes of butter in stock, not to mention East German stocks, and by the end of this year these stocks will grow to around 270 000 tonnes.

The offers must be addressed to the intervention centres, which have good stock and resale facilities.
Now we are told that the camps are too expensive.
Most of my group supports the rapporteur's amendment that military installations or camps should fall within the scope of the directive.
The entire warehouse is divided into different rooms.
In principle, it should be possible for Germany, France or England to dump their radioactive waste in a warehouse in Sweden.
The concentration of production capacity enables maximum economies of scale and leads to the abandonment of intermediate production, storage and transhipment sites, resulting in conurbations in production and distribution areas.
Up to the point of individualisation, the number of bearings is kept as low as possible, which reduces storage risk, storage costs and throughput times.
Specific applications include: Businessmen who want to retrieve their fax and e-mail messages from outside locations and without special equipment, sellers who want to check without terminal whether a given product is in stock, and individuals who want to check their bank account by telephone.

This service takes care of removals, storage (including warehouses in Overijse) as well as insurance and inventory collection.
This could not be achieved, however, as the negotiating conference was unable to resolve the differences of opinion on certain fundamental issues (especially on the general scope of the camps, their division between the Member States, the details of developing countries' participation in storage and the price levels at which the camp intervenes through reception or levy).
The Council decided to increase the monthly increments for the 1981/82 marketing year by around 20% in order to take account of the development of storage and financing costs for cereal storage and the need to dispose of cereal stocks according to the needs of the market.
This increase, which applies to cereals, flour from wheat and rye, as well as to cereal and feedries from wheat, was granted within the framework of the objectives of the basic regulation on cereals and with regard to the storage and financing costs for cereals in the Community and the need to decommission stocks of cereals in a way that does not cause market disruption.
Data processing, office, procurement, general maintenance, maintenance of equipment, vehicle parks, drivers, warehouses and archives
The Council took this decision within the framework of the objective of the basic regulation 'Getreides' in order to take account of the costs of storage and financing for cereals in the Community and to allow a sale of cereal stocks which does not lead to market disruption.

While staff working in the local business need lower qualifications, those responsible for warehouse management and data technology need far higher education and training levels.
Changes in stocks can be identified either as a difference between the inventory at the end and the inventory at the beginning of the reporting year or as a difference between the inputs to the warehouse and the declines from the warehouse during the reporting year.
Port vessels, barges and tows used in seaports, ferries, fishing vessels, dredging vessels, hydraulic works vessels and ships used exclusively as warehouses, floating workshops, houseboats and recreational uses.
The rapid growth in final demand in some Member States during the quarter has led to a reduction in the French (-1.2% of GDP) holdings in the Netherlands (-1.0% of GDP), Denmark (-0.7% of GDP) and Sweden (-0.2% of GDP), with the latter three also shifting to an opposite trend compared to the previous quarter.
Sales of olive oil from Italian intervention stocks were repeated; at the end of 1978 around 95 000 tonnes were still in stock.

In particular, the General Court would like to know whether such a sale has taken place when the purchase contract has been concluded between two companies established outside the Community's customs area, but the Buyer, a subsidiary of the Seller, has a branch established in that area, which has the task of ordering the goods from the Seller, managing the warehouses and distributing the goods to customers, in particular to distributors for the products sold under the parent company's trademark.

Thus, high elasticity vis-à-vis the share of capital inflows in assets can correspond to a small adjustment of stocks.
Apart from losses caused by persistent storage, processing, and transport difficulties, supply will decline, because farmers, apparently expecting a further price increase following the increase in government purchasing prices in May 1990, are hoarding the grain.
Obviously, the stock of pre- and intermediate products partially dismantled in the spring will be filled up again.
The development prospects for production, for their part, remain positive, even if they deteriorate by one point (+5 compared to + 6) and thus reach their July level again, which is undoubtedly related to the slightly more unfavourable expectations regarding the size of the stock of unsold finished goods (+12 versus +11) (Table 2).

Halpern reduction in the pits will be substantial in 1985 (particularly in the UK), but almost fully offset by an increase in the stockpiles at UK power plants.
For example, at the end of August 1975, the nineteenth community held almost 1 mill, t (322,000 tons) in stock, with 960 000 tons (322,000 tons) at the end of August 1975, although production had fallen by 2.4% in 1974 compared to 1973, and the increase in the first months of 1975 (January to April) with 6.2% did not seem so spectacular.
In recent years, the shelf-life, storage and transport technology for milk products has been developed, disseminated and discounted to the extent that the supra-regional supply of all milk products is practicable today.
Certain requirements are met when all goods stored in a particular room are transferred to security ("space security contract") or when items to be transferred from the warehouse are individually marked ("marking contracts").
However, the market can also be supported by more flexible measures such as aid for storage or distillation, withdrawal by producer groups and so on.
Interview: 'Domspatz report exonerates Pope brother Georg Ratzinger'
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.
According to author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to spark debate.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the Reform movement "We are Church", said after publication to the German Press Agency that he expects an apology from the former Regensburg Bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Cathedral Chapel master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Benedict XVI.
It would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or their false assessment of what was happening at the time.
The Vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano, on the other hand, criticised the fact that when reporting on violence at the cathedral spies it was measured with "double standards."
Regarding the assaults in Regensburg, no one doubts that they are "disgraceful and shameful acts" that must be punished and prevented in the future; however, it is striking to note the "degree of media manipulation," according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of Italy's national bioethics committee.
"The habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and preparing public opinion to consider this to be normal," writes Scaraffia.
Also in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk, Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis said: "You like to go to the church and this is a found meal".
She also pointed out that in her youth, "slathering was a very normal educational tool" "to deal with cheeky children, like I was one."
They would find it unfair to apply today’s standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared in connection with reports of abuse.
Quite wrongly, according to the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memoir "My Brother of the Pope" (translated in 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all that had nothing to do with him," he assesses the results of the final report.
What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by lawyer Ulrich Weber, appointed by the diocese of Regensburg to investigate?
A total of 547 Regensburg Cathedral patties were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of assaults, 67 dompatches.
The final report says to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can therefore be said that in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence were used by Domkapellmeister R.
Particularly in the case of high emotionality, the punishment could be more severe for the students.
Nevertheless, unlike many other defendants, it is striking that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases, despite violence, even associate positive memories with him."
In the interview Hesemann explains why he believes the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger relieves the burden.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violent acts on guards at the Regensburger Domspatzens" gives a contradictory picture of cathedral master Georg Ratzinger.
For one thing, many students highlight his "humanity."
On the other hand, he also appears as a cholera and perfectionist, who often became tangible when a domicile musically failed to bring top performance.
How do you as his biographer view this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble and read the entire 440-page report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger actually appears in it.
He has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence at preschool also occurred outside its sphere of influence.
At best, he can be accused of learning about it too late or of not taking initial suggestions seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium on which it worked was perceived by virtually all respondents as - literally - "redemption", "sky" and "better world".
For example, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger gives an excellent testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted," "liked," "sincere," "competent" and "understandable," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candies and was "always surrounded by grapes of children."
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and high emotionality, which has sometimes led to riots.
He confessed years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for the fact that he not only punched with chairs and threw the keybone on the floor, but also distributed and drew overly cheeky guys on his hair or ears.
To his salvation of honour, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question, the 1960s and 1970s, both in parents and in teachers.
Do you know any more of these addictive methods?
Of course, I think every one of us born before 1968.
I too have experienced this in a secular school, a state grammar school.
Compared to what this report is really about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at pre-school, these are, of course, bagatelles.
One wonders whether it is not more to do with his notoriety and his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just rushed to him.
Many of those who never understood him are still working diligently on the Bavarian Pope.
The truth, though, is that the report exonerates Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
Much has been reported in the media in connection with the report on the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
Will Georg Ratzinger be accused of any involvement or complicity in sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have been entrusted to the cathedral bandmaster.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," one concerned deputy said to the others, "It was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem with investigating sexual abuse was, and is, that most victims remain silent out of shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, it would certainly not be a choral conductor who, after all, would have been a colleague of the perpetrators at work.
How do the domicile students assess Ratzinger's role in the abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: As one student in question put it: "With regard to sexual abuse ... I do not see ... a case in which it is precisely he (Georg Ratzinger) could have had timely findings and stopped the perpetrator.
I also find it really absurd to assume that it is exactly him ... Jacks have opened up more forcefully or more clearly, or even more so, than their parents, boarding schools, trust teachers, etc.
That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable."
The report therefore comes to the very clear conclusion: 'The fact that pupils and/or their environments were entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation'.
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free from any complicity.
Nor can he be accused of not preventing it or of being advertised.
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these repugnant crimes, as has unfortunately happened in some cases.
Much has been read in the media of "violent excess" at the Regensburg Cathedral pat-downs.
Former cathedral master Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report of "walking."
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: After all, this is the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, right in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that, in turn, is an abuse of the report.
After all, there is a neat separation: between the pre-school and the grammar school of the domicile, between sexual abuse and excesses of violence and, let us say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the conductor of the Cathedral patties.
The whole dreadful pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were literally harassed and tortured and suffered appallingly, all occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions had to prevail.
But cathedral master Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only got to face the boys when they were already on the Cathedral Patzengymnasium.
On that, as the vast majority of witnesses stress, the subject of "preschool" was taboo.
One was only happy to have escaped her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What was different on the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R., and therefore in many cases even positive memories are associated with him despite violence."
At most, this leaves the accusation of looking the other way.
But despite all the efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported the conditions at preschool.
The first time in 1970/71, when he was just starting to establish himself, he did not want to hear anything about what was going on at a school at which he did not act and was responsible (so the witness) and then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently lock his ears before the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because back in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Cathedral Patzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it, he points this out "that caning continues in preschool."
Even in view of the risk of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when there was legal clarity, when caning penalties were already banned in Bavaria.
Before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as we all know.
It was also difficult for him to assess where the people concerned were perhaps exaggerated or dramatised and where the permitted limit had really been exceeded.
Nor can we say that he has always looked the other way.
That is simply not true.
It was only in 1980 that caning in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria as well.
Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians talk about the "fall trick of anachronism", that is, the danger of judging the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess is right.
But this does not, of course, apply to sexual abuse, which has been abhorrent at all times, nor to what was reported in preschool of repugnance and violence to innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond what was common then.
That's all quite horrible and I'm glad it's finally being worked out.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all that had nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishing, so slapping and pulling on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When corporal punishment was then banned, he also adhered strictly to it.
What image of his Regensburger period did Georg Ratzinger give in conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Was the issue of caning also raised?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, telling from his perspective, as the domiciles played only a supporting role.
Nevertheless, I do not conceal the fact that he was leading a strict regiment there.
But this, too, must be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding absolute discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world-class institution from the hitherto more nationally known Regensburger Domspatzens, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and candies alone, you don't make big singers out of recalcitrant kneecaps and stand before every success, no matter what field, but always discipline, passion and self-absorption.
As what kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger in conversations about her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced him again and again as a wonderful, humorous, gracious, deeply believed and heartfelt person, from whom one cannot imagine that he could do anything even on a fly.
I regularly get to know how many former cathedral patrons still have contact with him today, 23 years after his emeritus, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.
So those who have not forgiven him for once being strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Today most domiciles are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music to them.
And that he was always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also an adorable person of respect to whom they still look up today and who they almost worship.
And I would like to make it quite clear once again that all they are accused of is educational methods, which were the order of the day at the time.
We can be pleased that we have long since overcome this period.
But it is highly unjust to make a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother, a media scapegoat.
The evil intention behind this is all too obvious.
Because the report just released relieves it.
Now the decency would dictate that a 93-year-old man who has earned a great deal of credit and, without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany, probably no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen would finally be left in peace.
Despite all the difficulties and the lack of resources in carrying out these operations, I am pleased to say that last year we have also succeeded in significantly reducing the commitment of the United Nations in Tajikistan and the Central African Republic.
