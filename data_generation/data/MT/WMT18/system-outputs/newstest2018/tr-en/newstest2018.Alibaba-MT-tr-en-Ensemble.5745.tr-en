Last minute: Our Cosmic visitor giant Asteroit 2014 JO25
There are perhaps billions more giant skyscrapers in the solar system, which can cause serious consequences when they collide.
They can have indoor or outdoor orbits left by the formation of the Sun "and can sometimes pass through the world.
The 650-metre-wide asteroit 2014 JO25 is such a visitor and will pass and travel 1.75 million km, the closest location to the world today at 14:24 p.m.
Over the course of the day, we have become more frequently heard about this style of news.
The main reason is developments in surveillance techniques and surveillance tools.
We also have the ability to determine smaller-scale asteroids, which cannot be determined earlier.
Last January, for example, a bus-sized asteroid passed through the Earth and just half of the moon distance (£250,000) and left.
And even more interesting asteroid was able to be determined just days before the switch.
So there may be other cosmic buses coming to us right now.
Imagine what you would do if you got the news that a 20-metre-wide asteroid would fall into the middle of the neighbourhood where you are?
In fact, asteroids of this size will not destroy our neighbourhood, but probably the windows of all buildings will explode.
This will be because of the shock waves spreading from the asteroid that will blow up in the atmosphere.
asteroit, for example, which fell to Russia in the 2013 "s, was in these dimensions and was enough to break the windows of buildings in a few cities.
However, if you are a neighbourhood in the target of a 100-metre-wide asteroid, it is at least 50km beyond the neighbourhood that advises you.
Criteria such as the size of the asteroid and the collision angle are factors that determine the depth of the krater and the damage to the collision.
Let's look at a few scenarios according to the simulation of "the European Space Agency."
If an asteroid of 100m turns to Earth at a speed of 60km per second with a 45-degree deficit, a krater with a depth of about 250m and a range of 1,200 m.
The collision is equivalent to an earthquake measuring 6 on the Richter scale, and even if you are 10km from the point of collision, there are 3 degrees of Burns in your body.
Those 50km away will be waiting for the broken windows.
If an asteroid turns over 1 km, it becomes even more intrinsic.
Such an asteroid, with the same angle and speed value, would take the Earth about 600m deep and a 12km wide krater.
So the husband would turn a district into a kingdom and instantly disappear.
Even if you are 100km away from the collision point due to the collision heat, there are 3 degrees of Burns in your body.
The collision is equivalent to an earthquake measuring 8 on the Richter scale.
The damage to the asteroid depends not only on the chemical composition of the asteroid, but also on the rocky structure of the area where it will collide.
The values above were given in reference to the scenario in which a hard-rock-like asteroid would fall into an area made up of tortoise rocks.
If the asteroid is mostly made up of iron, if it falls into a place with a surface formed by the cooling of lavatories, the krater size will increase 3 times, and the catastrophe associated with it will multiply.
66 million years ago, something more concrete came to the head of the dinosaurs and they were exposed to the catastrophe caused by the collision of an asteroid about 10km wide.
Because of the asteroid collision, 75% of the sea and land debris "instantly disappeared.
If such a large asteroid, which destroys dinosaurs, had targeted the Earth, sure, the most robust option would be to leave the planet.
Tonnes of substances fall into the world every day from space.
Most of them burn and ash in the atmosphere.
Some skyscrapers, which are big enough, burn in the atmosphere, causing what is commonly known as Star slides.
Let's finish our summer with another news that will bring internal relief.
Studies show that a huge asteroid is not expected to hit the Earth for the next 300-400 years, which will cause very serious destruction.
As gentlemen who live an average of 70 years, I'm sure you are somewhat relieved.

Phrase for Medel: 10m euros!
Gary Medel, who is certain to leave the Internet on the agenda of black-clad people who want to reinforce the stopper area...
The 30-year-old footballer, who is on vacation after wearing a format at the Confederations Cup in Chile and recently restarted work with the Internet, is waiting for offers to come to him.
Gazzetta dello Sport, a prestigious newspaper for Italians, said Beşiktaş had made a 10 million euro offer for the Internet, both for stoper, and for Medel, which can serve in the pre-libero region.
Black-clad, who submitted his offer to Medell, said he was waiting for a response from either side, while the Chilean footballer was keen to live with his family in İstanbul.
Despite Gazzetta's claim, the FFP limit, Kara Eagle, is unlikely to pay a price of as much as 10 million euros for Medel.
There is a possibility that the Blackhawks will first turn to Medell by leasing, as was the case with the transfer of Caner Erkin, or add the star player to the roster if there is a serious discount on his bonus.

Human rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which will travel to Missouri, issued a warning over the province's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The Missouri County NAACP travel advice statement, valid from August 28, 2017, gives special attention to the fact that African-American travellers, visitors and Missourians have recently been skeptical, race-based incidents are happening across the province, and are very cautious when traveling to the end of the province, as stated there," the group's statement said.
The NAACP said a new Missouri law makes it difficult for people to win discrimination cases, while at the same time targeting minorities disproportionately by the province's legal practices has been a factor in the group issuing this travel warning.
"There are human rights violations that happen to people.
They are stopped, beaten and killed because of the color of their magazines, "said Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri NAACP, to the Kansan City star.
"We hear complaints at the rate we haven't heard before," he said.
It is the first time the Association has issued such a warning for a province in the United States.
The group cited racist insults against black students at the University of Missouri and the deaths of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders was taken into custody earlier this year without being charged with a crime by Missouri police after his fuel passed through the province and died under suspicious circumstances.
The recommendation statement also points to a new report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office, which shows that black drivers in the province are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than whites.
"The advice statement is for people to be vigilant and to warn their family, friends and colleagues that they might be in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People should be ready, whether it's to bring bail money with them, to report to their relatives that they will pass through this province," he said.
In Missouri, 100 hate crimes were committed in 2015, according to the latest figures in the FBI's hate crimes reporting program; this puts the province 16th in the country in terms of the number of similar violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that makes it harder for a business to sue for discrimination when renting housing or doing business.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel advice for Texas and Arizona after the local executive authorities of those counties passed immigration enforcement laws that ordered people to be arrested for immigration violations; the ACLU says it would increase enforcement by race.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently advocacy groups have resorted to the practice in response to a number of laws and trends inside the United States.
Demba Ba Ba tamam in Besiktas
Demba Ba Ba, who transferred to Chinese team Shanghai Shenhua for 13m euros two seasons ago and was rated black - bearded between last season's circuit, is returning to Beşiktaş "free of charge.

Referendum exit from Barzani!
Barzani gave a speech at a memorial service in the city of Duhok marking the 3rd anniversary of the terrorist group DEAŞ attacking the Ezids in Mosul's Sincar district.
In his speech, Barzani referred to the independence referendum, which ikbyn wants to hold on 25 September, saying: "I regret this, we have no hope that Iraq will be a right and proper country."
We tried all the ways with Iraq, but we were completely desperate and desperate.
Our past experience with Iraq has brought us to this situation and there is no guarantee that we can take our rights and be protected.
So it is necessary for all of us to show the world that we can secure our destiny through a referendum so that co-existence and security are assured.
I should underline that; the referendum is not a purpose for us but a means for us to achieve the bigger goal.
Recalling that after 2003, when the Baas regime fell, the Iraqi central government made a lot of promises to the Kurds, Barzani said that the disaster in Sincar had happened soon, and that the decision to hold a direct referendum was made after fighting DEAŞ.
Barzani, who has expressed a desire for peaceful and democratic destiny for the self-protection and development of IKBY's People, said: "It has emerged with documents that Iraq is unable or unwilling to protect us like a state."
He defended his view that "he doesn't want us to move forward."
Barzani said the Iraqi central government did not give them weapons during the fight against the terrorist group DEAŞ, but reacted briefly to the fact that the Hashdi Shaabi, formed with a fetva, was quickly legalized and all weapons were secured.
Inside Iraq's defense system, the Peshmerge was unaccounted for.
The central government did not make it to Peshmerge, which it submitted to Hashdi Shaabi.
Peshmerge is considered part of Iraq's defense system according to the constitution.
However, Hashdi Shaabi did not have a constitutional presence, while in violation of the laws, all possibilities were mobilised.
We are not saying we are against Hashdi Shaabi.
Peshmerge and Hashdi Shaabi fought on the same front, why, on the one hand, the Hashdi Shaabi legalization, the presence of the peshmerga and the fight against terrorism.
This is our deep wounds with Baghdad.
The terrorist group DEAŞ carried out an attack on Ezids living in Mosul's Sincar district on August 3, 2014, killing several people, including women and children.

Trump's White House now takes aim at Freedom statue
The most precise sign of regime change is that they are starting to attack statues.
Americans know as much as any of this; qualified, essentially, the toppling of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003...
Stephen Miller, one of the key founders of the Trump regime, knew exactly what CNN's Jim Acosta and the speaker were doing while symbolically destroying the Statue of Liberty in a heated debate over their offer to sharply restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he had done so, a host of boat tour owners and freedom takers would have lynched him.
But he attacked his manor, and especially his manor, which was attributed to him in 1903, 17 years after the memorial itself was completed, after Emma Lazarus's famous poem was added to the memorial floor.
As he made his way to Acosta, Miller said: "I don't want to talk about the end of history here, but the Statue of Liberty... is the symbol of American freedom in light of the world.
The poem you mentioned was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Freedom. "
Miller is actually right, but as he says himself, this is not really about history.
This is about the modern repercussion of Lazarus's daunting words, not only that a state in them invites not only some elderly immigrants but also the poor: "Tired, poor, / blocked masses are reluctant to take a breath of freedom, and / the cliched snow is not desirable."
There has never been a time when the "persona non grata" is so visible on our screens.
Miller wasn't a critic; he was explaining that these people are not welcome in Trump's United States.
The clash over the manor of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is actually a clash over the manor of America.
Lazarus and his friends, who campaigned to put his words on the base of the statue after his death, knew very well that they were engaged in quite a political act.
The statue was intended to celebrate the links between French and American republicanism with a stereotype, representing Liberty's arrival in the body as a woman.
Lazarus changed the landscape: in his poem, the female figurehead was no longer abstract, he had a voice.
And it gives him a very different name: the mother of the exiled.
The poem's marriage with images is a vicious feminist coup and a devastating attack on American anti-immigrant.
And, as the same Lazarus changed the landscape of the statue, right-handers had long wanted to change it back.
Grand palavrist Rush Limbaugh, a Baptist John-style man for Trump's arrival, argued in 2010 that freedom did not invite anyone inside, but rather was an early - circuit neocon that kept American fire in the Dark: "Female freedom is coming.
He is there to carry the torch of freedom from the United States of America to the rest of the world.
It's not as if the torch is lighting the road to the United States of America, "he said.
Unusually, Limbaugh actually discovered something.
The mantle of the statue was all about perception.
Lazarus's magnificent creative act was to see this as if it were to be seen after long and often awful journeys by people who were exhausted, curious but hopeful in the doorsteps of the ships.
It was really about seeing the world from the perspective of people who are looking for a place to shelter and want to improve their lives.
His statue was responding to them with words of hope and the warm welcome they needed to hear.
Of course, this is not a perspective that Miller and Trump will find justified in any way.
Their torch is not to show cause, but to diminish hatred, which is their only source of power.

World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of Great Britain team
Eilidh Doyle recalls the time when only two Scots were able to enter the Great Britain team
United Kingdom athletic performance director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish group on the world championship roster will make a "huge contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which begins on Friday.
Black believes that "something is developing" in Scotland and that United Kingdom athletics should learn from it.
"We embrace it, and we're trying to understand it, and we're going to deal with it until we get out of it," Black said.
"I speak to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it's about what they do.
Scottish Athletics think this is about what they are doing.
British athletics: he thinks it's about what they do.
So is the man on the street in the corner.
Regardless of the combination of circumstances, this is certainly great. "
Many Scottish athletes, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah in the 5000 m, are competing for medals, while Eilidh Doyle has been chosen as captain by the cast.
"Eilidh is a bit of a low-key volunteer.
The captaincy speech was unbelievable, "Black said.
"Regardless of whether they are Scottish or where they live or train, a few athletes were very proud and really motivated from that room.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally added was amazing. "
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at his fifth World Championships, says it is "incredible" that 16 Scottish are on the UK team.
Scotland's best total athlete figure at previous world championships was seven, which was achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Muir leader, a middle distance runner who broke five Britons and two European records last year.
Join the 1500m and 5000 m.
Chris O'Hare, who ran in the 1500 m, is another Scottish who has had a very good season, including England team try-outs and victories in the year - turning games.
Doyle recalls his first championship, when the only other Scottish on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says he is "very proud" of the move because many of his nurses will not just enter the team but in some cases will compete for medals and struggle to qualify for the finals.
"The special aspect of being team captain is that it happened with votes from other members of the team, so it was already a huge honor but it made it extra special for me to know that your team-mates voted for you and chose you," he added.
"Obviously, I'm proud of all the Scotts that have come into the team.
It shows how far we've come.
And they are here, as self-proven athletes, as athletes who make it to the podium.
As for the captain's speech?
Yes, I think it went well.
I took advantage of the fact that we are very lucky in this situation, in this sense, we have a world championship that is at home.
So, the fact that we are successful only with the impact of being able to capitalise on this infield support and the fact that we have returned to the Olympic Stadium.
I've got a second chance to go out there and fight and it's going to be such a great atmosphere there, "he said.
Blocking critics on Facebook: running for state office if voters can't afford criticism
The father of our country had some information about negative coverage in the press.
Americans segregated George Washington, but it didn't take too long for newspapers to start criticizing him heavily about everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Of course, he was disturbed by the criticism.
But he did not silence his critics.
Because, in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be eliminated, and we can be foolishly and quietly dragged into the shore."
It brings me to Larry Hogan, the governor of Maryland, who needs to work harder to be like Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and erased the sharing of at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff did not care about the case on the grounds that it was unserious, and online comments were filled with reactions, "who cares?"
"It's just Facebook," many said.
But this is important.
When you have someone like Hogan, that is particularly important.
It is a Republican governor who is astonishingly popular in a province that is overwhelmingly Democratic.
It has the second-highest tasvip rate among the country's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary crazy fan.
He has shown mastery in leading his province and in strict adherence to principles.
He was also highly skilled in using Facebook as a primary tool to connect with his constituents, with his post-chemotherapy hairless head in a joke.
So it is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to block people from coming to the governor's page, which is a public forum, officially described as being run by staff members who are paid tax dollars by the public.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Amelia Chasse, Hogan's women's spokeswoman, defended the governor's actions, claiming that blocking the comments was nothing more than regulating them.
But it's very easy to use images of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people making verbal salutes online.
The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are real people who speak only to their elected leaders: a teacher, a workaholic and a monarch; not a trol.
All said their comments were not respectful, thoughtful and poignant.
In his sharing, he addressed Hogan's Catholic faith and made an excerpt from the Bible.
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, a lawyer from Maryland Bowie, was not hate-filled but asked about hate crimes.
"I sincerely regret his comment that I am disappointed that he remains unresponsive to hate crimes and other recent news reports," he wrote in the commentary section of the post.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people comment on the same issue, some of them just ignore it as a collective effort to dictate rather than a large group of anxious citizens," he said.
Others would probably call the governor's staff an "intensified spam attack."
The Facebook era makes it easier for a message to be readily available through the blocking of an opponent or the erasing of a negative message.
It is much clearer than in the old days, when staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers where there were critical writings, or to arrest and silence protesters.
But that's exactly what happened, even if it was digital.
Hogan is not the first public servant to be criticised for neutralizing Facebook and other social media.
Chairman Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked in the flow of Twitter.
One of the decisions that could be referred to in the future on this issue came from Virginia last week.
The presidency of the Loudoun administrative district board of supervisors was in violation of the first constitutional amendment when it banned a voter on Facebook, according to James C. Cacheris, a US district judge in Alexandria.
In Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (Republican) was visited by the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
At the time of Washington, the affordable mail takeover had a fairly similar effect on the Internet.
Between 1775 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and unknown letter writers overcame his leadership.
Even then, Washington had unknown trolls.
People who used nicknames such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers that shook Washington's decisions.
According to the online George Washington articles project, which collects historical documents, he had bungled the office of petitions criticising his stance on the Treaty of Friendship, trade and navigation with the UK.
But he didn't silence them.
Freedom of expression, dissent and acquiescence are at the very foundation of our nation.
Real leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes he will be at the comfort of his home at the Renaissance Club
Ronan Rafferty, a former European number one, hopes that in the next three days, he will be at the comfort of his home when he hosts the 25th edition of the Renaissance Club, Scottish Senior Open in South Lothian.
The Northern Irish, who made the final by leading the next door before losing to Paul Eales in Archerfield lineup, feel committed to the new venue and act as the tournament's envoy on behalf of Townsend's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched the Renaissance Club build up and see it get its glory along with this organization," Rafferty said.
The players will see the field in its best form, in a terrific situation.
Jerry set up this place and did a terrific job.
He is an undaunted advocate of this game and proud of his success here.
That's a great show for this field. ""
Britain's Eales will struggle to maintain a title for the first time in his 32-year career, despite winning both the Europen Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"It felt really special," said the Southport-based player.
"I never had a chance to keep the Extremadura Open because it was removed from the calendar the following year when I won.
It's very nice to go back to that part of the world.
It's a great place to play Golf.
Memories from last year are alive, and for me and my wife Sharon, it was very interesting to win last year.
It was a time when we would remember the passing with special and always love, "he said.
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 at the start of this year, is also making a return to the game in his own field.
It will be the first Scotland event since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little bit more when you're struggling inside," Helensburgh man Orr said.
"You want to do well but you also feel the extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played essentially golf.
I'm happy with how it's gone so far. ""
Joining the three on the field are former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and Senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among 6 Scots on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

I found the answer
Imagine a "seat"... with a budget of 6 billion 867 million Turkish Lira, more than the budget for each of the eleven ministries, including the economy, development, energy and natural resources, science industry and technology, environment and urbanism, health, culture and tourism ministries!
Staff numbers 117,378.
Turkey's biggest "propaganda base!"
Yes, I'm talking about the Presidency of Religious Affairs!
Yes, I will talk about Mehmet Görmez, head of religious affairs!
For days... I've been looking for an answer to the question in my head...
I wonder the real reason Mehmet Görmez was removed from his post...
I read every article about his departure.
I don't.
I can't find the answer to the question I'm looking for.
Just at the beginning of the year...
Mehmet Görmez has drafted the strategic plan for the Presidency of Religious Affairs (DDB) 2017-2021.
1 million lira S 600 model Mercedes were pulled under President Erdoğan.
I mean, he didn't have a problem with Erdoğan.
What happened?
"Seven years in office is not enough," you might say.
The first U.S. president, M. Rıfat Börekçi, served 17 years.
Mehmet Nuri Yılmaz, all you know, sat in that seat for 11 years.
So... the president's mandate is clear.
I'm back in charge again: why did Mehmet Görmez leave his post?
Business is down...
Shiite proximity
The source close to the Power said: "According to the traditional ultrasound, Mehmet cymez did not have the ehli Sunnet!"
The code of this sentence is this: it did not have Sunnis!
The man who shouted this phrase was left behind: "modernist by traditional ulema!"
So, Mehmet Görmez was seen as innovative.
What was innovation?
The answer was kept by Mehmet Görmez on a trip abroad.
History: 27 December 2015.
Mehmet Görmez traveled to İran to take part in the 29th wahdet conference in Tehran - which aims to bring Islamic sects closer together.
He spoke with Ayetullah Ali Hamaney, İran's religious leader.
Praying with Shiite clerics.
And he said at the conference: "Sectarian shrines that have formed over time represent different ideas and convictions in the understanding of İslam."
The aim of it all is to determine the direction up to God.
Each is a secondary road leading to the main road, but where they will arrive is the same.
It is never acceptable to associate sectarianism with religion, or to view sectarian origin as above Islamic atheism.
Secrecy-based degradation, kissing and conflict are reflections of taassubun and ignorance.
It was the religion itself that suffered the most in the way that sectarian religion prevailed...
Here, I want to highlight it again:
Poetry and Sunnis are one hope...
"No one can bother someone else about whether or not he perceives İslam as he understands it"...
A year later...
Only Jamaican leader Selahattin Özgündüz of Turkey attended the 30th wahdet meeting.
So...
Vehhabism, not Sunnis
Mehmet Görmez's trip to İran and his speech at the conference made him the target of "traditional ultrasound."
It was bundane that no one -- again -- represented the Turkish state at the next Tehran Conference.
Already Mehmet Görmez has not received an invitation four times since taking office.
The reason was clear; the Shiite - Iranian anti - ISIS "traditional ulema!"
From the beginning of 2016, on the heels of his trip to İran, Mehmet Görmez's seat was set to be dismantled.
At the beginning of this, he was in charge of the DBB-the then - Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş!
Mehmet Görmez drowned so much that he asked "Let the DB be tied to the Presidency."
In essence...
There was a difference in the state from the point of view of Sunnis.
Some "traditional ulema," whose theological worlds were created in Saudi Arabia and Egyptian meddles, summed up Sunnis with Vehhabi - Salafism in the shadow of the United States!
They were Iranian dissidents, who were not even Taiwanese on a trip to Tehran.
His remarks about Mehmet Görmez were not surprising: "There was no danger to the Diyanet from this."
"Rabbim," a stunning reis nasip eyebrow attached to the homeland and loyal to the ehlisen...
They used "ehlissy" as a symbol of Iranian enmity.
At one point the FETÖ --CIA-backed anti - İran -- was now running new names.
And with FETÖ gambling...
A photograph of a teenager with a visual in his hand was served to the media with the denial of "Mehmet Görmez's son!"
Ah what a coincidence!
Who made the biggest opposition to Mehmet Görmez in the media: the US-led activist community's newspaper, Turkey!
In the end...
- Resistance to Sunnis not to bring Saudi Vehhabi to its predecessor line...
- Not fuelling sectarian secession...
- Modernist... a cleric whose consciousness was destroyed by the "traditional ulema" created during the cold war...
US cultural imperialism continues to make Turkey rapidly Arabic (Vehhabi - Salafist).
You have no doubts that the future head of religious affairs will be a Vehhabi - Salafist representative!

Fairness and death in Indonesia's gold
Bardina Degei cooks and doesn't use January.
He rarely even uses a pot.
In Papua, Indonesia's restive region, a wooden house in Enarotali, in Paniai naiped, puts a sweet potato, usually known locally as "nota," directly on fire.
Half an hour later, the buttered yumru is taken and swept away with appetite, the hands unwashed.
Degei sits on the ground in the mud, where he makes angarian work, such as washing washes with cloudy water from nearby Swansea, he has no furniture.
A kova in the roofless house serves as a sahra hell.
As the youngest of her husband's four wife, she was never given a job in any field.
Chocolate is routine here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed and most drink a lot, and then there are the soldiers.
"No one walks in the village after 5 pm," he said.
A rare view of daily life in the mountainous regions of Papua, a former Dutch colony absorbed by Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum in which only 1,026 elderly people were forced to vote by force as umumi before they invaded.
An existing movement that propagates independence against Dutch rule has quickly turned its ire to the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region, banning foreign journalists or rights surveillance organizations.
In 2003, the area was officially designated as Papua and West Papua, where independent Papua New Guinea would occupy the eastern part of the island.
The Enarotali is as remote as it is distant; the journey there involves a 90-minute flight from the regional capital, Jayapura, to nabirea, and a 5-hour drive through the Mideast with a rental vehicle.
There is no public transport.
The 19,000 - acre resort contains wooden houses surrounded by bambu fences, burned iron roofs poured into various garlic Brown tongues.
Few Indonesians have traveled there, let alone journalists, and virtually no foreigners have traveled there.
Before the Hristiyan missionaries arrived, Mee Pago taped Papuans to a god called Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," Degei says, alluding to his lively colored, elegant yellow, sheep burgers and bright foot.
"Previously, we would only wear leaves on our body," he said.
Papua, Indonesia's poorest region, where 28% of people live below the poor border, has the worst cholera death and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's Golden Boot.
Grasberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoRan, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a mountainous region in the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport extracted $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper from it.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion in timber reserves.
But these riches, a source of misery for Papuans, ensure that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
The New York Times's 2005 research reports that Freeport paid local military personnel and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including sums of up to $150,000 given to a single officer.
Papuans call for more autonomy threatens this golden egg-eating chicken, and mercilessly comes from their rights.
More than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by the Indonesian army since 1969, according to rights activists, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
Mass killings in mountainous parts of Papua in the 1970s reached genocide figures according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peaceful demonstrators in the region last year alone.
The Brisbane archdiocese's 2016 "we will lose everything" report includes testimonies of sectarianism committed in the previous year, including unlawful executions, torture (according to another report, rape and electricity) and the brutal crushing of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to calculate the number of victims because there are incidents every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Pressure has been heightened because Papua's resources have brought settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
The region's population of 3.5 million is 83% hrs, but demographics are changing as Muslim migrants from Indonesia's crowded islands Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi arrive for economic purposes.
Java's warung buffs sell gado - gado, which is served with sprouted chicken and vegetables - mixing ground - flavored sausage.
Locals have a hard time competing.
"Immigrants sell chickens and Vegetables cheaper in traditional markets than in local Papuans," explains Abeth You, 24, a native of Paniai who has moved to the regional capital, Jayapura, for work.
"It caused local Papuans, the Papuan mama - ma'am (women) to lose market," he said.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, better known as Jokowi, vowed during his 2014 election campaign to address inequalities and rights abuses in Papua.
The former marquee was on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta, where he received the votes of 27 of Papua's 29 regions, including Panaia.
But little has changed in Papua, and today locals feel deceived.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 in the expectation that he will carry out our hope that justice will be restored," he said.
In fact, Paniai experienced its worst situation just two months after Jokowi took office in October.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children sang Christmas carols in front of a festive fire in Enarotali, while two Indonesian soldiers on motorcycles crashed and crossed the road.
Frightened children told them they should open their mouths.
One of the soldiers infiltrated their base and, according to local Pope Yavedt tebai, later returned with four soldiers.
Victims and eyewitnesses said the soldiers, who had received alcohol, chased the group and beat them with their rifles.
Then one of the soldiers fired at the group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby government Election Commission building was set on fire and events escalated the following day.
Up to 1,000 Papuan men, women and children gathered to demand justice at a football field outside the local police station and military command center.
They were carrying ceremonial hunting pedestrians and performed the waita dance of Papua's Mee Pago tribe (by running to the people and imitating the bird).
Some protesters began throwing stones at police and military garrison.
As the nerves escalated further, orders were sent to the soldiers via interlocutor radio: "If the crowd resisted more than three times, shoot them and kill them," an official paperwork seen by TIME said, without being disclosed to local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), the head of the Kego Koto neighbourhood in Enarotali, saw the imminent danger and demanded calm by burning to the crowd to return home.
No one had any intention of listening.
"When I turned my arse, I was shot from my left bracket," he told TIME at the presentation of the brightly colored wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired the shots, but says the bullet came from collected military meltdown
"It was the crowd, it was shot many times," he adds.
Local Alfius Youw was shot three times, according to his cousin, who was involved in the attacks.
Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, is known only by one name, said, "I ran into him and examined his body to make sure it was him."
"I saw him die... I kissed him," he said.
Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers had only "secured" the station because the station was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said branch director Pudjo Sulistiyo, a spokesman for Papua Police, in 2015.
"It's a matter of death thickness."
Five young protesters were killed and many were injured, according to Human Rights Watch.
News of the deaths reached Jakarta only the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a euphoric speech in Jayapura, saying he shared the pain of the victims' families and vowing to solve the historic abuses in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it doesn't happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, security minister Wiranto said he had established a non-criminal mechanism for historical human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most of the negatives were a long time ago.
Some are in their 90s and some are in their early 2000s.
The issue is that we are determined to address these violations but there are processes we need to go through, "he said.
Speaking to TIME on June 5th, Wiranto backtracked, saying he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "they will all be solved by the law."
B. M. 's Wiranto, where East Timor has been accused of "crimes against humanity" linked to more than 1,000 deaths during the bloody 1999 independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, including the Paniai incident, had already been resolved.
The families of the Paniai victims greeted such claims with bitter scepticism.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years but there hasn't been any progress," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
Years later, she said, she was still living in fear.
"I'm afraid," she said.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the soldier, I'm afraid of being shot," he said.
His brother, Yacobus, echoes the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
After helping to bury four of the victims, he says he was beaten by the soldier.
"After burying the bodies, the soldier came to look for me," she said.
The attacks have not stopped yet.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired on villagers in Paniai's neighbor, Deiyai naiped.
One person was killed and 17 others, including children, were injured during a clash between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help a man who was not himself taken to hospital.
Ravianus Douw, 24, who drowned in a nearby lake while fishing, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the company's construction site office.
Police said villagers threw stones at officers, who responded by firing a warning shot.
But locals say the moving Brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) opened fire on the crowd and killed someone.
"We were very panicked, we were afraid that revenge would be taken," Dominggu Badii, 29, who lives close to the hospital and said the injured had been raised.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
Deiyai's parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for the moving police brigade to withdraw from the area.
Paniai has always been a troubled area for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the people of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal kabile, who live sporadically along Papua's Green Mountain Center.
Many have joined the rebellious army Free Papua Movement (OPM), which claims to protect the rights of Papuans by carrying out random attacks and carrying out kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some senior OPM leaders, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya, are from Paniai.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and held arbitrarily in recent years by soldiers under the guise of "protecting national sovereignty."
Some never see it again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as a "tragic and forgotten place."
Fairness feeds dissatisfaction.
The little rice on sale in Enarotali is too expensive for locals to buy.
Bread is out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat: basically noodles, as well as some fruits and leaves.
Farming is the work of women who can idolise sweet potatoes with four or five fields.
They usually store most of the harvest for the family; they sell the rest on the local market.
10 note only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).
Over time, economic disparities between local Papuans and new migrants have grown since the opening of new air routes to Nabire Airport.
Already few jobs usually go to immigrants who are better educated and richer.
Papuans rarely have the capitalization or the necessary qualifications to conduct their own affairs as competitive.
"Young people have no interest in staying in the village because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, president of the Panai kabile Council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
Other than that, the limits of reporting for the international media are tight.
Earlier this year, French journalist Franck escu and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua for "a lack of co-ordination with relevant institutions," despite permission to draw videos given to them as rare.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's election campaign promises to lift limits on reporting and development to increase transparency have not been met.
In a statement, he said: "There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to make news from Indonesia's restive eastern villas, Papua and West Papua: visa rejection and blacklist."
The lack of press oversight means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is often limited to its neighbours in the immediate vicinity of Papua.
In March, six Pacific nations (Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands) encouraged the B.M. Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including Panaia attacks.
The same countries have historically supported OPM.
"In Indonesia, the democratic system is still valid and there is free media so it is difficult to cover up the evidence in human rights cases," Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir told reporters in Jakarta, but did not care about the group's claims.
Locals want more foreign governments to be interested.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by Kees Van Baar, the country's human rights envoy, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence by saying, "we want freedom," according to a source who attended the meeting and did not want to be named.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say it is unlikely they will vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai attack," says Gobai, president of the Kabile Council.
Jokowi wants the people of Paniai to know that, apart from living under the imminent threat of the zorba soldier, he has been rounded up inside fakru zaruret with his wallet education and health services.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, see their vote as a "debt" to repay to Jokowi.
"They don't need the money, they just want justice," she said.
Despite the threats and scaremongering, the families of the victims of the Paniai attack carried out a final symbolic counter - act: burying a victim's body on land just across the police and soldiers station.
Knowing that justice may never be done, they will at least ensure that those responsible do not forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus said, his head straight away.
"What else can we do?"

Fire engulfs Dubai's'Me shale 'skyscraper for second time
A fire in Dubai on Friday ravaged the world's highest residential towers and forced hundreds of residents to flee the 79-story structure, which is 337 metres long.
This is the second major fire to spread rapidly into the high building, which is called the Torch Tower, in two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and there was no explanation for the cause of the large fire.
"We were asleep and we woke up to the fire alert, people were screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes for us to reach from the 50th floor, "a calm who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defense authorities said the firefighting team extinguished the large fire around 4 am local time (00:00 GMT) and were cooling off the building.
The government said it was trying to provide shelter for those affected.
This incident could reopen questions about the safety of the material used in external parts of high buildings worldwide.
An investigation by the torch management into the aftermath of the fire in 2015 found that most of the damage was in the external panels used in the capsule, namely for decomposition and isolation.
Police in the United Kingdom said they believe the isolation and captivity panel system on London's Grenfell Tower, where 80 people died, may have contributed to the rapid spread of the June fire there.

'Benefits for more than 4,000 chronic patients
4,300 tuberculosis and SSPE patients will benefit from the benefit programme, which will be launched for poor residents and their families struggling with chronic diseases by the Ministry of Family and Social Policies.
The charity plans to provide patients with monthly support above two-thirds of the minimum wage, and will also provide regular psychosocial support.
According to the information obtained, the details and implementation of the "New Social Assistance Programme for families struggling with chronic diseases", which began work some time ago under the direction of Family and Social Policies Minister Fatma Betül Kaya.
The benefits programme, which was launched to support citizens with economic and psychological difficulties who are struggling with chronic diseases in a labor union with the Ministry of Health, is also the first in the world in many ways.
Having completed all the necessary preparations for the launch of the programme, the ministry will also provide regular psychosocial support to families with the benefit programme, not just transplants.
It is thus aimed at poor citizens who have chronic illness and continue their treatment processes at home, and their families not to be left alone, both financially and morally.
According to studies, the first stage will provide regular psychosocial and transplant support to poor citizens struggling with Subakut Sklerozan Panensefalit (SSPE), a brain disease caused by tuberculosis and angry microcephaly.
Later in the programme, poor citizens struggling with other rare and risky diseases will be covered by the aid programme.
In addition to the planned support of more than two-thirds of the minimum wage, additional payments can be made to tuberculosis patients identified by the relevant health unit, where they are unable to handle their medical self-care, continue their life as dependent on bed, or the necessity for improving household living conditions.
The requirement that the monthly income per capita in the household be less than two-thirds of the minimum wage's monthly net worth is sought in order to benefit from the support.
In addition, citizens who suffer from SSPE should be found to have a health board report, which is regulated according to the code of conduct and essentials set out in the "measure of altruism, classification and regulation of health board reports for apprenticeships."
More than 1 in 5 US passengers bring banned substances on board, survey finds
According to the survey of airline passengers, more than 20% knowingly or unknowingly smuggled banned substances on board from US Transportation Security Agency checkpoints, including at least 6% carrying banned knives or other sharp objects.
Less than 1% later claimed to have noticed that they had mistakenly traveled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
Research conducted by Stratos Jet Charters, the Jet leasing service, with more than 1,000 people, also found that younger passengers were more prone to breaking the rules.
Among the participants who admitted to knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7% were of Y generation, but fewer than 15 were members of X generation.
The most general substances that are knowingly smuggled in from TSA agents are food and liquids.
More than 3% admitted knowingly taking sharp tools from safety, while 2.2% of female participants and 3.7% of male participants also admitted to knowingly carrying banned drugs on board.
The firm said it was surveying passengers nationwide to find out how many people from airport security mistakenly brought smuggled goods and how many did so knowingly.
Knowingly or unknowingly, it is no surprise that the most likely people to pass on smuggled goods from security are the ones who fly the most.
Still, as the firm points out, the TSA rules are a piece of cliché and confusing.
People are often unsure about what liquids or how much they can carry from them.
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of substances seized by the TSA have emerged as banned liquids.
For a while, people thought that the TSA might be treating the books as smuggled goods.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international ones.
China welcomes US statements

Chinese foreign minister Vang said Tillerson re-emphasized the principles of the Washington administration on the North Korean issue, saying they hoped the United States would implement these principles effectively and in a concrete results - oriented policy.
Noting that the security of the Korean peninsula is their priority, Vang stressed that they expect the sides to find the middle way in which they can resolve their concerns through equal dialogue, while Beijing's leadership has been adamant since the end of the peninsula that the peninsula should be free of conflict, maintaining peace and stability, resolving problems through dialogue and negotiation.
EPA President Pruitt scrambles to delay Obama - era emissions reduction laws
A day after being sued by 15 counties, the head of the Environmental Protection Organization, Scott Pruitt, reversed an earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama - era laws that reduced air polluting emissions that caused pis smoke.
Pruitt represented change when his own organization was more sensitive to the needs of provincial environmental regulators than past administrations.
He never mentioned the issue of a legal challenge against his previous position in a federal Supreme Court.
What is at stake is that the provinces are starting to meet the October 1 deadline of 2015 standards for ground level ozone.
Pruitt had announced that he would delay compliance by a year in June to give his own organization more time to work out the plan and avoid "interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's provincial attorney general before his appointment by President Donald Trump, had long served as a reliable ally against stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has moved several times to block or delay regulations that are opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden change is Pruitt's latest legal defeat for his agenda to regain regulation.
Last month, a federal Supreme Court in Washington ruled that the EPA executive's attempt to delay the practice, which demands that oil and gas companies oversee and reduce methane leaks, an Obama Administration Law, exceeded the limits of his authority.
In a statement released Wednesday evening, Pruitt said the reversal in ozone standards reinforced the EPA's commitment to working with counties only in time for the new standards and through complex processes.
Pruitt, who has sued the EPA on more than a dozen occasions in his previous job, said: "Under previous administrations, the EPA frequently fails to meet the deadlines of decisions, waits to be sued by activist groups and others, and is happy to settle the dispute to arrange timelines for the decision."
"We do not believe in regulation by suing, and we take the histories of the term seriously.
We would also take seriously the law and the authority it gives us. "
Still, the EPA's statement said Pruitt could use his "delaying authority and all other legally available authority" at some point to ensure that regulations are "supported by sound policies and the best available information."
Republicans in Congress are pressing for a broader rewrite of the ozone laws.
A parliamentary bill approved last month strives to delay implementation of the 2015 laws by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been brought to the Senate for a vote.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of counties that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to keep up the legal pressure.
Schneiderman said: "The EPA's change of judgment after our trials is a significant gain for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans affected by pis smoke that flows into their communities."
The lawsuit involved New York from California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and District of Columbia.
Ground-level ozone is created when General pollutants are salvaged by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical facilities and other sources that respond to sunlight in the atmosphere.
Emerging pis smoke can cause serious breathing problems in a group of quickly affected people and contributes to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists applauded Pruitt's surprise decision change.
Lori Ann Burd, of the Centre for biodiversity, said: "It is disturbing that so much pressure is needed to achieve this common sense step from the person tasked with protecting the air we breathe."
"We must continue to fight against the ideological struggle of the Trump administration to lift the environment to pollutants and interest groups."
Inflation is single digits
Turkey, which saw its biggest rise in exports in 6 years in July, saw unemployment fall from 13% in January to 10.5% in April, and its economic confidence index rose to a peak of 3.5 years, bringing inflation to single digits.
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.15% in July, while annual inflation fell to single digits for the first time since January, at 9.79%, according to data released yesterday by the Turkish Statistical Office (CIC).

The highest year-on-year increase was in the transport group at 15.24%.
Noting that inflation fell to single digits in July, in line with expectations, "the moderate audience in inflation has the effect of falling prices for food and clothing groups."
However, there is a rise in core indicators compared to the previous month, as opposed to the headline.
"We do not expect a loosening of the central bank's tight standing," he said.
Headline inflation has declined but core inflation indicators have risen.
Of the special comprehensive CPI indicators closely watched by the central bank, the B index rose from 9.07% to 9.46% in July, and the C index rose from 9.20% to 9.60%.
Inflation could close the year from 9.3%, said Enver Erkan, deputy director of research at Kapital FX, adding that "inflation could fluctuate by December and fall to single digits in December."

We predict that annual inflation will fall further downwards.

According to leaked phone conversation notes, Trump pressed Mexico over its border wall payment.
Notes of phone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia were leaked by the Washington Post.
In a phone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on January 27th, Trump squeezed him over his failure to publicly say he would not pay for the proposed border wall.

Patient relatives break doctor's nose
Doctors and employees of Turkey's high İhtisas Training and Research Hospital walked off the job briefly yesterday morning in response to the daring of a doctor's friends by patient relatives.
Crowds gathered outside the main entrance to the hospital carrying banners reading "No to violence in good health" and reacting to the incident.
Prof. Dr. Feyza Ayşenur Paç, the hospital's head of children's cardiology clinical, said: "The slogan" No to violence in health "seems to me to be an inadequate even side slogan."
In Health, violence cannot be a place of words.
"If it goes this way," he said, "these people will soon be unable to find a health gurubu to serve themselves."
The health workers' action was supported by Ankara City Health Director Dr. Kamil Türkmen, general secretary of Ankara first regional public hospitals, Dr. Öner Odabash, head of Turkey's high İhtisas Education and Research Hospital, and relatives of patients at the hospital yard.
Condemning the incident, he said:
Unfortunately, violence against health workers is increasing.
One example of this phenomenon was found yesterday (the previous day) in the evening, when our cardiovascular surgical medicine was narrowed down by a patient.
We demand an increase in the vulnerability of our people to this, even though we have taken the measures we have as our state, ministry and governor to ensure these events are finished as soon as possible.
I condemn yesterday's events on behalf of my hospital and health workers.
Noting the need for community awareness of violence in health, Odabash said, "Unfortunately this has become a professional complication that we are experiencing from time to time."
"We will take our own measures but the most important thing is that our nation has its own health worker," he said.
The legal process for the incident has begun, Türkmen said, adding, "Our laws on violence in health have been effective enough."
The ranks of the state enforce it.
At the moment, the police are working.
In the past, they were always in vain, but now there is a direct public case, and the state is hiring lawyers, pursuing the case.
"There are also examples of severe punishment taken for this," he said.
After the revelations, the employees resumed their work.
The alleged incident occurred at around 17.45 pm the previous day.
Relatives of the patient, who died in intensive care, attacked Dr Hamdi Mehmet Özbek, who worked in the Cardiovascular Surgery department, who reported the death.
He was evacuated from the scene by doctors and assistants; police were called to the hospital.
Özbek's nose was broken during the incident, while the attackers were taken into custody.
A witness to the incident said:
When our friend went to the patient's relatives to report the condition of a patient who died, the patient relatives blamed our friend and US for the situation and attacked our two friends.
Our friend's nose was broken, he was in the blood.
Then we took our friend inside the amalgamation and hid him.
For 15-20 minutes, we pulled a security set.
If patient relatives had crossed that security wall, much worse things would have happened.
Heavy blow to DEAŞ in Gaziantep: 102 chuval...

YPG looting in Syria...
US intervened
According to local sources quoted by AA, YPG terrorists looted the homes of residents of the resort town of Tel Semin in Rakhine's northern countryside, where US military support has entered on the grounds of fighting the terrorist group DEAŞ.
The response of civilians whose homes were looted and seized has turned into a clash with the terrorist group.
On top of that, US forces in the area entered the resort with armored vehicles.
"Cougar MRAP" type armored vehicles, personnel carriers and Husky - type mine - setting vehicles were found to constitute a buffer zone in the resort.

Let's not let the old world fight tomorrow
The deleterious perception of home and world realities can lead to crises, not just of pure people.
One of the reasons why the backward East, which we describe as "charming," is perceived as delaying world realities, may be that the reflection of these realities on the geographies of the East is prevented by certain focuses or announced in a fact-based way.
Don personot and Oblomov have been the subject of the literary world by delaying facts and change, or not being perceived at all.
Cervantes's "Don personot" is a meczuptur who still considers himself a knighthood in the reverse, when bourgeois began to form.
Or Goncharov's "Oblomov" is a lazy heir who thinks that when he ignores the facts, everything can go on as before.
For example, China was a country that was open to the world and dominated by the seas until the end of the 15th century, with a passionate dynasty closing in on the throne.
That's until the execution of the captives of the boats that ran out of Chinese land water.
We Turks, whose one leg, eye and ear are in the West, and the other leg, eye and ear East, have had constant dilemmas about perception of reality and change, starting in Ottoman.
We have tried to bring our old and new world to the present, to understand the present with concepts that fit the old conditions, to think of the world tomorrow.
If we have a section, we have also been able to act as fast as think-tanks in developed countries when it comes to perception of home and world realities as well as change.
This has been the source of constant clashes, tensions.
With Medrese, the university, the modern army with newcomers, suspicion with faith, a dramatic intrinsic duality.
Even worse, the progressivity was also not accepted that the new and advanced hearings, at some point, would be old at the end of certain periods and would be left behind.
After a while, yesterday's progressives began to declare the new and progressive "dangerous," while trying to interpret dormant and world conditions in line with up-to-date reality.
The most important lesson was that in Ottoman, by delaying the realities of dormitories and the world, the Empire eventually fell apart, collapsed and the people were impoverished.
The most important lesson of our Ottoman past to the Republic was the fact that the world cycle and the rapid perception of change was an inevitable prerequisite for survival.
Because this lesson was very well summed up, we were able to be the exemplary country of this geography, capable of maintaining its unity, integrity, stability in peace from World War I until now.
For us to be able to right and salim the process of global change, which is taking a different approach, we need to put the crushes behind us and act in line with the facts.
In other words, there will be no one to blame for the meaningless camouflage and bloodletting that has been the cause of our democracy in the past.
And in today's world, the smallest mistakes lead to huge and dramatic crises.
The most problematic geography is the Middle East we are in.

Turkey winds down
Relying on Turkey's future, global giants struggled to break ground in yesterday's wind plant auction.
A world record was set in the tender, which was held by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources to ensure the transition to national energy by reducing outside dependence.
The auction, which will bring down Turkey's energy costs, also paved the way for $1 billion in investment and close to 4,000 jobs.
By early 2019, domestic production wind turbines will be incorporated into the system.
8 consortium, including US, Chinese, German and Danish giants, participated in the licensing tender for the renewable resource areas (YEKA) wind plant, which was opened by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources.
Financial offer envelopes were first opened to determine the 5 bidders who made the lowest bid.
After initial bidding envelopes, the lowest bid was $4.19 / kWh.
The Open - Brexit range was set at 0.01%.
After the tender began, joint venture groups including Enercon, Gold Wind, GE, Senvion and Vestas decided not to participate in the auction.
Groups including Siemens, Nordex and Mingyang competed in the open Brexit.
After the consortium with Nordex also pulled out, MingYang - first construction and Siemens - Turkmens - Kalyon remained in the final two.
MingYang - the first construction took a break 11 times.
The Siemens - Turkmen - Kalyon Energy consortium has never used a break.
Energy and Natural Resources Minister Berat Albayrak: record day for Turkey.
30 rounds of open Brexit.
The winner of the intense feud between the two consortium was the Siemens - Turkers - Kalyon joint venture group, which made the lowest bid at $3.48 cents / kWh.
The consortium made a $3.49 cents / kWh offer in the tender, while at the request of the tender commission headed by Assistant Secretary Alparslan Bayraktar, it withdrew its offer to $3.48.
With the result in the two-hour YEKA auction, Turkey achieved a world record.
$3.48 / cent per kWh offered in bidding has gone down in history as the lowest in the world.
The previous record was for Mexico at $3.84 / cent per kWh.
Energy and Natural Resources Minister Berat Albayrak, who held a press conference after the tender was concluded, said the winning of the competition by German company Siemens was an important message to the region and the world, adding, "if we also look at the 200 years of historical cooperation of Turkey and Germany, I think this outcome will make an important contribution to Turkish-German relations."
Our goals are great.
What has emerged today is how robust and confident the economy and energy market are moving into the future.
No matter how many regional crises there are in the world, I was very proud to reveal with this tender that Turkey is at the helm of the region and the most reliable investment countries in the world.
"In this painting, which we will be proud of as 80 million, the biggest contributor is our president, whose 15 years of rule and leadership have taken Turkey to this point," he said.
Albayrak, who said they had begun a new era with the auction, which was open, transparent and fierce competition, said: "One of the most important steps in this is the cost of buying $10.3 / cent per kWh with domestic contributions up to Earth, with a historical record of $3.48 / Centre."
I am proud of it, on behalf of my nation, on behalf of my country.
Minister Albayrak said they aim to activate the first domestic production panels in solar energy before the end of 2018, adding, "by early 2019, we will incorporate our domestic production wind turbines into the system."
The turbines will be set up in 5 designated regions.
The winner of the competition will be required to install a wind force of at least 50 megawatts in each of these 5 regions, with a total installed force of 1,000 megawatts.
The total investment in the Siemens - Turkmen - Kalyon Group will be more than $1 billion.
The minimum 3 billion kWh of electric power will be generated each year as domestic wind plants enter the business, and the annual electricity needs of about 1.1 million homes will be met by wind.
An average of 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 / year emissions reduction will also have been achieved thanks to future wind installations.
The winning bidder will plant more than $100 million in investments.
The plant will produce an average of 300 to 450 domestic wind turbines, with at least 2.3 megawatts of power.
The consortium will conduct 10 years of R & D work in a total of 5 areas in at least three of the areas of canvas, generator design, materials technologies and production techniques, software and innovative teeth box.
Each year, $5 million will be allocated for R & D work, with 50 technical staff, 80% of whom are domestic engineers.
The factory will be set up 21 months after the contract is signed.
The licence period for the project is 30 years.
Kazım Türker, chairman of the board of directors of Turkmen construction, which is part of the consortium that won the tender, said domestic production will be around 64 percent in the project, 35 percent of the equipment will come from abroad, adding, "we plan to finance the equipment from foreign sources and the rest from domestic banks."
Türker said the auction reflected confidence in the Turkish economy.
Murtaza Ata, head of the Kalyon Holding Energy Group, said: "It was a tender to reduce Turkey's dependence on outsiders by another thousand megawatts."
"We are happy with the result," he said.
SIemens Gamesa Turkey senior manager Hakan Yıldırım said they had been operating in Turkey for 160 years, adding, "we will do our best to lower the cost of the electricity unit further."
The localization rate for wind turbines to be produced at the plant will be a minimum of 65%.
Of the 8,000 industrial pieces found in the wind turbine, 65% will be domestic (at least 5,200 pieces).
At least 50 MW will be installed in each of the 5 regions and a total of 1,000 MW will be installed.
3.750 employment opportunities for 10-year R & D, $5 m each year for R & D activities
The 1,000 MW wind facility produces between 300 and 450 domestic wind turbines with a 65% placement rate of at least 2.3 MWe.
Investment of more than $1 billion, 400 MW / year wind turbine production capacity of over $100 million.
Electricity production to meet the needs of about 1.1 million homes is a minimum of 3 billion kWh of electric power each year, an average of 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 / year emissions reduction.

The middle-aged fine - line team took a long breath from the leader of the gang, a man inside the elbow, and carefully looked at the inside from the front.
Inside, the occupants were irked by fear.
"We want a z..... Roger!" the man tweeted.
"Interest from the car is him!"
A young black man was driving from the front passenger seat, while screams were breaking the darkness.
Fortunately, this appalling scene on 22 June is just a re-enactment.
But when an illuminator was thrown around the neck of "Roger," almost everyone in the audience gave quite realistically a respite.
Since 2005, human rights activists have been returning to Ford Bridge in Moore to revive the lynching of two black couples (Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey) by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
So far, no one has been charged with the murders.
Tyrone Brooks, who helped organise the re-enactment, said: "Even though we see them in our communities, it doesn't mind that not a single person has been arrested for all these years, even though we know who they are."
"It's a stain on history but a burden on our souls."
At 71, Brooks was a former Georgia county congressman and a lifelong human rights advocate.
For him, this revival is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
He said: "We want prosecution, we want results, we want wounds to heal, we want reconciliation, but we have to get justice first."
"We cannot have the wounds healed and reconciliation until we achieve justice."
On 27 July 1946, the criminal battalion put a shell on the body of one of the victims of Ford Lincoln in Moore.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding areas were suspected of lynching.
But even one has never been investigated.
Although the suspects remain on the run for decades, human rights activists say the twin motivations of the lynchings are always well known throughout the town: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling made it possible for black citizens in Georgia to vote in the primary at the end of that summer.
In virtually the same time as the election, black partner Roger Malcom stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, apparently over a woman during a fight, according to the FBI.
Brooks said his gossip in the town was that Hester was lying with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby he was carrying was not from her husband.
On 25 July 1946, Loy Harrison, a leading white landowner, paid $600 to get Malcom out of jail, according to the FBI.
Dorothy and her cousins, Mae Murray, and George Dorsey Reed, went to prison.
But when they arrived at Ford Bridge in Moore, as they walked away from the prison with the vehicle, a lynching gang surrounded the car.
"It is understood that it was Harrison who arranged and ordered the killings," an FBI report concludes.
"Also, obviously there was a secret agreement between the provincial and local college forces that they not only took part in the murder, destroyed evidence and concealed the identities of eyewitnesses."
Brooks explained shorter and self-explanatory.
He said: "It was a right - to - vote massacre."
"All of them were killed to send a message to the black people in this community: 'I'm going to register and if you vote, this is what's going to happen to you. '"
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has been leading the revival of Ford Bridge liners in Moore, which takes place every year.
His performance is based on all the details, attention and a deep kind of racism that many believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and even harder to turn their eye, but Greene says that's the goal.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because that's what makes our tube face the ugliness in our drinks," he said.
"But I can't develop a relationship with you if they don't listen to me or listen to what's going on in my head," he said.
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, close to 30 actors (a dozen white and the rest black) filled a room and listened when Greene reluctantly entered the game's well-rehearsed general lines.
Wade Marbaugh is an associate director of Greene.
Over the years, Chairman Klansman has played his role, but says the role has never been easier.
Marbaugh said: "I feel contaminated because it's not me."
"But I think it's very important to keep this past alive because we don't want to go back to those times," he said.
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who played Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester throughout the room, were rehearsing their own selfies.
The game starts when Malcom shouted and pushed him to Hester, where he was very angry because he was lying with his wife Dorothy.
"Z.... i said," Wow, from my property! "
Rascona reacts.
There is a shooting voice.
And then everyone (at least black actors) drove to kahkaesha.
Greene laughs the most.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He was terrified, he was surprised.
I've got a lot?
"No," Greene chuckled inside.
"I just don't think white people were saying z... I was," he said.
"Yes," one of the black players said, throwing stones mixed with a joke.
"You have to push'r."
So the energy in the room is changing, and some form of sincerity is replacing discontent.
Everyone is dedicated to doing it right, not only for the hatred of the game, but also for the memory of the four people who were killed.
The stage is starting again.
This time, he says the word, starting with Rascona N, sharp and stressed.
Absolutely no one laughs.
The re-enactment ends fiercely and quickly.
There are screams, gunfire and then silence.
A woman dressed in funky black stands on the body of actors and reads "Strange Fruit," Billie Holiday's fascinating method.
In both words, his voice is broken.
One hundred yard behind, on average, a group of four dozen spectators shed their eyes and tears.
The viewer is almost equally divided in black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many from the road ahead.
Brooks took them on the holy journey to the cemeteries of Malcoms and Dorseys, all based on the oppressive notion of Georgians for almost eight hours.
Until this point, homicides had remained an anecdote, but now standing in the same place where Lincolnshire is, it's as if the mood was curious.
As the final ratings of the song weaken, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and examine the body.
Children are dumped on their hands, fake blood and unmoving bedfellows, and ruffled feathers on each other.
"They didn't actually die," a little boy reminded her.
A few minutes later, Greene thanks the crowd and finishes one.
Actors take the lead in lynching and wipe out tears.
Bradshaw is yelling at team elbow Marbaugh, who plays chairman Klansman.
Nick Rascona is yelling at two of his fellow players, and with tears in their arm, the emotional cost of the performance comes to him at the very end.
"No problem," one of the women whispered.
'We know that's not what's at the heart of you.
Do it for some reason. "
Later, viewers sit down for dinner with actors.
The white couple, who are from Atlanta at a table, have a heated conversation with a black couple about revival.
Denise Duplinski is finding it hard to find words about how the performance made her feel.
"To hear these terrible, awful words and that behaviour... they come out of people who look like you and they do it because they look like you," he said.
"What this has done to me is make the linemen think it is still going on," he added, "they are now just trying police gun attacks."
At the end of the room, Tyrone eats at the Brooks table and draws attention when describing memories of human rights.
He said he had already started planning for next year's performance.
"The re-enactment is somewhat inspirational because it tarnishes what we have joined but it is also instructive," he said.
"It's like," if you don't learn from this, it could happen again.
Those who do not study their own past, those who do not know their own past, are doomed to repeat it. "

Text 2 again to death!
Hakan "death is suicide, according to initial findings in a preliminary autopsy report by the Forensic Institution.
A thorough review found no trace of darp and cebir in the child's body.
The reason for the suicide is that the elastic bandage he painted is breathless.
bezin, whom his family referred to as the yellow bee, was also determined to be the elastic bandage used in the injuries.
After a detailed report on the boy's death was prepared, it was learned that the incident was a suicide, according to the newspaper Habertürk, which said the report would be sent to the "Public Prosecutor's Office", which is handling the investigation.
Police are investigating the child's suicide in full detail, while examinations are under way on his computer, which was seized after the incident.
Police will also seek the testimony of Hakan "friends.
Information from Hakan's computer, which his relatives call "cleared," can also be accessed to third people or a gang.
Police are assessing Hakan "may have been driving a gang to suicide.
The certainty that Hakan committed suicide turned the spotlight on the violent "Metin2."
Reacting on the grounds that it causes addiction and violence in children, Metin2, which was banned last year by the Antalya governor's office for those younger than 15, came up with the murder of "Minic hacker" Metin Kang, also 13, in 2009.
To play the 2005 "te Korea - designed Metin2," it is necessary to enter its site and register members.
The players are trying to make peace and justice in the world with the dragon god in the game.
In doing so, there are wars, the dose of violence is increasing.
The play also features images of war with cutting-edge, crazy weapons such as swords, pala, balta, as well as images of people being torn apart by wild animals and defeated by their meat.
He buys characters with money to strengthen.
The family, who buried their children the next day after the July 25 incident at the house in the Esenyurt İstiklal neighbourhood of Kunming Street, continued to claim murder.
"The whole dream was to become a doctor, we don't think it could hurt him or anyone else because of the game," Father Mehmet Ekinci said, adding, "They shook the elastic yellow to the neck and threw a wedge to the side."
He was found that way, my son.
We certainly don't think our son could have committed suicide if he could have harmed himself and someone else because of an online game.
We had news that he was playing like that.
It was not a game he played cheerfully.
Let's say he left the game a little bit as soon as he got bored.
Anne gullizar Ekinci said, "there is no-go inside the building."
At a certain time my child is said to have entered the house.
None of them hold each other.
When he came home the tree was the only seat.
"But when he had his funeral, he had 2 seats next to the computer," she said.
İlker Karash: may have been gang-raped
In general, families don't pay attention to this issue.
They look like "My child is at home, no matter what happens."
The boy communicates with a lot of people through the games.
There may have been a borrowing situation there, or a flip-flopping.
Or invited someone in the game to the house, which may have been a problem with them.
He may have been left with an impact because of his problems with other people, not because of the direct game but because of the way he communicated through the game.
The child may have thought of the visuality of the game, its fiction.
The trauma that drives suicide may be related to blackmail.
There is also the situation of being dragged into the bunker because if the child was faced with the situation of being insured the family would not be able to solve the problem.
He cannot have committed suicide because of the game itself.
There is also the possibility that the child may have been gang-raped.
He may have been gang-raped.
Individually, there can be nothing the child could have done alone.
It systems consultant Füsun Nemes: families should know their children's interaction
We can't say the games are harmful.
And research says the games are useful for children's development.
The important thing is that parents pay attention to what their children play and how they talk to players online.
Families should know and measure how children are affected by what content.
There are only 2 children in Turkey in 5 years who are said to have died because of the game.
This shows that ending a child's life is not just the impact of games.
What was there that pushed this child into this?
We have to learn that first.
Just look at the sociology and psychology around the child.
8-month yield in Borsa İstanbul based on 50 per cent
The BIST 100 index continued its upward trend in July, when it began in December 2016, and moved its rise to the 8th month in a row.
So the index rose for the first time in 8 months in a row since July 2007, with a 45.3% appreciation over the period.
The BIST 100 index, which has lagged the world's major stock markets, including Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, with its performance since the start of the year, did not leave leadership on a yield basis in July.
The Dow Jones Index in the United States, up 2.54%, followed by the FTSE 100 Index in the United Kingdom, which rose 7.06% in July.
The DAX index in Almaya and the Nikkei index in Japan ended July with a depreciation.
As of January - July, the BIST 100 index was found to have performed higher than both major world stock markets and emerging country stock indexes.
The BIST 100 index, which rose 37.6% from its 2016 close this year, was followed by the Dow Jones Index with a 10.76% rise, the DAX Index with a 5.55% gain, the Nikkei Index with a 4.55% rise and the FTSE 100 Index with a 3.21% rise.
The MSCI EM index, an indicator for emerging country stock markets, yielded 23%.
The historical process of the BIST 100 index has shown similar performances in the past.
The BIST 100 index, which last finished 8 months in a row between December 2006 and July 2007, Rose 38.3% over the period.
In addition, the BIST 100 index completed the 8 months between August 1996 and March 1997, with an appreciation of 9 months in a row between May 1997 and January 1998.
Eren Can, director of investment research at Meksa, told the AA reporter that the BIST 100 index had continued to rise for 8 months, noting that the rise had exceeded the 37% level since the start of the year.
The MSCI Emerging Markets (EM) index has risen 23%, the Fed said, noting that even when we look at these rates, there is positive separation.
The flow of funds to developing countries has continued since the beginning of the year.
In particular, funds in search of higher yields prefer higher yields.
As a result, domestic markets are being hit in a positive direction.
Of course, the appetite for risk-taking on a global scale is also high.
In doing so, stock indexes with risky asset status are undervalued.
In the US, the S & P 500 Index has risen by close to 11% since the start of the year, and we see new record levels being tested almost every week.
At the start of the year, the US central bank's (Fed) estimate of 3 interest rate hikes put markets under stress but eliminated uncertainty by using the Federal Reserve's oral guidance policy quite well, the Fed said, noting that there was an unsuspecting market for a rate increase.
Inflation in the United States is not yet at the desired level, the Fed said, and expectations that the Fed will not rush to raise rates and avoid radical moves have also been quite a factor in current pricing.
US President Donald Trump's failure to cancel health care reform, known as "Obamacare," reinforces the perception that he will not be able to deliver on his expansionary finance policies commitments, he said, adding that "the faster Trump - led US economy expectations positively affect stock markets over a period of time, the faster growth and the faster the response to inflation will be in this context."
In terms of Turkish markets, the Fed noted that 2016 was a year of a lot of negativity, and said it was in an effort to close the gap according to the likes of the BIST 100 index, which is negative and oversold.
Knowing that they have not seen a strong recovery with the flow of domestic news, the Fed said the current outlook could be interpreted primarily as triggering an increase in appetite for risk-taking abroad and a desire to close the gap according to the likes of home markets.
The FTSE 100 Index, which technically tests new records at 108,600 levels, said it was monitoring some snow sales.
The 109,500 - 110,000 area in particular is a critical threshold in the short term.
After approaching these levels, it is normal for snow sales to occur.
In the short term, we think a new local or global story should be created for the price of 110,000 grapes.
For now, a downward spiral of 107,500 support could trigger profit sales.
I think that relaxation can be seen in the 106,000 - 105,500 area, even though we are tracking 107,000 intermediate support.
Breaking the 105,500 support in particular could bring withdrawals up to 104,300, a level that bodes well for the Fibo 50% of the rise from 100,000 to 108,600.
The decisions of both the Fed and the European Central Bank (ECB) will be at the heart of the global market, the Fed said, noting that expectations for the Federal Reserve are already clear, but the possibility that the balance sheet reduction programme could trigger a strengthening in the US dollar, even though a rate increase is not expected at the September FOMC.
The Fed said this could trigger profit sales in the emerging country (GOÜ) stock indexes, which are overshadowed by oversupply in the short term, adding, "what is also important is what the ECB will say."
After the July monetary policy board meeting, ECB President Mario Draghi had indicated that they would discuss the course of monetary policy in the autumn, a rhetoric that helped push the euro / dollar parity above 1.1700 levels.
So statements on whether the $60 billion monthly asset purchase programme will be reduced or terminated will mean that post-Fed liquidity on a global scale will also be reduced by the ECB.
"Therefore, negative pricing on behalf of the country's markets, such as Turkey, which has a high current account deficit and compulsory access to foreign funds," he said in his assessment.
Erol Gürcan, director of the Westminster Investment Consultancy, also said there had been quite a serious rerun of global stock markets following Trump's election as chairman in the United States in November 2016.
It is possible, he said, to say that the main factor triggering this Raleigh move is developments that have boosted Trump's expectations for global growth, particularly his pledges to cut taxes.
Borsa İstanbul was also at the forefront of the global rally.
One of the main reasons for this is that the BIST 100 index has remained fairly sketchy in recent years compared to similar emerging country markets, but there is a benefit in saying that steps taken by policymakers to support the economy and financial markets have also played a serious role.
In particular, we can say that the Credit Guarantee Fund (KGF), which became active through March, has had a serious impact on the rise observed so far in the index.
For the rest of the year, positive developments have been reflected in significant pricing, and KGF, which has an important role in this rise, is slowly reaching saturation, Gürcan said, adding that the search for a new story for the rest of the year may also be slowly gaining traction, even though the BIST 100 index remains skyrocketing compared to similar country markets.
In particular, Gürcan noted that the 180-day action plan, which had been eagerly anticipated for some time to be shared, included arrangements to support corporate profits, such as raising the Credit Guarantee Fund's limit, and possible tax cuts that have come up recently, could contribute positively in this regard.
Gürcan stressed that key developed - country central banks, such as the Fed, ECB and Bank of England (BoE), are also likely to tighten their current expansionary monetary policy standing, again among the critical risk factors for developing countries, adding that "it is likely that the Federal Reserve, which has been pursuing measured interest rate increases for some time, will be the key asset to the Fed's rate reduction programme in the period after September."
In the coming period, possible correction movements in the index are critical for the 104,150 - 104,600 support areas, which corresponds to the 200-hour moving average since the beginning of the year, Gürcan said, adding that if this support area is broken, the correction movement could continue until 101,700, 100,000, 99,200 levels, respectively.
If the current upward trend is maintained and the current historic peak level of 108,605 resurrections is broken, the index could rise by as much as 110,000 - 112,000, he said.

"It's a beat that needs to be done.

New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment test announced
The latest results of the refugee assessment tests, which are subject to a new medical age assessment method in Sweden, found that more than 80% of the participants in the test were older than 18, but not everyone trusted the accuracy of these tests.
Sweden's national forensic and pharmaceutical agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) began carrying out the tests earlier this year.
The tests are designed to make the age assessment more accurate in the asylum process after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for its failures to assess the right age of some refugees claiming to be minors.
So far, Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases to the test, and the forensic and Pharmaceutical Agency has now announced the results of a total of 2481 of the tests from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Of the 80% (2002 admissions) judged to be 18 or above, and in 25 cases, the Department of forensics and Medicine ruled that the experiment was "probably 18 and above."
In 432 cases, the result was that the person was "probably under 18."
Tests were carried out only in cases where the person's age was suspicious.
The results are consistent with past months, according to Johan Göransson of the Department of Forensic Medicine and medicine.
"We don't see a big difference in statistics from past months, the numbers are pretty consistent," he told the locale.
The high proportion of cases that are judged to be more than 18 years old does not mean that refugees are vocal about their age.
The agency announced the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases where "those examined were shown to be 18 years old or larger."
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of 581 cases released, it found that 243 cases had publicly declared that they had turned 18 this year.
The medical age assessment method, which involves filming the X-rays of 20-year-olds and making MRI screening of knee additions, then analyzing them to diabetics and radiologists, has been criticised in some quarters.
One of the sceptics is Claude Marcus, an endokrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, who evaluates the biological maturity of people whose work has been done sooner or later, whether the age of bullfighting has been entered earlier than usual.
"I have reasons to think about it and I think the type of measurement used should not be that.
It is very doubtful to decide the biological age in this way.
If we can't say exactly, we shouldn't do it as if it were, "he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson, of the department of forensics and medicine, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, the risk that a child is wrongly judged to be an adult is small.
The biggest risk is that the person is just under 18 years old, and in this case the risk is about 10%. "
But with the Turkish government's determination to open the dam on schedule, archaeologists have launched a large-scale effort to save items found in the area before it is submerged.

Coe praises Russia's'samimi' apology for doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, the boss of global athletics, praised Russia's apology, which he described as sincere, referring to the doping scandal, but stressed that the time was not right for the country to be re-admitted to the sport.
Dmitry Shylakhtin, Russia's athletics boss, told the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that it was right for his country to be banned from the sport and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he apologized to "all athletes whose gold and silver medals were forcibly taken from them in competitions."
Despite his assessments, the IAAF Congress voted to continue the ban in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored Doping in Russia.
"I think today is a very sincere response, a very sincere presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.
"The whole Council and the entire Congress were pleased... that the Russian federation accepted him, that he had survived the very turbulent days and that the Federation was doing everything possible to ensure his restructuring."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia had accepted the criteria for his re-admission.
"I think it's a very constructive day and I think the path has been taken, but Congress supports the suggestion that the task force is not the right time for Russia's rights to be restored," Coe said.
"We must do everything to normalise this situation over the next few months.
Our roadshow principle has always been to ask to separate clean athletes from the flawed system, "he added.
Eighteen Russian athletes who meet strict IAAF criteria will be competing as neutrals at the World Athletics Championships in London, which begin on Friday.

TYDTA chief Ermut: Foreign direct investment would be higher than last year
Arda Ermut, chairman of TYDTA, said 55% of all investment last year came after July.
Reporting that there was no reduction in investment because of the July 15 FETÖ coup attempt, on the contrary, Ermut said, "Maybe there would have been more increases, the ticket hit."
Maybe if these conditions did not occur, if not for some regional developments, we could have seen a further increase in the collision effect.
We are more hopeful for next year because of him.
Construction will be a brighter year in terms of direct investment.
We are already heading for the first 5 months, up 11% from the first 5 months of last year.
But we don't find that enough.
"We hope there will be more," he said.
"Both global and regional developments are not causing us concern," Ermut said, stressing that they are trying to diversify investors.
Ermut recalled that by 2010, 75% of direct investments normally came from Europe.
That figure dropped to 66 percent.
Again, Asia's share went from 2% to 7-8%.
Russia's share has increased.
We have had some problems with the Gulf states themselves trying to do that.
Turkey has good relations with all of them; Saudi Arabia and Qatar in particular are two key actors.
But the problem between these two countries saddens us and, in its way, makes investors delay their decisions a little bit more.
We may be experiencing some delays, not just in terms of investments in Turkey, but because of that.
Arda Ermut recalled that there had been some incidents over Germany last week, but that the government, especially President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, had shown clear and definite revulsion at this.
When they spoke to investors from countries experiencing the harshest policy crisis, President Erdoğan remarked, "Look, the problems are between governments, absolutely not between peoples."
Second, these people have come and invested in my country.
They are no different from Turkish companies for us.
On the contrary, when they have the slightest problem, they will come to us, we will solve it.
"We certainly won't let them become victims," Ermut said, noting that they continue to support all investors with the comfort of it.
"We can guarantee that in the period ahead," Ermut said.
You will see, neither German companies, nor investors from countries where we have some problems as policy in any way, will experience a shortage.
On the contrary, construcallah we will do our best at the point of increasing investment from these countries as well.
We think investment from here will continue to grow.
Of course, policy developments can sometimes influence perceptions of the investment climate.
"But we will do our part at this point and do our best with the aim that our investors, too, will not be affected by the perception of the investment climate," he said.
Ermut, chairman of TYDTA, explained that after the one-generation one - way strategy, Turkey is starting to get a lot of attention from China, but if the problems in the Gulf are resolved, they expect the biggest investment from the Gulf.
"In the relationship with Germany, we have been bored because of these relationships, we have had investments because of this incident, we don't even have investors," Ermut said, noting that there are companies that come, come and follow.
"Currently, close to 10 percent of the projects in our portfolio are owned by German companies," Ermut said.
That is, almost 10 percent of the companies we meet from around the world are German companies.
Some are companies already investing in Turkey.
The man is going to grow his investment, or he has an issue, and he's open as a project.
"So German companies are actually still a significant part of our daily business flow," he said.
Stressing that all state institutions should be careful at times of perception operations to Turkey, Ermut said the issue was sensitive and could be affected in the slightest miscommunication.
Ermut said what happened in the past 2-3 weeks was a good lesson.
The agenda of investors and politicians is always different.
We have always seen that; economic relations always make sure that political developments are put on some sort of path.
Germany will remain our key trading partner and an important investor.
Because it already has a lot of investments in Turkey.
The election agenda in Germany, unfortunately, increases such rhetoric.
I think when they go through it, they will go a little bit further.
In the case of Saudi Arabia, the two countries are careful not to make negative statements.
At the end of the day, an investor is investing in Turkey, targeting all surrounding country markets.
So there have been processes that have slowed down a bit, not because of Saudi Arabia but because of uncertainty in the region.
But we are still in discussions with these investors.
My personal view is that investors are now waiting for a decision that maybe they can take more quickly.
I see uncertainty because of the crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia in the 'negative sense, I'm getting out of here,' we don't have a Saudi investor.
On the contrary, we have Saudi investors who are still living in Turkey, who are on vacation here, who are meeting with us, who are following all their processes.
Arda Ermut recalled that international direct investment (UDY), which came to Turkey last year, was $12.3 billion, saying: "I think we will definitely pass it this year.
"But how far we will go, these regional developments, global uncertainties," he said.
While he hopes the normally collated effect will be more limited, perhaps with an 11% increase in the first 5 months, Ermut pointed out that it can be maintained, adding, "if construction is not a bad development, I believe we will definitely close the end of the year better than we did last year."
Pointing out that a significant portion of the investments attracted will continue to be real estate, Ermut gave the knowledge that new investments could be seen in logistics, health, fintech, it, petro - chemistry, food, energy and manufacturing.
Stressing that there will be new investments in the coming months when they make their announcement, Ermut said, "there may be an investment anonymously in terms of manufacturing anytime soon."
Not a billion dollars, but a big investment.
"There may also be investments from enterprising countries," he said in his assessment.

How will football's financial rules affect Neymar's departure to Paris?
Rules to prevent unlimited spending by European football clubs will not prevent Neymar's world record transfer from Barcelona, Spain, to Paris - Saint Germain, France.
With the power to mention teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament, any results could come from UEFA to Paris Saint-Germain, the governing body that oversees the European game.
Financial Fair Play rules issued by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to show that it financed the transfer of Neymar without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will not rule out a salary of tens of millions of dollars a year.
Some financial aspects of Neymar's departure to France are:
Given the team's money from the energy-rich Qatari family, PSG could of course pay the money to sign up to Neymar and add it to the other stars galaxy.
Clubs are allowed to spend loads of money to recruit players, but they have to balance it with legitimate sources of income, provided that it is dealt with in football-related affairs.
The FFP was designed by Michel Platini after he was elected UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs with huge debts in the pursuit of success were actively fraud and were at risk of bankruptcy if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP began monitoring the losses of clubs rather than focusing on their debts.
The change meant that the model, which Roman Abramović first used in Chelsea in 2003 (with the potential of a club al, a high - spending startup and a global brand to improve the team) would have turned into a more difficult enterprise.
During the 3-year FFP assessment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can lose 30 million euros.
Platini was uncredibly removed from the presidency in 2015, but his successor at UEFA, Alexander Ceferin, is still adamant about giving up on overspending.
Andrea Traverso, who runs the FFP at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week: "The FFP is certainly not dead and we will strengthen the rules by moving forward."
As much as PSG will pay for Neymar's purchase clause collectively, but for accounting reasons, it could extend the hold to the contraceptive period.
Neymar signed a 5-year deal, so the transfer fee could be cited as a cost of 44.4 million euros in annual accounts for the next 5 years.
The first wave in 2014 saw the introduction of the heaviest jihadists to Manchester City, owned by FFP, PSG and Abu Dhabi.
PSG was fined 60m euros ($82 m), which was later reduced to 20m euros, and was ordered to limit the Champions League team to 21 players instead of the usual 25 for the 2014-2015 season.
UEFA is vigilant against clubs that may try to cheat financial regulators by inflating their income through companies linked to the club's owners.
Although a Qatari company can sponsor PSG, if the value of sponsorship is thought to exceed standard market values, UEFA will not allow it to be counted as a justified income.
That was the case in UEFA 2014 when the Qatar Tourism Authority ruled that PSG sponsorship was inflated.
Part of Neymar's earnings from PSG could reportedly come through payments from Qatar's 2022 World Cup Organising committee.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will be a World Cup envoy, and such a move could easily be revealed by UEFA regulators.
Sanctions imposed on PSG in the past mean UEFA will be even more careful against trying to circumvent the rules.
UEFA is not in a pre-emptive discussion with PSG about the transfer of Neymar, according to those who have been foundational to the issue on Tuesday.
They were not authorized to talk about PSG's situation, they spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
Recent published accounts show PSG made a profit of more than 10m euros in 2015-16, with a turnover of 542.4 m euros.
Accounts for the last fiscal year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to contribute to sponsorship deals, souvenirs and format sales.
The club expects turnover to increase by at least 30% after signing up.
Clearly disturbed by the departure of one of football's biggest players, the Spanish league has tried to block Neymar's departure for allegedly violating PSG's FFP.
"This is an open case of 'financial doping' with his club and state," Javier Tebas, president of La Liga, told Spanish newspaper asas, referring to Qatar as the exact owner of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose own club is owned by an American sports giant, shares concerns about La Liga being financed by a state.
On Thursday, Wenger said: "This is a result of having and has completely changed the whole background of football in the last 15 years."

It is very difficult to respect the Financial Fair Play because for a country such a great player to represent a country can lead to different methods or different areas of interest.

Outcry over 'ceiling prices' from insurers
The insurance industry has been losing ground in traffic branches since 2006, according to TSB data.
The sector lost 2.35 billion TL in 2015 and only 19 million TL in 2016.
Borsa runs akinsurance, Anatolia insurance and solar insurance in İstanbul.
At the meeting, which assessed TSB's results for the first six months of 2017, cages said 11 years of losses in traffic insurance had reached 7.3 billion TL, with ceiling premium implementation forecasting the industry's losses to rise to 2.3 billion TL this year and an estimated damage - to - premium ratio to 125%.
This year, the 2015 figure will also be captured, cages said, noting that the losses written in 2012 and 2015 had also driven the profits of other branches, adding, "this makes sense; we are also raising the price of citizen housing policing by financing the bad driver."
"75% of the industry is foreign, and our partners abroad have somewhat financed the bad driver," he said.
Ages said.
We have no expectation of profit from traffic, but looking back at the past 11 years, we cannot show that we made a profit for any year.
"We accept that too, but we continue to hope that if we can carry that damage in a reasonable environment, along with other polyps," he said.
There were dramatic price increases when the loss in traffic took away the profitability of other products, ages said, adding: "In 2012 there were around 30% price increases in traffic insurance, almost doubling in 2015, we wrote the biggest loss in our history."
"Even in an environment where prices have risen so much, at the end of 2016, our wife in traffic was only 19 million TL," he said.
Age said they expected the free tariff to be passed next year, adding: "We will lower the price of the good driver in the free tariff and impose a high price on the bad driver."
"But the Treasury is looking at the overall trajectory, the final word on when it will happen is in the Treasury," he said.
The Treasurer's office said the rise in mandatory traffic insurance premiums from 2015 had affected a broad segment of society and introduced a maximum premium (ceiling price) from 12 April.
Each group of vehicles for compulsory traffic insurance poles, which will be regulated accordingly, set maximum premiums for compulsory traffic insurance on the basis of city groups, which are determined by baseline and traffic congestion, and accident statistics.
Meanwhile, as of July, the introduction of a "pool of risky signees" for the frequency of damage in compulsory traffic signees or vehicle groups has been implemented.
Premium and damage to traffic insurance Poles under the pool will be divided among insurance companies.
The premium for these signees will be identified by the Treasury undersecretary.
Age said that with the introduction of a ceiling premium, traffic was down 11.5% in the first 6 months of 2017 compared to the same period a year earlier, while the number of Poles increased by 4.9% to 8.6 million, while the discount on traffic Poles reached about 30%, given inflation.
This year, traffic will again see profits in other branches, cages said, adding: "With these ceiling prices, this damage is unsustainable.
How long can the industry bear this damage? "he said.
The capital of all companies in the sector is 9 billion TL, only 2.3 billion TL will be finished in three years when the industry is hit by traffic, cages said, adding, "the good driver for foreigners is financing the bad driver, why are my thousands of shareholders financing the bad driver in Turkey?"
"At this point," he said, "we're trying to explain our lesson to the Treasury."
Asked if foreigners were at the point of weight reduction in the Turkish insurance industry after these developments, cages said, "they are not there yet."
They expect to invest more in Turkey because they have an average of 6 poles per capita in the Netherlands, compared to 1.3 in Turkey.
"So Turkey is a place where it really needs to grow," he said.
So they haven't given up.
However, the company makes a reasonable profit every year, leaving all profits in the stands and using them for the company's growth.
According to TSB data, premium production in the sector in 2016 was 40.5 billion TL, compared to 23.1 billion TL in the first half of this year, up 12 percent from the same period last year.
Cages said it estimated the industry would not complete the year with 15% growth in total premium production.

Nostalgia for "ISIS Hot American Summer" and "Yoldash Detective"
So for the bright days of the characters in the 80s, it was time for the grunge era in the 90s (when Beatles such as David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketchy comedy "The State" for MTV), and for 2001, before their stars Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd continued with the bigger things, the story was all the same.
As a cultural product, this is both a tipping point for our era of permanent memorabilia Facebook.
But as a series, it's as if his time has run out.
"The First Day of Camp" was unexpectedly successful, and it wasn't just because of the absurd humor (inside, there was a story about the origins of a speaking box by H. Jon Benjamin).
By focusing on the real comic (the fact that middle-aged actors play minor Abrahamic children), he has made it impossible to recreate the past part of the joke.
Now, after "Ten Years," in which adults play adults, there is less emotional endurance, and more random, parodist, including a monologist for the hairy - haired film "the Hand that shook the Cradle" of the 90s.
At one point, the character mixes an Apple Powerbook, some one-on-one wheel skates and "a lot of other things from 1991."
Many of the real stories are the same.
The soft-hearted Coop (Mr Showalter) is now a writer, still unable to forget Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost sight of him.
There is also now another wild - haired plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr Showalter), a very well-rounded imitation by George H. W. Bush.
The best part of the series, as usual, is the occasional lyrics.
It is very pleasant to see Mr. Rudd, who is always young, especially with Matt Dillon's dud six beards in "the bachelorettes," the most popular child at the old school, Andy, now appears to be a Mormon.
There may be random crazy moments that give power to this series (for example, the "love Up!" series), which has a kind of resurrection, until it reaches what I think is the logical conclusion: "ISIS Hot American Summer: Twenty years later," in the final stage of it, a friend taught to go to see the premiere of the "ISIS Hot American Summer."
Meanwhile, the "Yoldash Detective" at Amazon addresses a different type of nostalgia: The Cold War resurrection of "The Americans," The film "yellow bomb" and even "GLOW" with iconography against East, West wrestling.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, the comedy, directed by Rhys Thomas, looks like found TV: a 1980s Romanian police drama in which two Bucharest police officers fought for truth, atheism and Marxist-Leninist path.
The headliners are played by kurt Gregor and idealist Iosef, Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, the English duo of their dialogue, Channing Tatum (who is also the lead producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some pleasant visual comics (Americans watch football while policemen spend time watching chess on TV)
There is also the famous soundtrack artist cast, which includes Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny; a good ingredient for the play "who is the voice."
But the "Yoldash Detective" is so dedicated to the realization of a propaganda drama that (including a murderer wearing a Reagan mask) often plays exactly like him.
Six long episodes do not know how to pass, and comedy is not quick enough or frequent enough.
Gregor and Iosef continued to visit the American Embassy, where there are two bottled men in the lobby who always eat a hungry wolf, while the "Yoldash Detective" could have better carried out the propaganda satire if it had been shortened to a narrow length.
His message to the imaginary Communist viewer is that Western culture can turn into a destiny that will defeat anything as Swift.

FETÖ "the ancestor of the woman
Fifty years of experience the British government has seen that our family is vile and sacrifice.
The government's Yuan authorities have acknowledged that this family has been instinctively attached to the British government since its inception and has provided great services.
It is ludicrous for the British government to be wise and careful about this fidan planted with its own hands, explore and examine everything and decide carefully.
In trying to understand the FETÖ, the starting point is the organization of the hashtags, but one noticeable difference is that FETÖ is an organization that emerged in the imperialist era and acted with colonial hair.
It is the 'pioneering movement' that should be addressed in this mindset.
In the British praise at the entrance, the man who describes himself as' fiddled with the hands of the British government is Mirza Gulâm Ahmet kadiy ', the founder of Qatar.
Gulâm Ahmed, a native of Qaraqosh, a small town in India's Pencap state, reported that "on 1 December 1888, God ordered him to take bias from his fans and create a separate community."
Gulâm Ahmed went a little further, saying that in 1891, according to vahiy and Iles, Îsâ b. Meryem died in a natural death, like other nebîts, while God sent him to mesîh and mehdal, where hristians and Muslims waited.
Accordingly, he is the same person as mesîh, who is expected by Muslims, and this is Mirza Gulâm Ahmed niqab.
(Encyclopedia, TDV)
In India, which came under complete British domination after the 1857 Sipahi uprising, Gulâm Ahmed, who wrote books defending Persecuted Muslims against Hindu and Christ, is reminiscent of the denomination with the presidency of the Anti-Communist Association in Erzurum, which is thought to have been founded entirely with mukaddescendant Saints, but whose CIA support has subsequently emerged.
Gulân Ahmad, like the same Gülen, is the most popular idea by imperialists, that "jihad" is just a struggle by Muslims with their own brethren, and that imperialism, whose religion can live freely, has no dimension to fight.
Even Gülen, if you remember, went a step further, praising the attacks of the Crusaders, whose wound in our history is still open, in a'way' last year: "It is not very dangerous for the Crusader to invade your country.
Because there are red lines between you and them.
Once in a while, they don't interfere with your woman, your daughter.
They are not Mabedinze, they are unconnected Crusaders!
The idea that Mehdi and mesihy are united in themselves, the idea that their community will be the savvy of ISIS, the idea that the concept of jihad only means the fight against nepotism, aside from the FETÖ, the way in which destiny is spread is generally carried out in education and civil society.
The total number of centres in the world of Cadbury, which is said to exceed 2 million, is 1869, while the number of countries where the emergency charity called "Humanity First" is officially registered is 23.
There are also data from 36 hospitals in 12 countries, 650 displays in 55 countries, 8 matbaa in Africa alone; 505 educational institutions in 11 countries; and about 16,000 mosques around the world.
Given that the Nobel Prize-winning "First Muslim scholar" Prof. Abdullah Khan, who served as president of the United Nations Court of Justice, is also the fate of the Muslim actor "Mahershala Ali," who received his first Oscar, we can see more clearly the depth of global authoritarianism towards cadres.
Let's note that their meeting in the UK last week with 30,000 people was also billed as a show of goodwill.
One of his slogans, "love everyone, don't hate anyone," is enough to take a brief look at their history to understand that Cadbury actually wants to say "love your occupiers / colonialists."
It is possible to extrapolate the outcomes and motivations of constructions such as Hülasa, FETÖ or Tahir-ul-Qadri, and all of these organizations are actually promoted as matuf to imperialism and to bankrupt communities in order to serve colonialism.

Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce soon that interest rates will remain unchanged, after it played down speculation that slow economic growth and spiralling inflation would be an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue "slowly" as household incomes shrink, leaving them holding interest rates steady.
Decision-makers on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to keep rates at 0.25%, so that fewer members wanted an increase this month after slow economic growth weakened support for a rise.
In its quarterly Inflation Report, the Bank cut its growth forecasts to 1.7% in 2017, 1.6% in 2018, and warned household incomes would continue to contract, with inflation still expected to rise close to 3% in the spring.
But he signalled that interest rate increases were needed to rein in inflation fuelled by Brexit in the next few years and said borrowing costs may have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the massive economic improvement package launched a year ago in the wake of Brexit.
Starting next February, the Bank will terminate its periodic funding plan, which offers cheap financing to banks, but expects to offer 15 billion more (£115 billion) under the plan, it said.
Minutes after the rate decision was made, the bank said: "The MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP), remains slow in the short term as the contraction of household real incomes continues to burden consumption."
On rates, he stressed that "some contraction in monetary policy" may be necessary to ease inflation and would be "one piece higher" than the market expected.
Markets are still predicting the first increase will be in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the Bank stresses that any increase will be "step by step" and "limited."

Pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision to remain unchanged came after the latest disappointing growth figures eased expectations of a prolonged rise, with the pound up 0.2% in the first quarter, compared with 0.3% in the second quarter.
Growth will probably remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but according to the bank, it will start to ease towards the end of the year.
The bank says the recession will get worse before the recovery, with the latest inflation report leaving little joy for household people hit by rising inflation and gentle wage growth.
The bank said monetary policy "cannot prevent" income from hitting in the next few years, but it expected wages to recover "significantly" towards the end of its three-year forecast.
Increased demand for UK goods as a result of the weak pound will support the economy by offsetting some of the falling consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after the shock EU referendum vote, which brought down the pound, cut rates to 0.25%.
The bank estimates it will likely take four years for this to impact prices and the economy altogether.
Before the bank's latest interest rate decision, there had been rising demand for a rate increase, with increased inflationary pressure on hard-pressed households and a call by three policymakers for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% in July to 2.6% last month, but the Bank said it was expected and would rise again in the coming months.
The bank said the vaccine was "entirely" related to powerless pound, according to their 2% target.

NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
In the High Court, after a battle over funding the drug in the NHS, patients will be able to access the 'preventable' HIV prevention treatment from September.
NHS England has announced that pre-exposure profiles (PrEP), a hap taken before sex, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk people by around 86%, will be provided by health services to as many as 10,000 people estimated through a 3-year pre - trial.
The high court's decision last year agreed to fund the experiment after the appeals court upheld the ruling, which said the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP, despite claims by local authorities to fund it.
The move, announced on Thursday, was greeted as a 'new and serious intervention' by the head of NHS England, Simon Stevens, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a 'predator.'
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to register the public, with more clinics taking part in October, with a UK-wide programme to be fully implemented by April 2018.
Pre-exposure proficiency (PrEP) is a series of HIV drugs that reduce the risk of HIV infection before sex.
Experiments have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means enough is found in a person's body to prevent HIV infection from occurring.
Such medications can be taken every day or almost two hours before sex.
Those eligible for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transgender people and HIV-positive partygoers, and those who cannot be successfully treated.
The clinics will determine the appropriate participants who will settle for the experiment from men, women, transgender individuals and unknown people whose HIV status is controlled by an antiretroviral treatment.
People living in the UK and registered with a practitioner can also register for potential participation at participating local sexual health clinics.
The programme will cost £10 million and NHS UK nations signed an agreement this week to provide the drugs with an offer tender.
The experiment is designed to assess Prep's full potential by gathering clinical evidence on how PrEP is targeted, conducted and implemented on a large scale.
Mr Stevens said: 'This new and serious intervention will contribute to a broad and increasingly successful effort at the prevention of HIV.
This is another milestone in three decades of development when it comes to lowering one of humanity's key health problems. '
Deborah Gold, president of NAT '(National Aids Trust), said:' This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
If it is properly targeted at those in need and those at risk, PrEP offers the possibility of transforming the HIV epidemic in the UK.
From now on, people at high risk of HIV, through this experiment funded by the NHS in the UK, will reach a new, powerful tool that is actually privately controlled to the person and is not open to negotiation with a wife; this will lead to the improvement of many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. '
Ian Green, president of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'The priority now should be to ensure that the experiment is presented rapidly across the country and that no one with a risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP experimental drug has been cleared, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV. '
Shadow public health minister Sharon Hodgson said: 'We welcome the start of the PrEP experiment and it has been late with months of delays and then the government's foot - dragging.
Evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our look at HIV prevention and the termination of this life-changing infection
The experiment will bring us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP altogether.
It is now important that this experiment is presented as quickly as possible across the country to protect people who are exposed to HIV and bring us a step closer to finishing the spread of HIV in society.

Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, went from a vast house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls courtyard in 2014 and went on to downsize.
The screen Queen is on the first floor of a mother-style scanner and proof of the new design that Joanne is convinced without picking up her bags.
"Before that, I was living in a much bigger area in Knightsbridge with my old love," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that mattered to me," he said.
The apartment in Earl court was shown to me and had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with him and made an offer that day. "
After the first view, the 1,000 ft dark apartment was renovated from scratch.
Initially, it was a one-bedroom, complex - planned property; you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom; Joanne wanted to add a storage space and a lift to take maximum advantage of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows and a lot of light.
It was my condition, "he says.
To this end, Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio hired Erfan Azadi of Duck & Shed to take advantage of the 12.5 - FT ceiling and create not only a structure but also a place for Joanne to live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two areas in a row, so the architectural challenge was to create a layer of noodles that could stand inside.
Erfan should have thought creatively to resolve the matter.
"The steel skeleton is quite complex," he explains.
"We should have adjusted the gaps so that they could be fooled without requiring a downward focus on each other.
It wasn't just building a simple platform, but the steel would have been such a trend that they would have been at the right height according to the upper or underlying functionality, "he said.
This arrangement brought a lot of additional drama, allowing Erfan to get two full boardrooms above each other.
The old type of copper light window, taken from Retrouvius for asphalt, looks at the magnificent living area below.
Mirrored gold-colored furniture, silver kicks and old-fashioned Serge Mouille lighting all determine the style of the bill.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding the venue, the space and the light.
The mirrors placed on both ends of the short corridor make it look longer.
The Mirror - scarred panel in the kitchen gives a sense of the window to another room.
The anthropomorphic units provide storage space for Joanne's all-rounder Knicks team and giraffe.
The beauty of the living room, which creates a more spectacular perception of space, is that it can cover the kitchen when it is not in use.
As soon as it closes, the kitchens are not new.
What is unique in this is that there is an upstairs door in the garage style.
"We used some engineering in it," Erfan explains of the reinforced skin MDF door.
"It has the weight of balance so it really shifts easily when you push the door up," he said.
With the intelligent use of space and storage space, Joanne earned an additional 16 square metres, an extra bedroom and an improved session plan.
"At the end of the day, the session space is what you're going to sell, or where the value of your property is determined," Erfan said.
"As an İptidai, a real estate agent will enter and make a calculation on the basis of the session space."
They were able to use quality material that gave the space its luxury outlook while increasing the ground there.
"The ingredients are objects you touch, so they help you build emotional connections at home," Erfan says.
'At home, you don't fall in love with the power lines on the wall.
They are important, but do not tie the wire of your heart. "
This is the Isle of Wight that an apartment through good design and upgraded square metres can turn into something quite amazing from a standard.
In fact, like Joanne, you can choose not to leave.

Brothers fight for $500 m property empire
Forty years after the dynasty founded by Italian families, the two brothers are at war for one of Victoria's biggest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and contractor Colin De Lutis lives three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who has given himself to the Supreme Court over how to allocate property and business assets at a property in Toorak.
Paul had wanted to get out of the family business since 2014, but there was fierce debate in the high court about the break-up.
Brothers Smith Street, with their mother Anna, owns 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars that have been accumulated since a shop in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco jeans and grew it into a chain with 160 retail outlets.
In 1999, it was sold for 85 million dollars.
The money was invested in the property, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento contracting sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartment buildings and shopping malls in the suburb.
As part of a deal with their father, who died, Colin (also referred to by Paul as a "significant driving force and dominant personality" in the Lutis family) owns two-thirds of the company's assets and one-third of Paul's.
A court filing says this means Colin has $316 m and Paul has $176 m worth of property.
For Paul, splitting property and cash is emerging as a contentious issue.
In his first sworn testimony to the court in 2015, he wrote: "The divisions proposed by Colin were leaving him with the property that I always referred to as the best of me."
After several failed mediations last Friday, the first Supreme Court hearing was held.
The brothers are also in a fight over who will control the current job; Paul claims Colin has left him out of the job.
Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of skillfully running some properties.
In an initial oath, Colin says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian roots dictate to me that family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Hundreds of pages of sworn testimony by firms including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, e-mails and Allan Myers, QC, along with the best lawyers and senior legal associates hired by both sides, are increasing costs in the case.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were a family of Italian immigrants who ran groceries and wineries starting in the late 1950s, and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They had housed Colin's property to buy the Collingwood property, where the family opened the first cot pantolon shop.
"In my final years in high school, when Paul was a little boy (in his 10S)," Colin says, "he founded Westco there."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hope to leave their property in a friendly way to their son.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," he wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the Lutis Group of Companies; when Colin said he left the job, he was paid 10 million dollars to Mark and 26 million dollars to Luke.
Both Luke and Mark were "dissatisfied with the terms of their financial separation," Paul said.
According to a 2015 biography of Eddi McGuire, the TV star's best friend, Colin tried not to pay attention, even though he was a former AFL club board member.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
"I can't say much," he replied with only Colin's text message, "because the case is in court."
"It was very, very sad that my brother Paul preferred to sue me and put our family name before the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court application that he was trying to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father didn't want Paul and me to fall into the current dispute," he said, adding that he was "still hopeful for a solution."
On Friday, that hope seemed to be lost.
"Our problem will be solved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new special plans to restrict the president's media diet.
Others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
If so, it would be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House Special will restrict the flow of information to President Trump (including news media reports) in the hope of keeping the boss more stable.
Some minor information from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new private heir to the White House, met with senior staff on his first day on the job, he summed up a fundamental problem that President Donald Trump plans to solve about the White House: that bad information gets into the hands of the president.
Kelly told staff that information should flow through him, whether on paper or through briefings, because the chairman would have been able to make better decisions when he was given good information.
Kelly's tank makes a lot of sense, but others have tried and failed to align Trump by overseeing the media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and he is now in the White House, TV watching is still in good shape.
"If candidate Trump is sorry for not getting a fair amount of coverage in the media, it has been versatile to show him that he has found fair space in persuadable media outlets," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
According to Politico's Tara Palmeri at the time, "according to six campaigners, the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control was to ensure that personal media consumption contained a steady flow of praise."
OK.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit is "under control" at any given time is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaigners know something that the rest of us don't know, for example, that Trump's tweets will be much more provocative if not for their interference.
We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump did not send.
If the Dodgers were able to get him out of danger a few times, then his efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to prevent Trump from constantly generating controversy.
Part of the problem was that the White House was made up of people who were competing with each other, i.e., people who were trying to advance their own agents with the material they presented to Trump (these could be reliable or unreliable), and people who put forward their own worldviews.
Politico reported in May that throughout this whole story, advisers strategically tend to convey sceptical information to the president.
One example detailed by reporter Shane Goldmacher was:
"Current and former Trump officials say Trump has reacted hydraulically to negative trophies from the press, especially leaks that have had a bad impact, and is self-contained to find out where they originated.
That was when someone gave the Speaker a printed copy of an article from internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson's website GotNews.com, accusing private equity deputy Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a series of leaks" at the White House.
It was not a matter of the fact that Johnson was fundamentally banned from Twitter for harassment, or that he did not present any concrete evidence, or that he had brought criminal charges and turned away from them in the past.
Trump read the article and began asking staff questions about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that then - special caller Reince Priebus and White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter "tried to put in place a system that handled and documented the paperwork that Trump received."
How did it end?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Maybe he will emerge as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still in his own honesty and his associates are still competing for influence.
These unchangeable factors will make Kelly's task quite difficult.

Crypto FETÖ "uncovered by private sheriff
İzmir public prosecutor Berkant Karakaya completed an investigation into alleged irregularities in the "military espionage investigation" and the leaking of some information, codenamed "Saracens," after the secret witness, Tümamiral Jabhat Yaycı, the chief of staff of the Naval Forces Command, told the FETÖ. "
The review stressed that Tümamiral spreadsheet was not a member of the organization but helped the investigating authority in the detection of members of the crypto organization in the Naval Command and played an active role in the fight against the FETÖ.
The resolution, which pointed out that Yaycı had tried to pacify the naval forces by ordering the so-called martial law order in the July 15 coup attempt, underscored that Yaycı had effectively fought against the FETÖ from the first day of the coup attempt.
"It is understood that the spreadsheet worked on the identification of the staff of the crypto Naval Command thanks to the special system for the identification of FETÖ members from the crypto - cellular services class, with 64 basic criteria and 209 sub-criteria."
It was concluded that it was not possible for the Chief Prosecutor's Office to predict an assessment of the spreadsheet, which is known to be an active anti-terrorist organization, as a result of the classified witness's struggle with afaki and the fact that there was no evidence against him, except that there was no evidence against him, which was preliminary in the criminal investigations.
The Tümamiral spreadsheet had previously been tried on charges of insulting.
Behind this, it was revealed that there was also FETÖ, and that the alleged crime was kumpas.
Former air Pilot Lieutenant Colonel Hakan Dinç, who was at the match where the spreadsheet insulted him, turned over the complaint, which was merely a note of information, to the document, former Adana İncirlik 10.

Italy hardens NGOs approach to migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue if they do not comply with new rules affecting their operations.
"If NGOs do not comply with the new charter, it will be difficult to see them continuing to operate," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Torino newspaper La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a boat operated by German charity Jugend Rettet on suspicion that its crew was actively collaborating with human traffickers to facilitate unlawful migration.
The charity, which has been active for just a year, declined to comment on the contents of detailed charges brought against them by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
In a statement on social media, the agency said: "For us, saving human life is and will be our most important priority, so we are very sorry that we are not able to work in the search and rescue area at this time."
"We can only make an assessment of the charges that are currently being made after we have gathered all the information and are able to make an assessment of the situation."
Italian officials had been monitoring Jugend Rette's boat, Iuventa, since October.
The crew is suspected of taking a boat full of rubber boats that were handed over to them by human traffickers and allowing smugglers to flee on boats, to be used again.
At least one such meeting, according to the prosecutor's files, whose content was published by Italian media, allegedly took place 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast.
The crew is suspected of failing to name the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the region because of humanitarian efforts rather than any other purpose.
According to the statute, it was supposed to be an Italian police officer who openly observed their activities in the doorway of boats such as Iuventa.
Of The nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations, only three have so far agreed to comply with the charter: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latest on Tuesday said it assessed the new rules as unnecessary but acceptable because they would not cause any "serious changes or hurdles" in its own rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said the sharp drop in the number of migrants arriving in Italy after last weeks's rescue was indicative that efforts to strengthen Libya's coast security and cooperation with local governors were bearing fruit.
He said: "We have started to see the light at the end of the tunnel in recent days."
This month, he announced plans for more talks with Libyan governors about economic development initiatives and measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving Chad, Niger and Mali in hopes of reaching Europe.

Get rid of the backflip in 45 minutes
Noting that only 5% of patients need surgery in the treatment of Bel fluids, Dr. Oz karaeminsons says, "according to the patient's examination and visibility results, the first step is medication treatment."

Michelle Carter sentenced for messages encouraging Conrad Roy's suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through messages and phone conversations.
Michelle Carter, who is now 20, will serve 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years as a torturer.
Carter was convicted in June of the gruesome murder of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on 13 July 2014.
Mr Roy's father said at Thursday's hearing: "The Heart of my family is broken.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was allowed to go free, to be clear.
Although he faces a maximum 20-year sentence, his legal team had argued that both he and Mr Roy were suffering from a mental illness.
Carter, wearing a red pantolon and cream-colored bluz, was fine, with old eyes, hands kennels and eyes on the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
To improve himself, he ended his life.
He did not accept responsibility, "he said.
"He didn't show any regrets," he said.
But Carter's lawyer said, "it was a terrible situation that he regretted altogether."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not see his "age, maturity level, even mental illness having any significant impact on his actions."
A prosecutor read out a statement by Mr Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying: "One day I will not mourn the loss of my dear son.
I want her to be proud of me and how I've overcome everything, and I'm trying to be with her sisters with all the pain that we will carry forever, "he tweeted.
Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said the fact that she would never be able to attend her brother's wedding, or that she could never still be with her children, was "out of his mind."
"It's a pain that will always be with me for the rest of my life when I'm together every day since I was born," he said.
Because there is no Massachusetts law that makes it a crime to tell a person to commit suicide, the case looks like it will create a drink.
When Mr Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014, Carter was 17 years old.

Judge Moniz ordered that he should not be allowed to take an interest in this case through the press, saying Carter wanted to draw attention through Mr Roy's death.
The case has divided legal views.
Among the minority who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of killing her British Chamber friend in Italy in 2007 before being lured two years ago.
"Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not imprisonment," the woman, Knox (30), wrote in the Los Angeles Times in a dissenting opinion.

The next 12 months are critical in reducing uncertainties.
The biggest incentive is to reduce uncertainties.
There is a strong government.
There is no political uncertainty.
Hopefully the uncertainties in our close geography will decrease as well.
By increasing our resilience to shocks with some reform, I believe we are putting Turkey on a growth trend above "5%."
I said that months ago.
The worst is behind us.
Gradually, we no longer have that energy, but rather the inclusive growth of our energy, the reforms that will lead to job growth...
That's why the next 12 months are critical.
reform from one side, uncertainty from one side, political uncertainty from the other.
Our chances of building are also diminished by shortages in our close geography.
Many of our classical markets have collapsed, whether we want to or not.
Like Libya, Iraq.
We are not just losing markets, we are facing a wave of migration of over 3.5 million.
When we look at the last 15 years, Turkey has grown 5.7% despite all these shocks.
Turkey, that is, we have sound problems.
Now, with some reform, we are increasing our resilience to shocks, putting some more of the question mark in investors' head, putting Turkey back on growth policy above "5%."

Why?

Morning "the headline saved his leg

One of those women is 36-year-old Mehtap Dursun.
Their pain, which began two years ago, chronicled their foot - base.
When the young woman, who had difficulty walking, was at risk of losing her leg, the hospital circled.
A friend suggested Prof. Dr. Yusuf Kalko.
The headline in the morning showed the news that 'Azerbaijan has saved the life of the minister of emergency situations.'
It then emerged that Dursun, who went to Kalko, was struggling with Buerger disease.
Prof. Dr. Kalko took the young woman to emergency surgery.
Dursun, who soon escaped his pain, is now being treated for oxygen.
Audi to modify 850,000 diesel vehicles as carmakers face reverse response
A day before audio's announcement, BMW said it would offer software upgrades in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chief executive said he believed there were "more intelligent options than driving limitations," referring to European cities, including Munich, where BMW is headquartered (where banning or limiting diesel vehicles is considered).
Daimler had said on Tuesday it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the firms described the moves as a recall.
European carmakers had intensely encouraged the use of diesel vehicles to help meet carbon dioxide emissions in Europe and the United States.
But azot oxides, starved by diesel engines, are cancer - constructive and can cause asthma.
The cost of equipment that automobiles must install to neutralise the pis smoke extracted by diesel vehicles is also rising, making it difficult for cars to remain competitive.
As German carmakers faced scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government was accused of inflating powerful car firms and ignoring the emissions of the problem.
Firms are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which concealed its use of the device known as the flammable device, adjusting emissions to comply with regulations when a car is tested and relaxing it in normal driving conditions.
Many Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, in audio's engine development department, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in Germany.
Former Governor Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian and for that reason is not protected against criminal extradition and could be tried in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was dragged into a German criminal investigation, which included Volkswagen; authorities expanded the United States-based investigation after accusing Audi of imposing a system to get rid of emissions rules in Europe.
Audio's inclusion in the investigation could be heavy on Volkswagen: the luxury carmaker has an excessive share of Volkswagen's profits.
Fishing jumps to every viewpoint
The president of the Turkish neurosurgeon Association, Prof. Dr. Yousef Shafiq, issued a warning not to throw fishing from 2m to 2m places, unsure of its depth.
Every year, thousands of people are at risk of a stroke due to neck-and-neck damage from diving into wet waters.
Neck fractures develop most frequently in the 5 or 6 "NIST shoulder.
The characteristic of the disruption is that it affects the nerves that feed the color and leg taps at this level, as well as the respiratory cues.
"In these types of accidents, our most cognitive body, the neck-and-neck omurga, is cut off or squeezed by broken-down omurga, and is non-functional," Prof. Dr. cages said.
"False first aid in shoulder injuries can not only increase damage to digestives, but also lead to death," he said.
Fishing in the water is fourth in shoulder injuries.
The average age of those injured is 20-29, and the majority are men.
Prof. Dr. cages said, "fishing should not be thrown into the water that cannot be seen."
"No matter how well fed, there can be a severe injury," he said.
Prof. Dr. cages also recalled:
Fishing can cause varying degrees of paralysis in cats and legs, depending on the level of omnipresence at the site of the damage caused by injuries.
You may be swimming, but the water can be deceptive.
The place that seems to be deep to you can be sketchy.
In the United States and Australia, there has been a 70% reduction in cases of foot-and-mouth fishing, thanks to warning sheets placed on seafood.
"In Turkey, 28 provinces are off the coast of the Sea, but in places outside İstanbul, unfortunately, there is not a single warning sign," Prof. Dr. cages said.
"In connection with these types of accidents, the health directorate of every pre-summer Prefecture, schools and social awareness project requires a remarkable possession of information lights or information boards in beaches and pools," he said.
Prof. Dr. Kadir Kotil, president of the Turkish neurosurgeon Association Spinal and Periferic neurosurgery group, suggested the following:
112 should be sought as the first job at the scene.
The neck should be fixed as much as possible, it should not be moved, it should be detected with a harsh catch.
The airway should be secured and the patient reverse subsidized for the drenching of the water that escapes into the lungs.
He should not be kept out of the legs and drunk to evacuate the water.
The shape disorder in the patient's neck should not be attempted to be corrected.
The neck may have been broken.
However, if the shoulder has not yet been damaged, the first aid and an inappropriate position to be given to boyna during the patient's transfer may be the reason why broken bone fragments pressure the shoulder and cut and damage it.
He also said there was no reason to postpone talks on fishing and foreign policy because the dispute over border traffic between Croatia and Slovenia had been resolved.
Serbian authorities are considering banning political groups that threaten others, officials said on Monday (September 22nd).

Journalist's murder highlights growing threat in Mexico
In Sinaloa state, the staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet with their counterparts to review the latest turmoil exposed by organized crime, unfettered officers and plans for unfinished drug wars to appear in the paper.
But on this day, they came together to talk about their safety in the shadow of their own tragedy.
They were told it was important for them to change their routines.
Two senior journalists discuss what makes them feel safer: whether to bring their children with them to the office, which was the target of a hand grenade in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on top of the black wood in front of the room: harvests, neutrals, allies.
Ask reporters to propose names for every piece of milk; no evidence is needed, perceptions and internal voices are enough.
Suspected drug traffickers, politicians, businesspeople, government or cartels on pay, journalists are the bad man who made a list of Mexico's chaos dangerous to write in the newspaper.
There are no casualties, and even more are journalists nationwide: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, President Enrique Pena Nieto has been at least 25 since taking office in December 2012; 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and at least seven have died in seven counties so far this year.
Among the recent dead are editors and inspirational Riodoce founding partner Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez writes in one of his many books on narcotic violence.
His absence is deeply felt, but his presence is everywhere, with a large photograph showing Valdez's middle finger hanging on the front of the Riodoce's building with the word "Justice"; two reporters in his 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing his laugh, glassy face and alametifarthick, the Panama hatch.
The study takes place two months before his death; reporters talk about their shared trauma, nightmares, sleepiness, paranoia.
In 2010, a special federal prosecutor's office was created to handle journalist cases, but according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, it prosecuted only two.
As with most of the thousands of murders attributed to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought before the law.
In riodoch; their hearts are broken, but they insist on addressing the violence in Sinaloa, even though the ground is now more deceptive.
Without information about the killers, without justice, it takes very little to discuss security, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to spend my time in this study," she said.
"As long as we don't know why, you don't trust anyone," he said.
On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left his Riodoce office in Culiacan, the provincial capital.
The red Toyota Corolla was only a few blocks away before it was stopped by two men; he was forced out of his vehicle and shot 12 times, for the name of his newspaper, which has been translated as the estimated tenth River.
The gunman boarded his car and drove away and crashed the vehicle nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He is survived by his wife and two adult children.
In Culiacan, gossips tend to circulate freely.
But when it comes to Valdez, there is virtually nothing but silence.
Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, with rival groups battling to fill the gap after Guzman's arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January.
In Sinaloa, empty the fact that one or many people are shot and killed every day on the street, or that the cemetery is full of drug kingpins with their suitcases, two-storey, larger mausoleums than many houses that are there to live in.
For one minute, just forget the "calm" situation when the single cartel controls valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Despite this, and despite being deeply aware of the dangers of Valdez's job, Riodoce's founding partner and director, Ismail Bojorquez (60), was devastated by the guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He believes the two mistakes contributed to the murder.
First, there was the interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival cartel groups that was at war with Guzman's sons in a February broadcast.
This article may have angered the sons; prospective gang members bought every copy of the raid as soon as it was distributed to newspaper outlets.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety, after another newspaper with the same story was seized.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing was seen as a turning point in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived for a very long time, his friends and colleagues always realised he would be there.
He was an experienced reporter in noroeth in 2013 when he joined his five colleagues by selling shares worth $50 in the discovery of Riodoce.
"It was impossible to do journalism without addressing the issue of narcotics," Bojorquez said in Sinaloa.
Over time, the newspaper gained a reputation for its bold and honest coverage and increased advertising with the sale.
Reporters were keen to publish lifesaving research without fear of censorship, and readers had themselves trapped in a publication where they could read stories that no one dared to communicate.
Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for his reporting in Latin America eight years after it was founded.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists because he had the courage not to let go of the beating, no matter where the Mexican drug story is based.
He admitted he was clearly afraid.
"I want to continue to live," he said during the CPJ awards.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompuy TV.
"As a journalist, you have to accept the task that falls to you," he said, either playing this or stupid.
I don't want to be asked 'What are you doing in the face of so many deaths... why not say what's going on?'
Riodoce staff Miss Valdez; his friends, who like hamal are generous in their embrace and nourishment, know how to survive...
They had confidence in his routine.
He was always wearing his hats.
He would go to the bar in front of the office, Al Guayabo, and he would always sit at the same table.
Now they ask: has his love for his routines collapsed?
His death forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and survive.
"If you deal with their women, with their children, with their clean jobs, with the hidden plane tracks they use to transport drugs, they don't like that," he said.
"These things were to cross the border," Bojorquez said.
The result was a high degree of self-censorship and self-protection, even at the best time.
Relying on their own instincts.
If bad smell is coming, it is distant.
"The smell is a deceptive feeling... and it was what happened to Javier," said Andres Villarreal, editor-in-chief of Riodoce.
He and others say the old rules do not apply in Sinaloa; they do not apply in the same Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other provinces that host profitable trafficking routes, weak institutions and unfettered government officials...
The ground is constantly changing.
No mobile phones are allowed in the room where Riodoce staff meet for security training; days ago, it was revealed that spy software sold only to governments was used to keep an eye on journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers wanted to avoid the 104-degree (40 - inch) heat, in the shadow of a tree.
They were assigned by the provincial government to protect Riodoce's office, which is located in a four-story building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
The half-joke was semi-serious, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers were from the 50% inside police, which the governor himself said was unreliable.
Correspondents were months into the mountainous countryside, which drug gangs de facto control.
In this week's edition, Riodoce takes up three main stories.
The murder of former great boxer Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.
There was also the disclosure of government spending concentrated on the governor's hometown.
Then there was the kidnapping of a group from the prosecutor's office in Culiacan's most expensive restaurant, a block away.
There was no official explanation of who was kidnapped or how, so when it was time to write what everyone in the city knew, caution prevailed: the restaurant was in the eyes of both drug traffickers and authoritarians.
A reporter learned from official records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician from the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) who dominated almost every level of politics last century.
Many PRI governors have recently been accused of corruption in sensational incidents.
Villareal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at the scene, including the escape of one of "El Chapo" Guzman's sons in a soldier raid.
Just months ago, readers would have been looking at Valdez's column for information from the best source about the abduction.
"We would already know what happened before," said Villareal (46), who was nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his humble structure.
"All our communication channels with our resources have now been cut off."
Staff never expected something, activists on behalf of the press, to turn up, while Valdez's office is being reused as a warehouse for banners and stickers protesting journalist killings.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez waved a few banners and appeared at the local prosecutor's office the next morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body has been found, and according to DNA tests, official officials say it was him.
Across the country, journalists were more loudly expressing their thoughts by writing "help the press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
Today Governor Bojorquez is trying to secure international support for justice in the case of Valdez, in far-away Washington.
At a meeting with the Sinaloa Governor on the day Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
After that day, he asked to be appointed to another post for making government news, thinking that his anger had undermined his neutrality.
Valdez continued, saying that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organized crime, crime partner official officers and a nuanced society.
In his latest book, which he called "Narko - journalism," he wrote that journalists are being killed not only by drug gangs, but by politicians and security forces who are collaborating with organized crime.
Media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists last year to police and official officials.
"You Die in Mexico because they want to silence you," Ramirez said.
The killings clearly had a chilling effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago in the northern border province of Tamaulipas.
His body was found along with a note said to have been signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my news."
A computer keyboard and soundtrack next to his broken head.
Some publications, such as Al Norte, opted to close after reporter Miroslava Breach was killed in March in Chihuahua, a northern border province.
Others, like Al-Manana from Nuevo Laredo after their manager was killed in 2004, remain.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad addressed drug cartels with an editorial on the front page of Juarez: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their own province, or even the country.
It's a burqa decision.
It is hard to find work in exile and they are still scanning the streets waiting for danger.
Sometimes they are seized, as will be understood, from photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was murdered in an apartment in Mexico City with four women in 2015, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue to work, this is a daily dance with high-risk decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, says she feels scared to report the drug trade.
"Mexico is going to hell, and I'm a reporter for that reason," he said.
At midnight on a recent Saturday, as preparations were being made to finish the final countdown, Riodoce editors sat on the sidewalk outside the office, drinking beer and stealing phones at the same time.
A series of armed clashes involving rival gangs and security forces near Mazatlan, a resort on the coast, led to 19 confirmed deaths.
The war was continuing to escalate, as promised in a series of cartel messages found in the vicinity.
Through mobile phones on the sidewalk, they put the news on Riodoce's website.
The front page would have had to be changed the next day.
Sirens began to blare nearby, there is a clash with another weapon in the vicinity.
Bojorquez swiftly turned a blind eye to the police officers who stood guard to see if they were vigilant.
If they were afraid, they didn't show up.
Under the huge portrait of the newfound founders of his papers, his middle finger was on display for all of Sinaloa to see, while Riodoce's cast was tracking his feet.
"How can you think about closure," Bojorquez said, "on the day that Javier was killed, when the intern asked me to send him outside to make news on the street?"
He used public opinion to avoid dinosaur enemies.
At first glance, it looks like a statue, but to a terrible one.
Researchers have now revealed that initial findings of an incredible creature in the gergedan dimensions found by a Canadian miner are very well preserved, with experts describing it as the 'dinosaurs' Mona Lisa.
They were so well preserved that they could understand that the stamp magazine was Brown-eyed and said it had a 'troublesome back'.
The report in the Current Biology magazine described it as' the best preserved armored dinosaur found and one of the best dinosaurs in the world. '
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodozor that lived 110 million years ago, beginning in the middle of the Kretase era.
His exceptionally well-preserved situation has stunned researchers, who have described him as a 'ger - shot wonder'.
Plant - eating armored is the best preserved fossil of its kind, according to reports in National Geographic.
He was found by Shawn Funk while excavating the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta Canada on 21 March 2011.
He hit something that seemed strange, according to the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The discovered fossil Royal Tyrrell was sent to the Paleontology Museum.
They spent the next 6 years uncovering the wild animal from the contents of the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) landfill.
After so much hard work, the completed result is now ready to be revealed.
Lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is on display, said: 'If you cut your eyes a little bit, you can even believe that it is almost sleeping. '
'As one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur species in the history of science, it will pass as the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs. '
By studying its lesson, the researchers found that although it was covered with an armored and walking tank, this plant food was probably facing a serious threat from dinosaurs eating meat.
The dinosaur, which is heavily armored, used its red and white camouflage to hide from diamonds, and used a protective technique known as contra - sham, also used by many modern-day animals.
Experts say it is hunted down by larger dinosaurs, allowing it to better interfere with its environment and bypass its enemies.
The creature, from the 110-million-year-old nodozor family, made headlines in May and is currently on display at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
The researchers have now finished their work and have named the ithafen wild animal Borealopelta markmitchelli to museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of the team who spent more than 7000 hours relentlessly trying to uncover it.
The extraordinary preservation of the species made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and his international team of scientists to document the shape of the pulses with the debris and the armoring on the body.
The animals discovered the contraceptive shade, which is a common method of defense in the brain and means that the upper part of the creature is more sheep from the lower side.
Although contraception is common, the findings are a surprise because the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the Contra - shaded animals that are alive today.
It means that the dinosaur is sufficiently pressured and hunted by dinosaurs who eat meat, while evolution is eaten to face storage as a method of survival.
But the most modern animals that use the contraceptive shade (for example, deer, zebras or armadills) are much smaller and much more open to being a hunter; it means that nodozor has faced a serious challenge to survive.
Brown said 'the strong hunting for a huge, heavy - armored animal shows how dangerous dinosaurs in the Cretaceous can be.'
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their pulses also revealed that the lesion of the dinosaur was Brown.
Scientists are continuing to examine the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved binge contents, to find out what it eats in its final dish.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and plunged into the sea, it sank into the back ocean surface there.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as south Florida is today, and probably rivers and oceans spread much more content than they are now.
"Nodozor is truly remarkable, covered and preserved with complete pulse compression, while at the same time the original shape of the animal is preserved in a 3D way," Brown said.
'The end is that the animal looks almost the same today as what it looked like in the Early Cretaceous.
You don't need much imagination to rebuild it; if you cut your eyes a little bit, you can even believe it almost sleeps. '
Kretase was the time when the giant theropods, the meat obur dinosaurs that stand at two feet above, toured the Earth.
The King of all but Tyrannosaurus rex lived for millions of years after the armored dinosaur Borealopelta, which may have been hunted down by a number of his heyday ancestors.
Among them is Acrocanthosaurus, which is 38 ft (11.5 m) long and weighs 6 tonnes.
Scientists, whose latest findings are in the Journal of Current Biology, believe Borealopelta was dragged into the sea after his death and mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk while excavating the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta Canada on 21 March 2011.
According to the museum, the best preserved armored dinosaur, including leather and armored, is this and is complete from nose to thick.
The creature averages around 18 ft (five metres) and weighs up to 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
There are 2 20-inch necklaces on his shoulders.
Researchers believe this armored ot obur circulated cumbersome in what is now western Canada until it was dragged into the open sea by a swollen river.
But dinozorun's tomb under the sea preserved its armory in perfect detail.
The fossilised remains of this particular species are so well preserved that leather fragments still cover tumultuous armored floors along the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, this degree of conservation is rarely as rare as winning the "lottery."
The more I look at him, the more incredible he is.
Fossilised leather fragments still cover the tumultuous armored floors, which are the spot on the dinosaur's skull.

Let's say I don't have your teeth
Bemwhite teeth and an aesthetic smile are every person's dream.
As people resort to ways to inflate their teeth, neuroscience Berk, president of the Oral Laser Applications Association, warns that they should stay away from products sold in the market or on the Internet.
Such substances sold are colored with mine surface, so that there will be no recycling again, says neuroscience Berk, adding that "the teeth can be supplied with fine porcelain surfaces, such as chemicals applied by dentists, or with the surface of teeth."
Protecting dental health prevents the formation of many diseases, and aesthetic practices are important both for Dental and dental meat health and for mood health, Berk said.
As long as there is no disruption in dental structures or genetic factors, teeth are usually inflammatory.
Due to aging, draining of dental minds, and the frequent consumption of cigarettes, vaping or sheep - colored beverages, diets will take more Bay color over the years.
The wording of the teeth can be provided with fine porcelain surfaces, such as implants, which are applied with chemicals applied by dentists, or with minimal or no vaccination on the surface of the teeth.
Teeth should never be worn with products sold in the market or on the Internet.
Because, if these substances make the mine surface, the teeth collide so that there will be no recycling again.
The municipality of Keeling provides "Dental and mouth health care at home" to the elderly, disabled and bedridden citizens of the 2011 "den."

We called the municipality, they came instantly.
"I don't neglect my dental care if it's not at all thanks to this service," he said.
Kezban Gökçe, the 72-year-old daughter of gullizar tashoglu, 95, who lives in the pinnacle neighbourhood, said, "My mother has been dependent on the bed for 7.5 years because of old age."
When I arrived in the municipality, I saw posters of this service and immediately called.
We have been receiving this service on a regular basis for 4 years.
There is a problem with my teeth, they look at me when the doctors come in.
"We are very pleased," he said.
There is also no health guarantee requirement for the service, which is completely free.
"Severity" incident in Turkish army
My dear readers made very interesting decisions, especially for naval forces, at the High Military Council (age) meeting the previous day.
He was commanded by a rear admiral, not an admiral.
It is an almost unprecedented practice in our military.
But how did it happen?
The Force Commander, General Admiral Bülent Bostanoğlu, would have already retired...
And it happened.
Veysel Kösele, now commander-in-chief, was the only Admiral.
Veysel Pasha, who has been a victim of kumpas in the past and has been detained for some time, was supposed to be a commander in the regular severance rank.
But the government didn't want him.
I try to explain very simply, if we start from the top in the Naval Forces, the commanders of 1, 3, 4 and 5 have not been promoted.
In this case, he was the only rear admiral in the Naval Forces.
The vacant post was supposed to be brought to him: Navy commander in number two, Admiral Veysel Kösele.
What happened afterwards?
Rear Admiral Adnan Özbal, who is in sixth place, was appointed by that makama government.
Now you look at the picture!
Admiral Veysel Kösele is standing there, but is being replaced by a lower-ranking commander!
A senior is put on the order of your seniority.
What happens next?
A rank-and-file Admiral does not serve on the order of a lieutenant general who is inferior to him, he cannot.
He doesn't take orders from her, he can't.
In this case, Veysel Kösele will not participate in this incentive, if he does not retire, he will step down today or tomorrow.
That is the incendiary message that has already been given to him by the government: "Wrestle Veysel Pasha!"
The news that he had resigned yesterday in the afternoon, when I wrote this article, had spread, but the situation had not yet been officially announced.
Now let's look at these things again!
The government opposed Veysel Kösele for one reason or another, he didn't want, he forced his resignation, and he brought a 6th-ranked Vice Admiral to the command instead, undermining the traditional "severity" of our military.
And if there is politics at work, we don't know behind the scenes.
Maybe soon we will learn together if someone tells us!
My dear readers, I tried to explain very briefly above, it was very important, especially in the Turkish army.
Not just as a rank.
The officer who finished 10th in the Military Academy, for example, is shorter than the one who finished 11th.
Being promoted to general from first place is shorter than being promoted in second place.
We have experienced concrete examples of this severity in İstiklal Harbach.
Garp Front commander İsmet Pasha...
There are two armies in his order.
Army and 2nd Army.
We have arrived in 1922, our armies will carry out the great combat and chase the Greek army.
There are valuable figures expected to be appointed Army commander at this stage.
One Refet (Bele) Pasha.
He is being offered army command, but says "İsmet is short of me, I can't go on his rant."
Another name is Yakup Shevki (Subashi) Pasha.
Atatürk's Hobbit at the Military Academy...
He is a valuable and senior commander who has been involved in various wars, where he loves, values, "Hockey".
In 1919, he was captured with soldiers and civilian Turkish intellectuals and driven by the British to the island of Malta.
On his return home, he is reluctant to take military command and says the same thing: "The commander of the western front is short of me, I cannot take orders from him."
But Atatürk convinces him of the rica minnet, and Yakup Shevki Pasha is the commander of one of our two armies.
The third is a very colorful name...
Ali İhsan (Sabis) Pasha.
He is a very talkative, constantly critical soldier.
He is a commander who has fought in Iraq, the Caucasus, İran and on various fronts.
He is exiled to Malta by the British, fleeing there and arriving in Ankara via his siege.
When he was offered military command, Ali İhsan Pasha said the same thing: "I cannot fight in the order of İsmet, who is inferior to me"...
But persuade...
But see the bride, after his inauguration, constantly debating with İsmet Pasha, the commander of the Garp front, where he entered his order, making an incident and displacing the military...
And shortly before the great assault, he was sacked and retired, replaced by bearded Nurettin Pasha.
Afterwards, Ali İhsan Pasha's relationship with Atatürk never recovers.
In the Turkish military, the problem of severity is not only in war, but also in peace.
Of course, it has to come out.
Veysel Kösele is the latest example of this.
One activist had to learn how to answer the question "Who are the streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was deeply shaken.
A day after arriving in New York City to take a tour, he sat in the bedroom of Airbnb, where St. Louis rented the place, and began touring on Facebook on his phone.
Shared by someone from high school.
"The police killed a child a little bit ago at the age of 18 and he is still lying in the street," she said.
He was surprised when he realised that no one else shared the information, shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user called @ TheePharoah was continually tweeting about it again in the flow of content.
The St. Louis - area rapper tweeted live about Michael Brown's death, at the age of 18, an unarmed black man was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He shared a photo of Brown's serenaded body on the street, which will stay there for 4 hours.
"This is brutal," Ferrell thought himself.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
He left his phone to return to tweets about the gathering of people at Canfield driveway later that evening.
There were police banners, shouting people and photos of a man claiming to be Brown's father, holding a banner reading "Ferguson police killed my unarmed son a little bit ago!"
A live broadcast was watched by a police officer standing with a dog who blew himself up in front of a group of protesters.
In another video, another police said, he set up the thesis of his rifle and shouted: "I will kill you all... animals."
"He said, 'This is not getting used to,'" Ferrell recalled.
"He said, 'This is not the kind of murder we're used to and it's typical.'"
At that moment, I felt terrible.
I was angry and crying, "he said.
He set aside a return ticket and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 pm the night before, he took his 6-year-old daughter from his father's home and decided to go to Ferguson with him the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years will come to cinemas on 11 August, the subject of a new documentary, "who are the streets?"
It is a story about survival and protest, love and loss, power and resistance from the point of view of the people who live in that community and fill the streets with the answers they are looking for.
As Ferrell drove his vehicle to Ferguson with his daughter, who was wearing a flower elbow and wearing a suitable crown, they returned to talk about "the experiences of the black people and the situations of the black people" they had done several times before that morning.
"Do you remember that I taught you that black people should fight because they believe?" he recalled.
'Right now, we're going to Ferguson because the police killed a child at the age of 18 and that was not true.
I couldn't take him, "Ferrell said later.
"What happened here today... is the result of what happened in the past.
He should know, see, and grow up in it.
Not only should we develop well in activism and organizing, but we need to know the layers of the black experience and the black situation, and what we need to do to liberate ourselves.
I told him that if I was lucky enough to have an experience that he would not personally experience bullying racism, there would be no difference from any black woman - child.
I feel like I'm going to make him evil by protecting him from all that, "he said.
When they arrived in Ferguson, their first stop was on South Florissant Road, which turned into a kind of campsite for activists, as they waited to talk about the issue, which was opposite the police headquarters and which resulted in Officer Darren Wilson later being denied criminal anonymity.
There, Ferrell and his daughter connected with local business owners who prepared packaged food.
They prepared bags and helped transport them to the protesters.
For Ferrell, a new activism was slowly taking shape.
"My activism has completely transformed after 9 August," he said, noting that while he was a student at Missouri State University, he was president of the Union of minority students nurses and focused on food justice and health in the black community.
"I had no experience of organizing.
He was spontaneous. "
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, at an evening screening.
Folayan said he and his own apparel director, Lucas Alvarado - Farrar, wanted to "document" what was going on.
Ferrell had a question on his mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story you can use?"
This skepticism was reported by countless people, usually infidels; to come to a community and benefit from its pain and resilience...
As Folayan explained in a nearby interview: "We had heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson could not be concentrated, and we decided to do it in a different way."
Folayan had already linked up with regional artist co-director Damon Davis, known for his activism about prisoners who had been sentenced to death.
His participation warmed Ferrell to the project, along with six other regional locals, and the "who are the streets?" team followed in the years after Brown was shot.
David said: "This documentary is not about someone talking to us or talking to us; it is about us talking."
"The main thing for me was," this is how these people will be represented because this is how I will be represented. "
"While the goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience," Folayan said, the move was "not about a mesih leader, it was about bringing the community together, it proved to be the most open of film participants."
As a result, "who are the streets?" surprisingly documented personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as the fact that he fell in love and married his wife.
"I felt like a blip," Ferrell said, laughing at his first view of the finished product.
"But while I was doing this job and humanizing black people, I didn't understand that there might be some sensitivity," he said.
In addition, Ferrell's story solidifies the role of Black gay women in the Black Lives Matter movement and puts them back at the center.
Two of the movement's three founders, who derived the # BlackLivesMatter slogan on social media after the murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, describe themselves as gay.
"Black gay women in leadership have generally kept the movement afloat," Ferrell said, "and that's because we are constantly at war on several fronts.
Black gay women have to bear the full weight of it. "
Folayan agreed, saying: "The movement is really dominated by black women and a lot of gay black women."
Still, Ferrell insists that "this is not something that happens in the ACT fountain," and that he was not chosen because of his identity.
"He was the one who put that energy into action," she said.
'But it is not a pity that she is in the forefront, because as a black gay woman you have a lot to lose by living a life in these intersections.
You can feel the energy of it from the screen, "he said.
Meanwhile, news cameras have already gone up in Ferguson, but alarming racial connections remain between the community and the police.
Ferrell is under surveillance for another 2.5 years for closing the highway during a demonstration.
My house describes the socio-political atmosphere in the area as "messy" in one word.
Still, exactly three years ago, when he took to the streets of Ferguson, he was meeting the song he had excavated in his memory.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We should love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose other than our chains. "
George Vulgarakis: I think it is obvious that we are effectively addressing the issues.
Kukan: again, while I do not want to speculate on the future of dialogue, I believe a practical and political solution will have to be found.

Münasip a similarity: the artist uses Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits
In the middle of the room at the New York Fridman Gallery, yelling through cables in the ceiling, there are a lot of white, black and brown faces, each of which resembles almost certain uncertain ones.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey - Hagborg, with soundtracks and cut-out hair sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning, a former intelligence analyst who is serving his 35-year sentence after leaking classified diplomatic messages through the WikiLeaks website, as he is known, sent his cut-throat hair from Fort Leavenworth prison.
The name of the new exhibition, which opens on 2 August, is an isolated similarity.
It is a product of a two-year correspondence between Dewey - Hagborg, who combines his discipline with his expertise in technology, computer science and the arts, and Manning, a trans - woman and leading dissident whose sentence was pardoned by Barack Obama three days into his term.
Dewey - Hagborg, who created 30 portraits by analyzing the DNA algorithmic from Manny and using what a person with this gene database might look like, revealed only that there are many ways in which DNA data can be processed (and not the determination that comes from the essence of the comments), but also his identity with a tight, perhaps somewhat bearish interpretation.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edwards but publicly identified himself as a woman in more adolescence, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six of espionage, computer fraud and theft.
He was put under pressure by prison, so he had only one Photograph: a black White Apocalypse, in which Manny, who was visibly Teddy, sat in the driver's seat, wearing a platin yellow percussion with him.
In 2015, Dewey - Hagborg was making the 2012 project a success with the huge tranquillity of strange predators.
In it, he produced extra portraits of DNA from the smells of forensic pieces such as cigarette butts and beard to paint a picture of what these people might look like.
Just in time, he received an email from Paper Entertainment.
"They were doing an interview with Chelsea Manning while he was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait that could accompany this article," Dewey - Hagborg explained in a press release of the new exhibition.
At that time, he could not visit, his photo could not be taken, so they reached Chelsea and asked if he had an interest in making a DNA portrait.
He and his imprisoned preacher were unexpected letter friends, exchanging many letters over the course of two years.
They even discovered the suppressed signature, a book of cartoons illustrated by Shoili yasgo, in which the speaker pardoned Chelsea's sentence and imagined a future in which he could personally see the exhibition.
Obama's request for Manning's release, indeed a few days after the book was released, was a kind of happy coincidence that came well after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas.
While Donald Trump has found new, tweetable ways to exacerbate the sharp divisions that are being asked to infiltrate information about the government and transgender soldiers to wage war and repress himself, there is also something deep and powerful about this exhibition that is now opening.
When asked about the strange timing of all this, Dewey - Hagborg said, "events happen for a reason."
A written artist declares on the wall of the gallery, meaning Mannings' signature on my husband's dimensions is below that (the point of his "i" letter was set with heart), calling for an end to "automatic discrimination" based on gender, race, sexuality and culture.
Across the wall is his mitokondrial DNA sex: a lot of Cs, Gs and A'S written with lead thickness...
Dewey Hagborg, by incorporating 200 letters (or, according to the artist's sophisticated Dictionary of sophistication), all of us, at least as biblical, wanted to explain how much we like each other.
"What I hope people will get out of this is that they don't care about who we are and how much the genetic database is open to interpretation, how subtle it is," said Dewey - Hagborg, who was on display for video business Instagram moments in 2007.
"DNA data can tell a lot of different stories, and that's 30 of those stories," he said.
The final piece in the series, which is kept in a single room, is a page from the previously promised short-line novel.
Here, Manning, King Kong - style, is shown with a loudspeaker from the United States Disciplinary Barracks.
"They silenced your speech or won," she writes.
"So, never susma."
"This came as a direct from a letter he wrote to me," said the artist, who is from Philadelphia.
"When I'm still talking about it, it's childish," he said.
Manning has yet to personally see the exhibition (as he quite predictably dropped from the book of cartoons), but when he sees it, he will be greeted by mascots, his own genetic imitators, who gathered like a group of protesters in the middle of the room.
Like everything in the sequel, genetic haploids were written with lead thickness (5 "2, Manning ') to the thumb, and this was especially so.
"I've asked in the past to put them on the wall but make them feel like a crowd," Dewey - Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted it to be perceived as a mass movement shaped by Chelsea, which is like the movement behind his liberation," he said.
Northwestern Education Officer and Oxford University employee wanted for murder
A nationwide manhunt has been launched for a Northwestern University educator and Oxford University employee who is wanted as a suspect after being stabbed to death by a man on a luxury apartment floor in Chongqing, police said.
Cook administration district records show that on Monday, arrest museums were issued for first-degree murder without bail for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the murder of Trenton H. James Cornell - Duranleau.
Cornell - Duranleau (26) died after being stabbed several times, the documents say.
A warning issued by the Chongqing police department said a body was found on 27 July.
Officers received a phone call, reached the Grand Plaza apartment building and found the victim with a lot of deep cut in her body.
Official sources said it was announced that Cornell - Duranleau died at the scene, and that police were actively searching for the two suspects while detectives were investigating the stabbing as a murder.
Lathem has been an associate professor at Northwestern University in microbiology and immunology since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of university relations, said in an email statement that lathemat was on administrative leave and was barred from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal case that is under investigation by the necessary authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior finance assistant at Oxford University.
"We are in touch with United Kingdom police and are ready to assist us investigative authorities in any way they need," a university and Somerville University spokesman said in an email.
The statement also said Warren's colleagues were in shock and asked him to turn himself in.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of communications at the Chongqing Police Department, said he strongly encouraged the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of where they are but our efforts in identifying him are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police had received a phone call from the Grand Plaza building manager, who had just received a mysterious clue that something had happened in the 1008 - pound apartment.
Police described the scene as terrible.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident was also on 27 July.
Lathem and Warren were in the building, he said, and were confirmed by security cameras.
"We believe the victim had a relationship with Professor Latham," Guglielmi said.
The management staff at the Grand Plaza issued a statement saying to residents: "Police are still working out the victim's timeline and background and are investigating a number of samples, possibly a family incident."
Italy seizes German ship
Italian police said the vessel, called Iuventa, which is carrying out search and rescue of asylum seekers in the central Mediterranean, was seized yesterday on the island of Lampedusa.

The organization subsequently said its priorities would continue to be to save human lives, adding that they were considering the charges against them.

Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will complete the WADA road map in the short term"
Vitaly Mutko, the Russian prime minister, said it would not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for Russia's Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) to become resilient.
"A certain universe has been completed in meeting the road map criteria, RUSADA has obtained the right to plan and test in collaboration with UKAD (United Kingdom Anti-Doping).
The WADA road map has been updated in this context, "Mutko said Thursday.
The Prime Minister was assessing the second part of the WADA regulation compliance roadmap, which recently published on the institution's website, scanning the criteria governing RUSADA's resettlement.
According to Mutko, this does not include anything to worry about Russia.
"Everything is announced, all will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future, "he added.
However, it is a criterion mentioned in the list; Russia has to publicly accept the reported results of a state-sponsored doping investigation into alleged Russian sports by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which was approved by WADA.
Mutko referred to the issue, saying: "While our anti-doping system accepts a failure, we are carrying out the investigation.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no state program and we will not accept something that does not exist. "
Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov ', head of Russia's Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Speaking to Russian broadcaster RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov acknowledged his past problems with Russian anti-doping bodies, but added: "We have said at many opportunities that the report contains positions and regulations that are counter-productive.
No one is considering accepting the report unconditionally, "Smirnov added.
RUSADA's conduct of doping checks inside Russia at the height of the doping scandal in November 2005 was suspended by WADA.
However, this June test planning and coordination was allowed under the supervision of international experts and the United Kingdom Anti-Doping (UKAD).
In July, after a visit to the institution's headquarters in Moscow, WADA director Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" to make it work again.

start-ups that will help your company not be the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to gauge employee happiness at the e-commerce start - up, but the polls didn't work.
The answers were usually unclear, unhelpful or, worse, deceptive.
Some employees, even if anonymously committed, did not trust the process.
Errett, who runs Madison Reed, a 75-person e - commerce company focused on hair care in San Francisco, "has never had consistency or objectivity," he says.
He called someone from outside for help.
A new type of human resources start-up is emerging to help companies understand how their employees feel.
They are producing and licensing a software whose specialized purpose is to gauge employee legitimacy, allowing firms to conduct chip - option surveys, targeting certain teams and demographic groups, offering employees anonymisation and complaint relief lines and, in some cases, baying the top executives and announcing a discharge to the board of directors.
"There are now tools that monitor your health, such as Strava and Fitbit, but where is your company's Fitbit?" said Jim Barnett, Glint's founding partner and president of Redwood City start-up, whose software analysis tools measure the legitimacy of employees by companies.
Using Glint, Errett says he better understands what his employees think and feel after three years.
It offers teams a heartbeat map of which parts of the company have received the most complaints and which manager has low favorability scores, so that their reasons can be dashed.
In order not to be the next Uber, companies are starting to understand that they need to know about the culture of the workplace; Uber has been in a scandal since a former employee published a blog post saying publicly what he thinks is punishing harassment.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for oversight means a very profitable business opportunity.
The global management, regulation and compliance industry could be worth $118.7 billion by 2020, according to Financial Technology Insight website Let's Talk PayPal.
Interest in the Denver Colorado-based start - up Conversion Center, which helps companies identify and block bad behaviour, and the event grew amid controversy over Uber's disreputation earlier this year.
Convercentre has close to 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to make personalized "Nablus" absences, collect real-time hidden answers and issue heat maps of problem areas.
It also offers a help line that can be taken anonymously, where employees are able to report bad behaviour.
If the chairman is charged, the complaints go to the board of directors as direct.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of covercentre, said: "The court of public opinion has taken on regulators."
Quinlan said: if a company treats its employees poorly or does not act ethically, it could face costly consequences for consumer boycotts, employee weaknesses or lawsuits, even if regulators do not step in.
Restaurant chain Ruby Tuesday, which has more than 25,000 employees in 500 positions, has been using the convercentre for more than a year to make its employees aware of principles and procedures and offer easy access to the company Center.
When an employee previously wanted to report a problem, he had to find a phone number or email belonging to the company Center, make a formal complaint and hope it would be taken seriously.
James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAY'S chief legal officer, said these were often eye-catching and disturbing experiences, not a good way to track employee complaints.
But now that the company is using convercentre, problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair pay (previously hidden from managers sitting in offices, city or county distance) can be detected and resolved more quickly.
Vitrano, who runs Ruby TUESDAY'S risk management group, said: "I can approach this employment experience with a holistic, 360-degree view."
"In addition, we protect our shareholders against business lawsuits."
After accounting firm Arthur Andersen sank in 2002 over a breach of ethical values stemming from the Enron scandal, companies took ethics, values and relationship with the employee more seriously in 2002, Quinlan said.
But after "social media came into its own," the firms realised they could not prevent their dirty washes from becoming viral.
"Before technology was used to oversee ethics, people were using hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service and receive repeated fees for the use of their products.
This is a business model and opportunity with the approval of risk capital investors who support both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 m in branch financing from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total Capital to $47 m.
Glint provided $10 m in tape from Bessemer Venture Partners and increased its total financing to $60 m.
These investments do not come as much of a surprise, given the nature, cultures and risk capital of companies that depend on each other.
Increasing amounts of research shows that today's employees expect more from the workplace than before.
High wages and interesting projects in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are only minimal requirements.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted, that they are valued and that they are giving their time to a company that has a positive mission.
Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint, said: "When people are happy to be in a company, when they feel their voices are being heard, and the work they do, they are more introverted to make that company successful."
Investors will profit when their own portfolio companies are doing a good job; companies will do a good job if they hire employees and feel owned by the company.
If third party analytics tools are designed to increase employee sentiment and feeling of belonging, it is not surprising that they find support.
Having data on employee commitment is important according to workplace culture experts.
But the data does not work if those responsible for the company do not act.
In fact, a company can create an expectation that change is coming if it wants feedback from its employees.
And if the expectation doesn't come fast enough, or if it doesn't come at all, it can cause disappointment and make employees feel like they have been cut off.
"If you're going to ask for 4000 proposals, you need to be ready to talk 4000," said Russell Raath, who is head of consulting at business management firm Kotter International and has seen firms make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow, employees will think, 'Is it really appealing to me?
Don't care?
And if they don't care about you, why don't they care about me? '
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to act on the same day when a problem was reported in Glint.
And after collecting feedback from employees who were fed up with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganise various teams within the company and add communication training to solve problems.
In Ruby tuesdayi, the company is getting new insight into its own employees and hopes that in the long term, this will translate into being able to hire more workers in such an industry, which is known to have a high number of employee entrances.
Vitrona said: "If you are not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you lose people."
'And if you lose people, you're going to lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you're going to lose firms, "he said.
Still, she says, this is an important step towards modernity.

It's a long day for Bruins as the NCAA removes two trains every day.
The clock is ticking at 11 p.m., and a güruh of UCLA football players are stuck on one side of the team's new training ground inside the campus.
Some have exposed the superiority of their form, worrying about the terrain of the first day at training camp.
For an important part of the team, these empty minutes are a mid-day break.
After 3 hours of training, players enrolled in summer classes will return home and work their final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Centre for meetings at 6.30 the next morning.
Just before returning to the hall Monday, Bruins coach Jim Mora said: "The next three days are an episode for these guys."
Held to lift the burden on the players, the NCAA removed two training sessions a day, at least until the final Friday, essentially extending their day.
So UCLA's first three training sessions were programmed to start at 7.15 p.m. to adjust to the players' already tight schedule.
The reason for the absence of two trains a day is mainly a training session; Bruins is taking the start of camp close to a week from last season, and training at the summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons at Westwood.
They plan to train 18 by August 20 before starting their official game preparations for their opening against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said the NCAA supports the rule change, even though it has added new items to the players' intensive work program.
Mora said: "We put a huge burden on them for three or four days and it is very challenging."
'And they've gone through it recently; they're working, they're amazing kids.
I think we will have more time when we come to Cumbria, it will be really amazing. ""
UCLA will stop training when the camp is over; the luxury hotel Luskin Centre, which sits next to the parking and bypass soccer ball and closes the fortress with a protective network, is no easy task given that its pitches are on the line of view.
Bruins' players are scheduled to settle in the hotel from the start of this week, but Mora admits there may be a problem with the evacuation of those rooms during the season.
"We will have security," Mora said.
"It's a real concern and it's not too flashy to think that someone will rent a room and sit there and videotape a training session.
If there is a video of a training session, it is a good one for baya.
But we will have security there and we will have security in the above Parking Lot 8.
We will do our best with what we have.
I'm not going to worry too much about it.
We have a plan. "

Facebook increases story confirmation power to fight against fake news
Facebook will send more potential fake articles to third party story verifiers and show their findings below the original sharing; this is how the world's largest online social network tried to combat what it called fake news on Thursday.
In a statement on its website, the firm said they would use updated machine learning to identify possible frauds and send them to story verifiers, potentially showing story confirmation results below the original article.
Facebook has been criticised for being one of the main distribution points for what many know as fake news, which many think influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The issue has also turned into a major political headache in Europe, with French voters bracing for a flood of fake news before the presidential election in May and Germany backing a plan to cut fines if they fail to quickly remove hate-filled sharing on social media networks in the run-up to elections there.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new story verification feature is being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
Sara Su, product manager at Facebook news flow, said in a blog: "In addition to seeing what stories are being discussed by third party story verifiers, people want more resources about what they read and share in order to make decisions based on information."
Facebook will continue to test the "relevant article" feature and will work on other changes in the flow of news to reduce fake news, he added.

Creating a cartoon: the Story of a fortress in Britain
In his recent past, he was involved in the fortress of Scotney, a Squeeze of music, and was a refuge for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But right now, Scotney, who inspired a cartoon novel written by Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshireman passionate about swearing-in, historical documents, has personified 700 years of turbulent history in the city from his comfortable seat in the Bewl River Valley.
"I find it very nice to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says effusively.
"How is it a personal bond to keep this letter in my hands," he said.
A fortress in the UK, from the Edward takeover to the Middle Ages, each story belonged to a different artist named after the United Kingdom (Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg) and their families who lived in Scotney to be depicted.
This is not Rhodes's first book, based on an archive: he also wrote the diaries and other stories of the dead men in 2014, a project he found unexpectedly emotional, inspired by stories in the British Library.
"My eyes were even fingerprinted on the edge of a letter written in the 1700 s by a dual agent working for King James fans," he says.
"It was a trace of his head finger!
The letters always smell of is because you lit a fire for the light at the time.
For someone in the future of 300 years, the smell felt like it was there.
Ah, I'm in the archives! "
As someone who falls in love with the old papers, getting support from the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and staying for almost four months in a fortress ("I honestly overcame my warm welcome") seems too good.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the "new" fortress from the Victorian era, scanning archives and working out a range of treasures and antiquities, such as backpacks and bottles that had spent centuries on the walls of the property.
He spoke with choreographers, gardeners and sometimes artists working on the illustrations of his book, circulating the territory and ruins of the old fortress.
Then at night, he would "drink visuals and put it in writing."
The National Trust will only be able to access full access when the late heir Elizabeth Hussey died in 2006, so Scotney's desired history is unknown.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, staff only began to take up the archive, saying: "For centuries, annual aristocrats were saying: 'Oh, it's a horse among the ceiling."
The diaries, letters from the days of the British Empire, maps setting out the limits of who owns what: "You would think that territorial disputes would be boring," Rhodes said, "but there was a hush tree that the two families were fighting over.
Empty-handed, guys! "
Some stories in the collection, including The Labourer who left the newly built fortress to join the peasant inquiry in 1381, use the fortress as a jumping-off point for a broader entry into British history.
"There is a record in this book of the Knights families of the city and Sussex that there was a rebellion in the 1380 s in the fortress," Rhodes said.
"The peasant skirmish started around this and I thought," a rebellion can be a good starting point.
Maybe the two are connected? "
Other stories are tightly linked to the history of the fortress, for example, The Priest, which tells the story of The Darrell family, who spent 7 years hiding a Cizvit pony during The British Isles.
Or The Smuggler, which includes 18th-century Smuggler Arthut Darrell, who is thought to have filled a coffin with stones and staged his own funeral (a disclosure made years later when his coffin was removed from the land).
Darrells Rhodes's most eye-catching Scotney family said: "These brains seem to be quite streetwise, they always go into debt and spend money on things they can't afford.
In different generations, Darrell men have solved their debt crises by marrying wealthy elderly women; I imagine them as a group of awesome men, who have a reputation for cooking for female heirs. "
Rhodes, whose job in the fortress is to search for other texting experiences.
In the Finnish wilderness, at the beginning of the 20th century, he completed a two-week job for a cartoon about elänmäki, which has since been recreated by nature.
But Scotney holds a separate place in his glory.
"I was sorry I left," she said.
"I thought: 'Oh, I have to go now and face the possible real life of lane. '"
Bulgarian nurses Kristiana Vulcheva, Nasya Nenova, Snezhana Dimitrova, Valentina Siropulo and Valya chervenyaska, and Palestinian doctor Ashraf Friday Hajuj, who were granted Bulgarian citizenship in the days before, were evacuated early on Tuesday after hours of intense talks between a European delegation and Libyan authorities.

'Maho' reaction to Meral Akşener
İsmet Büyükataman, general secretary of the Nationalist Movement Party, issued a written statement on social media and media claims about the MHP in recent days.
Büyükataman said that from social media and "some corners of old rifle markers" had been "kindly flowing" into MHP, saying that "plays and manifestations have been applied to prevent the nationalist movement from continuing to exist under the MHP after 12 September."

Now we will disrupt the games, we will scare the players.
"The patent of statelessness is in the MHP," Büyükataman said, implying Meral Akşener. "I will take Maho villagers to Germany, like a former Yeshiva - made Banker Bilo film, how to go after days of walking in the truck tape, how to go after a mountain climb of İstanbul, how to go to power."
It is a matter for them, but our only desire from these patrons is that they become the newcomers to where they go.

Washington changes Green Card rules
Media quoted President Donald Trump as saying there would be a new US immigrant plan that changes the Green Card rules.

The draft law will be debated in both branches of Congress.
"This law will reduce the poor, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and do so by changing the way the United States gives Green cards to other country citizens.

This new application process will benefit English-speaking candidates, those with self-sufficiency financial resources and talents that will benefit our economy, "Trump said, as quoted by American media.
The Turkish Language Institution has reached its twenty-seventh edition of the writing guide with work by the up-to-date Turkish Dictionary and writing manual Working Group.
Let me just point out, there has been no change to the rules that have been put in place in this repression, in order to bring the rules of writing to permanent status, to eradicate, so as to achieve unity in the writing.
The principle of meeting the middle way in writing, based on traditionalised forms of writing in the guide published by the Turkish Language Institution in 1996, was also observed in this suppression.
This suppression of the writing manual was co-authored with the latest edition of the Turkish Dictionary, new problems with writing as a result of developments in the language were attributed to a rule, issues that could not be addressed in previous prescriptions.
The up-to-date Turkish Dictionary and writing guide working group has considered the frequency of use with the principle that writing is a habit and tradition when reviewing hundreds of examples of each rule.
Despite some problems with the Latin Turkish article, which we have been using for more than eighty years, we can now say that my writing has become tradition.
Undoubtedly, the work of the Turkish language institution, which has reached eighty years, plays an important role.
In our country, the task of drafting, writing and publishing the manual of writing has been given to the Turkish Language Institution under Article 664 of Article 10 of the decree, which is based on Article 134 of the Constitution.
Since its inception, the Turkish Language Institution has been trying to fulfill its duty in determining the rules of writing and publishing the manual of writing.
The Turkish Language Institution's up-to-date Turkish-language dictionary and writing guide Working Group has stood tentatively above every software, with the principle of ending debates in writing and promoting the rules and forms of writing that everyone will embrace, use and write.
Writers interpret Fenerbahçe - Sturm Graz match
It was caddie that I couldn't find for two seasons, the euphoria I couldn't see, and the visualization again...
Aykut Kocaman's "mangal Reynolds" team was on the pitch to make the "stand between us" deal with his fan.
We can bring criticism to his game, positions or performances, but I haven't watched such a functioning and searching game for a long time.
He made it clear in the first game, but yesterday he had his own Instagram shoulder; Fenerbahçe's commander on the field is now Valbuena.
When he was transferred, his age was a problem, but in my husband's words, there was the phrase "character who didn't give up."
30 years ago, we gave the name of the atomic Carpenter to consent.
If he copes, it will be the most awesome comment to the French player.
He was everywhere in the field, joining all the pass organizers, always taking responsibility and scoring a goal, putting a huge show on the short lap.
Alper's front-runner left Sturm Graz "restricted" in his field for a long time to stay in his second striker position.
Fenerbahçe sought constant formula to overcome such a harsh wall while closing the circuit without corner throwing a winner.
They dominate the ball, but they do not produce effective passes in any competing penalty area.
It may bring the "striker lazy" interpretation, but we are facing the game that is hesitant to pass on to ahmethane, unable to put the only striker in position.
Either the team didn't trust the young player or his performance needs to develop a bit more.
After the score was 1-1, they didn't take advantage of two clear opportunities.
It was important for them to go through the tour, but it would have been more beauty on the night to put this fan "scoring" on a standing ovation for the players' fight.
Another 1-2 transfer would probably come by the time of the draw.
But the fact is that Fenerbahçe's biggest need is number 12...
We are on the verge of a very light-hearted and enjoyable season with this style of play that carries the heart of those in the stands trying to play the front.
Aykut Kocaman's machine is setting up his ground, he needs a bit more time.
Physics are good as quality.
The quality of play will develop.
You also see very clearly that the self-confidence of all the players on the field is growing.
They very much need yesterday's gentle applause for a new chapter.
The rise of sex robots is real and we should be concerned
A new report on technological developments in the sex robot industry as you think full 2017 cannot be even more strange.
Yes.
Sex robots are a big event at the moment.
Recently, the responsible Robot science institution (FRR) published a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, a retired professor of robot science and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we should take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye-catching, meticulous shape and the type of truck.
Speaking about the release of the new report, Mr Sharkey said: "People are giving them a continental laugh but the firms are actually enjoying it and we will see them even more."
Modern sex babies evolved into robots with particular human-like reactions, carried out by artificial intelligence, with silicon compression, which is hot to touch from the likes of which can be inflated.
Users can also choose everything from the robot's eye color, meticulous shape, to the type or color of the truck, to personalize their robot to fit their own blood.
But with so many robots having "personalities" to innovate a Stepford woman, this is even more disturbing.
Modern sex babies evolved into silicon - derived robots.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to personalize their own robots according to their character characteristics (for example, they find it attractive).
Then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, which come with pre-programmed personalities, including "Frijit Farrah" and "Wild Wendy" with his "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that fits your personality as much as possible," True company's website exclaims.
So whatever you like about it, what you don't like about it, what you don't like about it, etc.
They also have mood throughout the day, like the same real people.
He can be sleepy, he can be willing to talk, or he can be "in full fashion."
There are many disturbing sides to the rise of sex robots: not only the replacement of genuine humanitarian relations, but their overly obedient female personalities, the rapacious connotations approaching Frijit Farah are the thinnest.
On its website, True Companion compares Roxxxy to a vibrator, but it's for men.
"If a woman can be a vibrator (as is the case with the text), why shouldn't men also have Roxxxy?" the website says.
However, these sex robots are not just a conquest or sex toys.
Their emergence and growing complexity point to something more dark and deep within our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to the desire for sex through painstaking, optional eclecticism.
Many men will not naturally possess sex robots, and the FRR points to their growing popularity, but for now they are on the outskirts of consumer culture.
But leaking from the flesh can be highly instructive about the course of the period we are living in.
Many people are not strange or aggressive until the free market gives them the right to be.
It is little coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots have emerged at a time when women's rights are under threat worldwide, with a speaker in the white house boasting of sexual assault on women.
The most chilling side of The Handmaid's Tale TV series is not the depictions, illuminated bodies or oyster eyes that show all the details, but how realistic it feels.
The Republic of Gilead is a sudden change, but it doesn't feel like much has changed at the moment.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create as much physical similarity as possible to real women (at the rates of, of course, porn film stars) as technologically possible.
Their creators want them to make sense of people when they touch, and for them to imitate the movements of a real body.
But when it comes to their "personalities," robots clearly cannot represent real women.
They can't leave their wives or leave them.
They have no activities or past stories, nothing to reveal their independence or disrupt the total slave fantasy.
In other words, they are joyous slaves.
Or, in the words of 2017: carols.
Attack on US military convoy: there are dead and wounded...
A suicide attack in the Karabakh district of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, targeted foreign military forces operating in the country.
Among the wounded in the blast, which killed 1 NATO soldier and 3 civilians, 5 "of the wounded" were American soldiers in the convoy and 1 "were interpreters working with NATO forces.
An official statement by NATO Support forces in Afghanistan (Resolute Support) said NATO forces landed the suicide bomber's homemade explosive device during a joint patrol with the Afghan National Army.
The injured personnel were being treated at Bagram Airport American military hospital.
There is no vital danger to the injured.
Local media said the suicide bomber was a member of the Taliban.
Trump's great sanctuary?
To show Mitt Romney like a timer of common sense
It was the reality of the Trump era that polarized US voters, the political divide dividing families on a micro-scale.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving Day, newspapers in the United States were filled with how to deal with the nightmare of relatives who voted for Trump.
We are all making an effort to detonate our own filtration balloons into the dictionary.
Less talked about is Trump's power to bring families together.
I am referring to this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chongqing and is intertwined with Republicans in our family, is visiting us in New York this week.
It reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Anyone familiar with Trump's establishment in the White House, including his Republican brother, who has been mundane about policy for decades, is on the same side, in one and strange way.
At the dinner table, of course, this is a good thing, but it seems to me that it carries significant risks in a broad context.
The left was invigorated by Trump, but the influence of his presidency created the power of pushback to the right for all of me.
When we talk about "normalisation" and Trump, we talk about the terrible likelihood that one day his abusive behaviour may no longer be a joke.
There is even a more frightening long-term scenario, in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who oppose his own standards, and they seem to be a symbol of logic at once.
I find myself experiencing nostalgia about the hasty version of Mitt Romney's madness: the dog in the car's ceiling, 14% Income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looks like), both of which, according to Trump, are indeed very light crimes.
When Trump goes, the next Republican candidate must only be at the forefront of his mind to assess that he has achieved immeasurable degree of development.
When my cousin was in the city, we took our children to the attic in Central Park, the largest of the Atlas operated by the New York parks department, and the three best papers you can spend in the city if you don't need a cafe.
The horses are huge, the central silhouette fiberglas designs (palyacho, all of which make strange surprises, and the animals returned to look at them with fear behind their own shoulders), and the music rushing through the tunnel.
In other words, many clichés of a city can be disappointing: the landscapes of high buildings are starting to get boring, the horizon line is starting to become too familiar to create too much excitement, and the reality of the city is not reaching its peak.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I still haven't been able to completely overcome the day when I discovered that the Swiss Cottage was, in fact, not a Swiss Cottage (the themed bar Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is a vast crossroads in north London).
But it's still a strange magical experience when you're in Central Park, two people in their twenties, one in their 11 s and two women in their 40s can go there and all have a very good time.
If I could give him a note, I would give him a full grade, but thankfully no one asked.
On the other hand, I was asked to assess my transaction "experience" between 1 and 5 stars before passing my credit card in a bonanza this week.
It's the same at the coffee shop on the corner of my street, the option of matching the note with a 15% garment; for what is purchased from the scheme...
The effect is not only that it slows down what should be a neutral exchange, but that it puts pressure on the presenter to bring personality to an event that is never needed.
As the woman from Zaval in bonmarsh lined up as a standing apology, frustrated, I gave five stars my experience of giving her a credit card.
When the temperature exceeded 41 degrees, they wore monkeys
In Tunceli, the scene of one of the hottest days of the season, people flocked to Munzur beaches.
Young, children, elderly, women and men who entered the beaches on the outskirts of Munzur, as the Heat pushed through the afternoon, tried to protect themselves from the heat by blowing up in the ice water.
Beaches on the edge of the "Munzur tea," especially as TUNCELLI citizens living in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, France and the UK spend their holidays in their home countries rather than in the Aegean or the Mediterranean.
Suna Tosun, who was among those who swiped at Munzur Beach, said she favoured Tunceli instead of western provinces for the holiday, adding, "it was more true to stay in our own land, to be stuck in ailment Munzur, where I didn't want to spend my holiday in the West."
"Munzur's ice water is nowhere in the world, Munzur in these temperatures makes us cool," he said.
Hasan Ulu, from Germany, said they preferred the Munzur tea coast in Tunceli instead of the fountain or Bodrum beaches, so they had no regrets.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital with breast pain
This is the second time Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to hospital for treatment of sniffles in his puzzles, which prison officials said occurred after he fell in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors against the previous accidental manslaughter decision.
In the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013, he killed Steenkamp at his home in Pretoria by firing several times towards the door of a toilet cabin.
Pistorius had claimed to have confused his girlfriend with someone who entered the nighttime without an invitation, hiding in the cabin.
Prosecutors said they intend to appeal once again against Pistorius's six-year sentence, which they think is too lenient this time.
The National Prosecuting body has said it will appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court, and the appeal could be considered later this year.
Pistorius will face up to 15 years of his sentence if prosecutors succeed.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
So at the cost of damaging regional stability, he is trying to put his own interest in the interests of the alliance.
Last Friday, a Romanian convoy with a Ukrainian - flagged sanctuary ran aground near the port of Silistre in Eastern Bulgaria, blocking traffic.

Maybe what we need is to completely remove the witness families or put the witnesses under the full breath of the police, "he said.
For example, about 5,000 young protesters who participated in Thursday's (September 1st) "opening" mobilization marched through central Athens.

His last words were 'San I am dead, goodbye mother
Among those killed in the Grenfell Tower fire in London, which has so far been said to be 30, the fire instantly called his mother, saying, "I don't want to die, it's not fair at all."
"Thank you for everything that he did for me, goodbye," said Italian Gloria Trevisan, "and his loved one."
Among the scores of people who could not be heard in the aftermath of the fire were Gloria Trevisan, 26, who was sitting on the 23 "celebrities" of the 24-story building, and Marco Gottardi, an Italian lovemaker.
Maria Cristina Sandri, a lawyer for the Trevisan family in northern Italy, announced in a statement that the two teenagers also lost their lives, according to information from British competents.
Noting that young people's families are experiencing great pain, the lawyer also asked journalists not to insist on getting an explanation.
I think I'm dead, goodbye mother
Lawyer Sandri said Gloria called her mother, Emanuela Trevisan, "on her mobile phone shortly after the fire broke out, and she cried when she listened to these latest conversations recorded by the mother.
Accordingly, Gloria Trevisan spoke with her mother a few times during the 2 hours after the fire, which started around 01.00 local time.
Trevisan, who was quieter in his first speeches, said, "mother, bad things happen here, there's a fire."
We are trapped, we can't go outside.
There is a little bit of smoke, but we are worried, waiting to be saved.
"We tried to get out by opening the door, but there was a lot of smoke and the lift wasn't working," he was quoted as saying.
Gloria Trevisan, whose anxiety grew in the aftermath of the fire, was quoted as saying:
Mother, I've been through my eyes all my life.
I think I'm dead.
I've got a life to live in; it's not fair at all.
I don't want to die and I want to help you financially.
I'm sorry I won't be able to embrace you again.
Thank you for everything that has been done for me, goodbye mother.
I'm going to heaven now and I'm going to help you from there.
This is the fault of the Italian government
Gloria Trevisan and Her sister Marco Gottardi, who both studied architecture, moved to London in March from the Veneto region in the north of the country after graduating last year.
Gloria Trevisan, who had only been able to find a 300-euro paid job in her home country, soon started working in London at a job that cost 1,800 pounds (about 2060 euros).
Lawyer Sandri said the family of Gloria Trevisan "had a difficult time financially," adding, "Gloria had traveled to London to help her family."
Unfortunately, our young people are forced to leave the country to save their future and find work.
"The government should address this problem immediately," he said.
Italy's drama of failing to provide jobs for its young
Gloria's father, Loris Trevisan, expressed outrage, saying, "this is the fault of our government, which has forced our young people to flee abroad to find work."
In Italy, the unemployment rate has reached 12% "while among young people it is 40%."
On the rise this problem has prompted many Italian young people to emigrate to many European countries over the past few years, particularly the UK.
Last year alone, the number of young people forced to leave Italy because of unemployment exceeded 110,000.
Commenting on the certainty of reports of the deaths of Gloria Trevisan and Marco Gottardi, the Italian press also said it was a drama of a country failing to provide jobs for its young people.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could ease İBH
Red meat and chocolate can be a nightmare for your nervous system.
But a new study claims the opposite: a rich nutrition from meat-based protein and dairy products can help alleviate the symptoms of those who suffer from the illness if we bind to medication.
This untreatable health condition, which affects 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes mide Kramps and bottlenecks, repeated or bloody ishale, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Although patients are usually advised to throw meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that the protein-based aminoasidi triptophone helps develop immune cells that develop a durable binge.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna said the immune cells patrolled the intestines so that the microbes hiding in the food did not secretly enter the body.
Cells that are muddled to trigger illness are balanced with cells that encourage endurance by preserving sensitive tissues without causing damage.
If the balance shifts virtually towards medication, it can be caused by illness if we bind.
Experiments have found a form of immune cell that encourages resilience in mice carrying a specialized bacteria in their intestines.
And bacteria need triptofana, one of the protein's building stones, to trigger the emergence of cells.
Professor Colonna said: 'we have established a link between the bacterial type Lactobacillus reuteri, which is part of the microbiome, and the development of cell poppy, which encourages resilience. '
Mice, who were more triptofan in their nutrition, had more of these immune cells. '
If the same thing happens in humans, L. reuteri and triptofan said, rich nutrition can develop the environment if we are more durable, less lethal.
Dr. Luisa Cervantes - barraganis, a post-doctoral researcher, has discovered that while working on a type of immune cell that improves resilience, a group of experimental mice have such cells, but are of the same kind and are kept in a different location.
He suspected that the difference was related to the bacteria, viruses and mushrooms that live in the mide - and - mix channel, in other words, with the microbiome of the mice.
DNA seizures of the intestines of the mice were done, and it was found that there were six bacterial species in the mice with immune cells, but they were not.
Mice who lacked a binge microbiome and did not develop such an immune cell were given L. reuteri and immune cells as they were seen in a sterile environment.
To understand how the bacteria affects the immune system, researchers grew L. Reuteri in liquid and then transferred small amounts of this liquid, which is bacterial to unmatched immune cells from mice.
Immune cells have become cells that encourage durability.
The active component was found to be a byproduct of triptofan metabolism, known as indol-3-laktic assay, when it was purified from liquid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of triptofan in the nutrients of the mice, the number of cells increased by about 50%, but when triptofan levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr. Cervantes - Barragan said people have cells that encourage the same durability as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in the mide - and - shine channel.
It is not known whether triptofan byproducts from L. Reuteri develop in humans as they do in mice, but disorders in the genes that are related to triptophone have been found in people with the illness.
"The development of these cells is something we probably want to encourage because these cells control the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially, in cases where L. Reuteri is present, high level triptofan causes the spread of this poppy. "
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United have signed a'dahiye' with Nemanja Matic
After the midfielder made his first appearance against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening, Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed an "internship" with Nemanja Matic.
The £40 m transfer from Chelsea began with a 2-1 win in Dublin ahead of the UEFA Süper Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday in UNITED'S last pre-season match, and took a dim view of the fact that Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were in the position to hold forward according to their joys.
However, there was a serious shortage of match-fixing by the Mavericks, who were ruled out in the pre-season Asian tour, and were able to take only 45 minutes; Mourinho admitted that it had to be improved before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his intellect, his horror of thinking... he thinks about football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him to be ready sooner," he said.
Mourinho began to give shape to his first 11 for the start of the season, while, like Matic, his new transfer friends Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also made it to the game at the Aviva Stud.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted another 3 transfers but insisted the club had already done an "extraordinary job" by carrying out three of his four priority transfers.
"I thank the club for taking three of the four yesterday," he added.
"I would be happier if they got four out of four, but they made a lot of effort for me," he said.

White House demonstration cost taxpayers thousands
According to military records released to TIME, the White House's decision last month to fly a Marine helicopter to the southern grasslands for an organization that promotes American production cost taxpayers up to $24,000.
When he was chairman, the green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One, was the focus of interest in the organization that promoted the July 17 American building programs at the White House.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officers toured products produced in all 50 counties.
The helicopter, made in Connecticut, was displayed side by side with a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklifter from Mississippi.
According to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron one (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the Helicopter; the White House Military Department requested the availability of the Helicopter in an isolated order (FRAGO da) just 36 hours before the Helicopter landed in southern Chongqing for the "unusual" event.
The commander of HMX-1 sent an e-mail to the Marine Corps Aviation Commander, who is superior, a day before the organization said, "I just wanted to make sure you are aware because this is an extraordinarily high-visibility organization."
The message said the helicopter would arrive in the southern cement for the event at around 7 pm on the morning of 17 July and stay there until the tent is cleared between 6 pm and 9 pm.
The note added that if an exit from the White House is delayed, a second flight team will be required for the return flight because of the time limits.
Unit security personnel were on the ground carrying air, while the original flight crew was in a helicopter during the event.
It is unclear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required from the records that were secured to time.
Hatch law prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records show HMX-1 is investigating whether the organization breached the requirement.
"A question we asked was whether he violated the Hatch Act, and it was reported that he did not," the commander wrote.
"It seems like you've got a mass," replied the acting commander.
The "make in America" organization is designated by the White House as an official organization and does not fall under Hatch law.
But even official organizers have political instincts.
In the organization, he then touched on ongoing health service reform efforts in the Senate and praised efforts to rein in government regulation.
Using Air conditioners, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Heads have to use them to travel.
But it is unusual for them to be formally asked to use only for the opportunity to take a photo.
Trump took note when he advanced to the stage of his first campaign rally in February in Melbourne Florida, where his Twitter account was filled with messages about the use of his predecessor's presidential plane.
Lindsay Walters, deputy White House press spokesman, said: "The White House is excited about the 'Made in America' exhibition, where there are products made with American materials by American workers from all 50 counties."
The HMX-1 crew often carries out training flights in the Washington area and exercises in southern Chongqing to leave the US president with a spot on the White House.
Trump was in Germany for the G-20 summit in early July, while HMX-1 carried out 58 exercise lanes at the White House.
An official said the flight, which was for the organization of Made in America, was counted on the air crew's need for training inside that month.
Unit helicopters flew for an additional 11 hours that day for "support tasks that are not related to the Presidency."
The White House said taxpayers did not take a burden on any other numbers involved in the organization.
A spokesman for sikorksky said his firms were not involved in arranging for the helicopter to be displayed in southern Chongqing.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights, and the exact cost incurred by the Organization is difficult to detect.
But according to the Ministry of Defense's hour-long rates for the 2017 fiscal year, the Defense Department's rate of meeting the VH-3D is $24,340 per flight hour.
Unit records record the airline's flight time as 30 minutes from its central base in Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico Virginia to both sides.
The White House claims that the actual operating cost of the helicopter is well below that rate.
"It is very misleading for taxpayers to put a cost-of-living estimate on base," Walters said.
"These rate projections cover staff, maintenance and subdued costs, which include annual costs."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the Ministry of Defense's cost-cutting rates do not include staff costs but fuel, maintenance and contraception costs.
Back then, Sean Spicer, a former White House press spokesman, advocated using the helicopter for that organization.
"Here's what anafikir did in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know Sikorsky and Connecticut County are very proud of their contribution to our national security, and zannedii is very proud of the work of hundreds of people, even if they are not thousands.
And I think we are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment that many Americans, like most Americans, work tirelessly to make.
So, of course, it is appropriate to put it that way. "
It is not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter while walking the southern grass for the event, but he stepped into the driver's seat of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump joked about the media and company products in his fleet, addressing Sikorsky representatives.
"I know Sikorsky very well," he said, "I have 3 of them in me."
