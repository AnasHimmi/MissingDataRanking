Last minute: Cosmic visitor giant asteroid 2014 jo25
The solar system has billions, perhaps more giant meteorites, circulating adrift and causing serious consequences when it hits.
The path of these objects, which may have closed or open orbit from the formation of the sun, can sometimes pass through the Earth.
The 650-metre-wide asteroid 2014 jo25 will pass by 1.75 million km away, a visitor like this and the closest location to earth today at 14:24 AM.
We've become more and more aware of this kind of news every day.
The most important reason for this is observation techniques and developments in observation instruments.
In this way, we have the opportunity to determine asteroids of a smaller size that could not be determined before.
Last January, for example, a bus-sized asteroid traveled only half the distance of the Earth and the moon (~250,000 km).
And even more interesting, the asteroid was detected only a few days before the transition.
So there could be other cosmic buses coming up on us right now.
Imagine if you heard that a 20-foot asteroid would fall into the middle of your neighborhood, what would you do?
In fact, asteroids of this size will destroy your neighborhood, but probably all the buildings will be blown up.
This will be due to shock waves emitted from asteroid that will explode in the atmosphere.
For example, in 2013, the asteroid fell to Russia, and it was enough to smash the windows of buildings in several cities.
However, if you have an asteroid target of 100 meters diameter, you will be advised to go at least 50 kilometers from your local area.
Criteria such as the size of asteroid and the angle of impact are factors that determine the depth of Crater and the damage caused by the impact.
According to the European Space Agency simulation, let's look at a few scenarios.
If an asteroid with a diameter of 100 m hits the Earth at a 45-degree angle at a speed of 60 km per second, a crater with a depth of about 250 meters and a diameter of 1200 meters is formed.
According to the Richter scale, the impact is equivalent to a 6-magnitude earthquake, and even if you are 10 km away from the impact point, you will still have 3. degree burns occur.
50 km away from the window Windows will be waiting.
If an asteroid hits a 1 km radius, the situation becomes even more depressing.
If such an asteroid hits the earth with the same angle and speed, a crater is formed at a depth of about 600 meters and a diameter of 12 km.
In other words, a whole neighborhood becomes a crater and instantly disappears.
Because of the heat generated by the impact, even if you are 100 km away from the impact point, your body is 3. degree burns occur.
According to the Richter scale of the impact is equivalent to 8 magnitude earthquake.
The damage to the asteroid is not only due to the chemical composition of the asteroid, but also to the rocky structure of the region it is going to hit.
The above values are given based on the scenario in which a rock-like asteroid falls into a sedimentary rock.
If the asteroid is mostly made up of iron, the crater size will increase by 3 times if it falls to a surface formed by the cooling of the lava.
66 million years ago, something worse happened to the dinosaurs, and they were exposed to the catastrophe of a 10-kilometer asteroid impact.
Seventy-five percent of marine and terrestrial creatures were instantly destroyed by an asteroid impact.
If this massive asteroid that Destroyed the dinosaurs targeted the earth, make sure the most solid option is to leave the planet.
There are tons of matter falling on earth every day from space.
Most of them burn in the atmosphere.
Some meteors that are large enough to burn in the atmosphere, causing the populace to glow known as Starship.
Let's end our summer with another news to relieve the interior.
Studies show that for the next 300-400 years, a giant asteroid is not expected to hit Earth, causing serious devastation.
I'm sure you're relieved to have a little bit of an average living species for 70 years.

Human Rights Group issued travel notice for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of colored people has issued a warning for colored people travelling to Missouri, due to the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The Group's statement said: "Since the NAACP travel Recommendation notice in Missouri States has been valid since August 28, 2017, African-American travelers, visitors and Missouri residents have recently been suspicious, race-based events throughout the state, so as to advise them to pay special attention and be extremely cautious when travelling from the beginning to the end of the State."
NAACP said that a new Missouri law makes it difficult for people to win discrimination cases, but that disproportionately targeting minorities in the province's legal practices is effective in the group's publication of this travel warning.
"There are human rights violations that happen to people.
They're stopped, beaten and killed because of the color of their skin."Missouri NAACP President rod Chapel to Kansan City star.
"We hear complaints at the rate we have not heard before."
This is the first time the Association has issued such a warning for a state in the United States.
The Group showed examples of racist insults against black students at Missouri university and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders was arrested earlier this year for a charge by the Missouri police after he ran out of fuel as he passed through the state and died under suspicious circumstances.
The recommendation also points out a new report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office that black drivers in the province are likely to be stopped by 75 percent more than white people.
Chapel said, "the recommendation is to alert people to be awake and to warn their families, friends and colleagues that they might be in Missouri." quoth.
"People should be ready to bring bail money with them, to inform their relatives that they will pass through this state."
In Missouri, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crimes reporting program, 100 hate crimes have been committed in 2015, which ranks the state 16th in the country in terms of the number of similar violations.
The travel alert also responds to a new Missouri law, where it is more difficult to sue a workplace for discriminating while renting a residence or giving a job.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel advice for Texas and Arizona after the local enforcement authorities of these states passed immigration enforcement laws that ordered people to be arrested for immigration violations, ACLU said that this would increase practices according to the race.
Travel alerts are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently defence groups have been applying for this in response to a number of laws and trends within the United States.

Referendum out of barzan!
Barzani delivered a speech at the commemoration ceremony held in Duhok on the 3rd anniversary of the attack by the terrorist organization Deaş on the Ezidians in sincar district of Mosul.
In his speech, Barzani mentioned the Independence Referendum that the Ikb wanted to hold on September 25, and said: "I regret to say this, we have no hope that Iraq will be a proper and correct country."
We tried all the ways with Iraq, but we were completely desperate and desperate.
Past experiences with Iraq have brought us to this situation and there is no guarantee that we can take our rights and be protected.
Therefore, in order to achieve life and security together, we must show the world that we can all determine our destiny through the referendum.
I have to underline this: the referendum is not a goal for us, but a means to achieve a greater goal.
After the collapse of the Baathist regime in 2003, the Iraqi central government made many promises to Kurds, Barzani recalled, soon after the disaster in Sincar expressed that the struggle with the Daaş directly after the referendum decision was taken, he said.
BARZANI said that he wanted to determine his destiny in a peaceful and democratic way for the people of ikb to protect and develop himself and said: "it has appeared with the documents that Iraq cannot protect us or does not want to protect us like a state."
"He doesn't want us to move forward." he defended his view.
During the fight against the terrorist organization deaş, the Iraqi central government did not give them weapons, but in a short period of time established with a fatwa Hashdi Shabi'nin immediately legalized and all weapons were provided in response barzani barzani said::
In Iraq's defence system, peshmergah was not included.
The central government did not do to Pesmerge that he offered to Shabi.
Peshmerge is considered part of Iraq's defence system, according to the Constitution.
However, while the Hadjabi had no existence in the Constitution, all possibilities were mobilized by breaking the laws.
We're not saying We're against the shabby shabby.
Peshmerga and Hashdi shabi fought on the same front, so why is peshmerga covering the legalization of the Shi'ite Shi'ite, the existence of the Peshmerga and the fight against terrorism?
These are our deep wounds with Baghdad.
On August 3, 2014, the terrorist organization deaş attacked the Ezidians living in the sincar district of Mosul and killed many people, including women and children.

Trump's White House now targets Statue of Liberty
The most definitive sign of regime change is that they start attacking the statues.
The Americans know as much about this as any of them; as a matter of fact, the overthrow of carefully fabricated Saddam Hussein in 2003 at Firdos Square in Baghdad...
Stephen Miller, one of the key theoreticians of the trump regime, knew precisely what he was doing when CNN's Jim Acosta and the President were symbolically destroying the Statue of liberty in a heated debate about the proposals for a hard-line restriction of legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller didn't attack the statue itself.
If he did, he'd be lynched by a full boat tour of Liberty.
But he attacked the meaning of it, and especially in 1903, 17 years after the monument itself was completed, the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added to the base of the monument, which was attributed to him.
When Miller went out to Acosta, he said, "I don't want to talk about history here, but Statue of Liberty... American freedom is the absurd symbol of light to the world.
The poem you mentioned was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is actually right, but as he says, it's not really about history.
This is about the contemporary echoing of Lazarus's frightening words, and not only does a state seem to be inviting not only some elderly immigrants but also the poor of the poor: "tired, poor, / clogged masses are longing to breathe freedom, / clogged land is not wanted perish."
There has never been a time when the "undesired" was so visible on our screens.
Miller did not bring any literary criticism; he explained that these people were not welcomed by Trump in the United States.
The conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is actually a conflict about the meaning of America.
Lazarus and his colleagues, who campaigned after his death to put his words on the base of the statue, knew very well that they had taken political action.
The statue was intended to celebrate the connections between French and American republicanism with a metaphor, representing freedom in the form of women.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in his poem, the female figure was no longer abstract, but he had a voice.
And he gives himself a very different name: the Mother of the exiled.
Marriage with the image of poetry is a genius feminist blow and a devastating attack on the anti-immigrant American.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right-wing men had long wanted to change it back.
Rush Limbaugh, who was the Baptist John-style for Trump's arrival, argued in 2010 that freedom did not invite anyone in, but that it was a neocon of early revolutions that kept the American fire in the dark.
He has to move the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not to shed light on the way to the United States."
In a very unusual way, Limbaugh actually discovered something.
The meaning of the statue was purely perception.
The magnificent creative action of Lazarus was to see it as being seen by depleted, wretched but hopeful people on board the ships after long and often miserable journeys.
It was really about seeing the world from the perspective of people looking for shelter and looking to improve their lives.
His statue responded to them with words of Hope and warm welcome that they needed to hear.
Of course, this is not a perspective that Miller and Trump would find justified in any way.
Their Torah is not to guide, but to provoke hatred, which is their only source of power.

World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the Great Britain team
Eilidh Doyle only remembers the time when two Scotsmen could get into the great British team.
Neil Black, UK athletic performance Director, says the Scottish team of 16 players in the World Championship team will contribute to the team.
The record-breaking Scottish athlete was named for London 2017, starting on Friday.
Black believes that "something is developing" in Scotland and that UK Athletics should learn from it.
Black said, "we embrace it, and we're trying to understand it, and we're going to deal with it until we get out of it." quoth.
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it's about what they're doing.
Scottish Athletics think it's about what they're doing.
British Athletics: he thinks it's about what they're doing.
So is the guy on the corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely fantastic."
He is competing for a number of Scottish athletes, including Laura Muir and Andrew butchart, who compete against Sir Mo Farah at 5000 m, and Eilidh Doyle was chosen as Captain by the squad.
"Eilidh is a little humble .
Captain talk was amazing."black says.
"No matter where they live or train, a few athletes came out of that room very proud and really motivated.
The passion and real feeling eilidh naturally added was amazing."
The silver medalist from the League of nations, who will compete for 400 m hurdles at the fifth world championship, says 16 Scottish athletes will be on the British team.
Scotland's best overall athlete in previous World Championships was seven, which was achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Muir is the middle distance Runner who broke five British and two European records last year.
1500 m and 5000 m.
Chris O'Hare, who had a very good season, including the British team trials and the Victories in the anniversary games, runs 1500 m, is another Scotch to watch.
Doyle remembers his first championship, where the only other Scottish player on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says he is "very proud" of the movement, because many of his fellow countrymen will not only join the team but will in some cases compete for the medal and fight to stay in the finals.
"The special aspect of being a team captain is that it was voted by other members of the team, so it was already a great honor, but knowing that your teammates voted for you and chose you made it extra special for me., "he added.
"Frankly, I'm proud of all the Scots on the team.
That shows how far we've gotten.
And they're here as proven athletes, as athletes who watch out for the podium.
As for the Captain's speech?
Yes, I think it went well.
I took advantage of the fact that we were very lucky in this situation, so there is a world championship at home.
I mean, this is really just the impact of taking advantage of this inner field support and the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to get out there and fight, and there's going to be such a great atmosphere."
Blocking critics on Facebook: if you can't take criticism of voters, you're a candidate for state duty
The father of our country had some knowledge of getting negative press coverage.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the Newspapers to begin to critically criticize him about everything from domestic politics to political principles.
Of course, he was disturbed by criticism.
But he didn't shut her up.
Because Washington in 1783, "freedom of speech can be eliminated and we can be dragged into the slaughter stupidly and silently."yes," he said.
This brings me to Larry Hogan, Governor of Maryland, who has to work harder to be like Washington.
Hogan's staff prevented and deleted at least 450 people who expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff didn't care about the case because it wasn't serious, and online comments said, "who cares?"full of reactions.
Many people say this is just Facebook." quoth.
But it's important.
This is especially important when you're like Hogan.
It is a Republican governor who is surprisingly popular in a state that is overwhelmingly democratic.
The country's 50 governors have the second highest rate of approval.
Hogan is not a reactionary lunatic.
He was a master of leadership and strict adherence to principles.
After chemotherapy, he was quite capable of using Facebook as a primary tool to connect his hairless head with his voter.
In other words, it is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to block people from the page of the governor, which is a public forum, which is officially classified and managed by the members of the staff who pay the tax dollars of the people.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's female spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the Governor's actions, claiming that blocking Comments Was more than just editing them.
But it's easy to use the images of trolls or spammers or hateful people making online verbal attacks.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are the real people who speak only to their chosen leaders: a teacher, a business owner, and a priest; not a troll.
They all said that their comments were not respectful, thoughtful and abusive.
The priest has quoted the Bible in his share, addressing Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma ramani from Bowie, Maryland, was not hateful, but asked about hate crimes.
The post commented to the comment section, "I am kindly disappointed that he has been unwilling to respond to hate crimes and other recent news."he wrote.
"I also don't like the idea that when many people comment on the same subject, they immediately ignore it as a collective effort rather than a large group of anxious citizens."
Others who the governor's staff call "intensified spam attack" will probably call it "advocacy."
Facebook makes it easy to make a message available through the prevention of an adversary or deletion of a negative message.
It is much cleaner than the old days when the staff were sent out to collect and burn Newspapers with critical writings or to arrest and silence the protesters.
But, digital, that's exactly what happened.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for neutralizing facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by Twitter streaming.
One of the decisions that might be a reference to this issue in the future came from Virginia last week.
Chairman of the Board of supervisors of the district of Loudoun, U.S. District Judge James C. According to cachheris, when he banned an election on Facebook, he violated the first Constitutional Amendment.
In Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (Republican) was visited by ACLU due to the use of facebook and twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, a reasonably priced post office had a similar effect on the internet.
Between 1775 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and unknown letter writers eroded his leadership.
Even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
All people who used nicknames like Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and portius wrote letters to the newspapers that put Washington's decisions under their feet.
According to the online George Washington articles Project, gathering historical documents, the petitions office, which criticised the stance of the Friendship, trade and navigation agreement with Britain, was overwhelmed.
But he didn't shut them up.
Freedom of expression, opposition and retribution is at the heart of our nation.
Real leadership means to accept it.

I found the answer
Think of a seat... The budget is more than the budget allocated to each of the eleven ministries, including the Ministries of Economy, Development, energy and natural resources, science, industry and Technology, environment and Urbanism, health, culture and tourism, with 6 billion 867 million Turkish liras!
The number of personnel is 117 thousand 378.
Turkey's largest "propaganda base!"
Yes, I'm talking about the presidency of Religious Affairs!
Yes, I'm going to talk about the Head of Religious Affairs, Mehmet görmez!
Days... I'm looking for answers to the question in my head...
I wonder why Mehmet gözez was taken from his seat...
I've read every article that comes out of being sent.
No.
I can't find the answer to the question I'm looking for.
It's early this year...
Mehmet Görmez has prepared the Strategic Plan of the Presidency of Religious Affairs (DIB) 2017-2021.
President Erdogan pulled 600 Mercedes with 1 million liras under it.
So he didn't have a problem with erdoğan.
So what happened?
You can say," as soon as seven years have served."
First DIB President. Rifat Börekçi served 17 years.
Mehmet Nuri yılmaz, who you all know, sat in that chair for 11 years.
So... The President's term of office is on.
I ask again: Why did Mehmet görmez leave his seat?
It's over...
Shia closeness
- According to the traditional ulama, Mehmet Dönmez did not have the people of the Sunnah!"
The Code of this sentence is this: he did not have circumcision!
The person who put this sentence in the back described: "it was modernist by the traditional ulema!"
I mean, Mehmet görmez was seen as innovative.
What do you mean, innovation?
The answer to the question was hidden on a trip abroad by Mehmet görmez.
Date: 27 December 2015
Mehmet Görmez went to Iran to attend the 29th Wahdah conference-which aims to bring the Islamic sects closer to Tehran.
Iran's religious leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei met.
He prayed by keeping the Shi'ite clergy pure.
And in the Conference he said: "sects are human schools that represent different ideas and opinions in understanding the Islamic religion."
The purpose of all of them is to determine the path to Allah.
Every one of them is in a secondary road, but the destination is the same.
It is never acceptable to mirror the denomination of religion or to see the denomination of the denomination on the basis of Islamic identity.
Sectarian separation, otherization and conflict are reflections of taassub and ignorance.
In the cases where the sects were in front of the religion, the most damaging religion was itself...
Here I would like to underline again:
Shiites and Sunnis are a single Ummah...
"No one can claim another because they perceive Islam as they understand it."..
In a year...
Only caferi leader Selahattin Özgündüz from Turkey attended the 30th Oasis Meeting.
So...
It's not Sunnis.
His visit to Iran and his speech at the conference made him the target of "traditional ulama".
The next Tehran Conference, represented by the Turkish state - again - was one of the reasons no one attended.
Mehmet görmez also had been invited four times since he came to office.
The reason was obvious: the traditional "ulema" against Shiite - Iran in DIB!"
Right after the Iranian trip, Mehmet görmez's seat was worn out in the beginning of 2016.
The Deputy Prime Minister, Numan kurtuluş, was responsible for the DIB at the beginning of this.
Mehmet görmez drowned so much that he asked for "to be connected to the Presidency of the DIB".
In essence,...
There was a difference in the view of Sunni within the State.
Some of the theoretical worlds created in Saudi Arabia and Egypt madrasahs, "traditional ulama", matched the Sunnism with Wahhabi-Salafism in the shade of the USA!
These were the opponents of Iran who would not tolerate even the Tehran trip.
It was not surprising that the words of Ahmet cübeli Mehmet görmez: "he did not come to the danger of this.'
"My Lord, let a good head who is loyal to the people of the country and loyal to the people of the country"...
They used the" identity of the people " as the symbol of hostility towards Iran .
The CIA-backed - Iran opposition, which the Fatah did for a while, was now running new names.
And with the fattening traps...
The photo of a young man with whiskey was served to the media with the lie "Son of Mehmet görmez"!
Ah, what a coincidence!
Who made the biggest opposition to Mehmet gözez in the media: Turkey, the newspaper of the US-led Lightworkers community.
as a result...
- Sunnism, Saudi Wahhabi-resistance not to bring to the line of Salafi...
- That's not fueling sectarian separation...
- Modernist... A cleric, his consciences were destroyed by the "traditional ulema" created during the Cold War era...
US culture imperialism continues to Arabize Turkey rapidly (and make its predecessor).
Do not doubt that the future Head of Religious Affairs will be the representative of Wahhabi-Salafi!

More than 4 thousand chronic patients ' social welfare news
The Ministry of family and social policies will benefit 4 thousand 300 TB and SSPE patients from the social assistance program, which will be launched for the poor citizens and their families struggling with chronic diseases.
The ministry, which plans to provide patients with monthly support over two-thirds of the minimum wage, will also provide regular psychosocial support.
According to the information obtained, the details and implementation principles of the new social assistance programme for families who are struggling with chronic diseases have been determined by the order of the Minister of family and Social Policy, Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya.
The social assistance program, which was launched with the aim of supporting citizens who struggle with chronic diseases in cooperation with the Ministry of health and who have economic and psychological difficulties, has become the first in many aspects in the world.
The Ministry will also provide regular psychosocial support to families, not just cash, through the Social Assistance Program.
Thus, it is aimed not to leave the poor citizens and their families both financially and spiritually with chronic disease and continue their treatment processes at home.
According to the studies, in the first stage, the unemployed people who struggle with subacute sclerosis Panensefalitis (sspe), a brain disease caused by tuberculosis disease and measles microbes will be given regular psychosocial and cash support within the scope of the social welfare program.
In the later stages of the programme, poor citizens who struggle against other rare and risky diseases will be included in the aid programme.
In addition to the support that is planned to be given at a rate of more than two-thirds of the minimum wage, additional payments can be made to TB patients who are unable to receive medical self-care, who are dependent on bed or who are determined by the health department to improve their home living conditions.
In order to benefit from the support, the monthly income per capita is required to be less than two thirds of the monthly net amount of the minimum wage.
In addition, citizens with sspe should have a health board report prepared in accordance with the principles and procedures stated in the Regulation on "Disability criteria, classification and health board reports to be given to Disabled People".
According to the survey, more than 1 out of 5 U.S. passengers bring banned goods to the plane
According to a survey carried out with airline passengers, more than 20 percent of them intentionally or unknowingly smuggled items from control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Department, including at least 6 percent of them carrying illicit knives or sharp objects without knowing it.
Less than 1 percent later claimed to have accidentally traveled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
Research conducted by the jet Charter Service, Stratos jet charters, has also found that younger passengers are more likely to break the rules.
19.7 per cent of the participants admitted that they were deliberately trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, but less than 15 are members of the X zone.
Food and liquids are the most common substances deliberately smuggled from TSA agents.
More than 3 percent admit that they deliberately smuggled sharp instruments from security, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents admitted that they deliberately carried illicit drugs on board the aircraft.
The company said How many people accidentally smuggled goods from airport security and did a nationwide survey to find out how many people did it on purpose.
It is not a surprise that the most likely people to intentionally or unknowingly smuggled goods through security are the ones who fly the most.
However, as the firm has pointed out, TSA rules are a bit complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure about which fluids or how much they can carry.
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of substances seized by the TSA came into being as prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought that TSA might be treating books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but international ones are not allowed.
China welcomes us statements
China's Foreign Minister, Vang Yi, at a press conference in Beijing, cited Tillerson's Pyongyang Administration as "regime change, regime collapse, the peninsula to quickly reunify and our troops to 38. we're not looking for an excuse to send it north of the paralel." he said they care about their statements.

EPA President Pruitt has renounced Obama-era Emission Reduction laws
One day after being sued by 15 States, Environmental Protection Organization Chief Scott Pruitt recalled earlier the decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era laws, which reduced air pollutant emissions that caused dirty smoke.
Pruitt represented the exchange of his own organization with the need of State Environmental regulators more sensitive to the past administrations.
A federal Supreme Court never mentioned the subject of a legal appeal against its previous position.
The question is that the States start to meet the end of the 2015 standards for ground level ozone 1 October.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone compliance for one year to give his organization more time to work on the plan and to avoid "interfering with local decisions or preventing economic growth".
Before his appointment by President Donald Trump, pruitt, the State Attorney General of Oklahoma, served for a long time as a reliable ally against stricter environmental arrangements.
Since arriving in Washington, pruditt has acted repeatedly to prevent or delay the regulations that the chemical and fossil fuel industries are against.
Wednesday's abrupt change is the latest legal defeat by Pruitt for the agenda to undo the regulation.
Last month, a federal High Court in Washington ruled that the EPA executive's attempt to delay the implementation of an Obama administration law requiring oil and gas companies to inspect and reduce methane leaks has exceeded its authority.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt said that the return to ozone standards strengthened the commitment of the EPA to meet new standards only with States in time and to work through complex processes.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines for decisions, waiting to be prosecuted by activist groups and others, and agreed to resolve the dispute to set the timing for the decision."
"We do not believe in the arrangement through trial and we take the dates of the term seriously.
We also take the law seriously and the powers it gives us."
However, the EPA's statement stated that Pruitt could use the authority to delay it once again and all other legally available powers to ensure that the regulations are "supported with sound policies and Best available knowledge".
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a wider rewriting of ozone laws.
A parliamentary bill approved last month is trying to delay the implementation of the 2015 laws for at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been brought to the Senate for a vote.
New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman, who led the state coalition that sued the EPA this week, said the Group intends to continue legal pressure.
"Following our trials, the EPA's decision-making is an important gain for the health and safety of 6,7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the filthy smoke that flows into their communities."
The case was attended by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and district of Columbia.
When general pollutants are released by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources that react to sunlight in the atmosphere, ozone is produced at ground level.
The resulting polluted smoke can lead to serious breathing problems in a rapidly affected group of people and contributes to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists applaud Pruitt's surprise decision-making.
Lori Ann burd from the Center for Biodiversity said: "it is disturbing that we need so much pressure from the person who is responsible for protecting the air we breathe."
"We must continue to fight against the ideological struggle of the trump administration against the polluters and interest groups."

The patient relatives broke the doctor's nose
The Doctors and staff of the Turkish Higher Education and research hospital left a short-term job yesterday morning in response to the beating of a doctor's friends by their patient relatives.
The crowd gathered in front of the hospital's main entrance with the foreign currency that said "No to violence in health" in their hands, reacted to the incident.
Prof. Dr. Feyza Aşenur Paş, "no violence in health"slogan seems insufficient to me, even as a party slogan."
In health, there's no place for violence.
"If it goes this way, this people will soon not be able to find a self-serving health group," he said.
Ankara Provincial Health Director Dr. Kamil Türkmen, Ankara First Regional Public Hospitals Secretary General Prof. Dr. Öner Odabaş, Head of Turkish Higher Education and research Hospital Prof. Dr. Mustafa paç and his relatives in the hospital garden also supported.
Paç, who condemned the incident, said::
Unfortunately, violence against health workers is increasing.
We have experienced an example of this event yesterday (the day before) in the evening with the beating of a patient by our cardiopulmonary surgery physician.
Although we have taken all the measures we can as our state, Ministry and governorship for these events to be concluded as soon as possible, we demand that our people increase their sensitivity on this subject.
I condemn yesterday's events on behalf of my Hospital and my health care workers.
Odabaş pointed out that the society should be aware of the violence in health, " unfortunately, this time we live, has become a professional complication."
"We will take our own measures, but most importantly, our nation's own health care workers," he said.
Stating that the judicial process related to the incident began, Türkmen said: "our laws regarding violence in health have been effective enough."
That's what the ranks of the state are doing.
The police are working right now.

YPG looting in Syria...
The United States intervened
According to local sources, the YPG terrorists raided the homes of the residents of Tel Semin in the northern part of Rakka, where they entered the US military support for fighting with the terrorist organization deaş.

Let's not carry the old world's fights tomorrow.
Delayed perception of the realities of the country and the world can cause the countries to drift into crises rather than simply.
One of the reasons for the delayed perception of the world realities of the backward East, which we describe as "singularity," may be that the reflection of these realities on the geography of the East is prevented by certain focus or announced in a surreal way.
Don Quixote and Oblomov have been the subject of the world of literature to detect the facts and change by delay or not at all.
Cervantes ' "Don Quixote"is a madman who still thinks he is a knight on the way back when the bourgeoisie began to form.
Or Gonçarov's "Oblomov"is a lazy legacy that thinks that when he ignores the facts, everything can go back to the way it used to be.
The Chinese example, for example, was closed when China was in a country that was open to the world until the end of the 15th century and dominated by the seas, when a conservative dynasty was overthrown.
This was based on the execution of the captain of the boats out of the Chinese land waters.
We Turks, who have one foot, eye and Ear in the west, the other foot, eye and Ear in the East, have had constant dilemmas about perceptions of the truth and change starting with the Ottoman Empire.
Our old and new section tried to move past and present, to understand the present with the concepts that fit the old conditions, to think yesterday and tomorrow.
One part of us was able to act as fast as the focus of thought in developed countries in terms of perceiving the realities of the country and the world as well as the change.
This has been a source of constant conflict and tension.
The University with the madrasah, the modern army with the janissary, the doubts about faith, caused dramatic dualism.
Even worse, it is not accepted that the new and forward positions will be obsolete and will remain behind at the end of certain periods.
Yesterday's progressives began to declare the new and advanced as "dangerous", and those who tried to interpret the current conditions of the country and the world as "traitors".
The most important lesson was that the Ottoman Empire collapsed, and the people became poor.
The most important lesson of our Ottoman past was the fact that the rapid perception of world conjuncture and change is an inevitable precondition for survival.
Since this course is very well assimilated, we have been a model country of this geography that has managed to preserve its unity, integrity and stability in peace since the First World War.
In order to survive the global change process, which has been entered into a different approach, we have to leave the memorials behind and act in harmony with the realities.
In other words, no one will be able to carry the meaningless campuses and blood feuds that have caused our democracy to limp in the past.
Moreover, the smallest mistakes in today's world lead to very large and dramatic crises.
The most problematic geography is the Middle East in which we live.

This is the most urgent task and it is also of great importance with regard to the European Union.
"One of the most important steps of this is the purchase cost of 10.3 dollars/cent per kilowatts with a share of domestic contribution to the wind, with a historical record of 3.48 dollars/cent, and a world record price of 3.48 dollars / cent."

Moore's Ford massacre: activists revived the racist Lynch incident to call for Justice
A 1948 Ford mercury was passed through a group of spectators in the Monroe Georgia countryside, and the twirling Ming was advancing towards the small Ford Bridge in Moore.
Four black passengers and a white driver, a group of white men armed before reaching the bridge to close the road.
The leader of the gang, a man in a middle-aged slender suit, breathed a long breath of his cigar and carefully gazed through the windshield.
The residents were terrified. 
"That z.....we want to, Roger!"the man barked.
"Get him out of the car!"
A young black man was drifting from the front passenger seat, screaming through the darkness.
Fortunately, this horrific scene played on June 22nd is just a revival.
But when a loop was thrown around Roger's neck, almost everyone from the audience breathed in a very realistic way.
Since 2005, human rights activists have been returning to the Ford bridge in Moore to revive the lynching of two black couples (Roger and Dorothy malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey) by the ku klux clan in 1946.
So far, no one has been charged with murder.
Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the reconstruction, said: "it is inconceivable that one person has not been arrested all these years, whether we see them in our societies or we know who they are."
"This is a stain in history, but a burden in our souls."
Brooks was a former state Congressman at the age of 71 in Georgia and a lifelong human rights activist.
For him, this revival is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to Monroe society that injustice has never been corrected.
He said: "We want to prosecute, we want results, we want to heal wounds, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice."
"We cannot have it until we have the justice to heal wounds and compromise."
The coroner Put a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Ford lincin in Moore on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men were suspected of lynching Monroe and surrounding areas.
But not one of them has ever been investigated.
Although suspects remain fugitives for decades, human rights activists say the twin motivations of lynching are always well-known throughout the town: politics and sex.
In April 1946 a High Court ruling made it possible for black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer at the end of the elections.
According to the FBI, at almost the same time as the election, black Partner Roger Malcom stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, about a woman, apparently during a fight.
Brooks said that the town's name was that Heston slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy, and that the baby he carries was not his husband.
According to the FBI, Loy Harrison, a leading white landowner on July 25, 1946, paid$ 600 to get Malcolm out of jail.
Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey went to prison under escort.
But as they drove away from the prison, when they came to the Ford Bridge in Moore, a Lynch mob surrounded the car.
An FBI report said, "it turns out it was Harrison who ordered the murders."he concludes.
"And obviously there was a secret agreement between the state and the local law enforcement authorities, which not only included in the murder, but also destroyed evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks told me more briefly and concisely.
He said: "this was a right to vote massacre."
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this society:" that's what happens to you if you register and vote.'"
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has been managing the revival of the Ford Bridge Lynch in Moore, which takes place every year.
His performance is based on a deep kind of racism that many no longer believe exists in the United States.
It's hard to watch, and it's even harder to turn your gaze, but Greene says that's the point.
He said, "We don't want to talk about lynching because it's confronting all of us with the ugly inside of us."
"But if you're not listening to me or listening to what happened to me, I can't develop a relationship with you."
This year's rehearsals began in June, and on the first day around 30 actors (a dozen white and the rest black) filled a room, and Greene reluctantly entered the game's well-rehearsed outline.
Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's co-director.
Over the years, President Klansman has played the role, but he says the role is never easy.
Marbaugh said: "I feel dirty because it's not me."
"But I think it's important to keep this past alive because we don't want to go back to that time."
Actors who played Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester throughout the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona were rehearsing their own lines.
The game begins when Malcolm shouted at Hesse, who was so angry that he was sleeping with his wife Dorothy, and pushed him.
"Z....I said, get out of my property!"
He's reacting to the rascona.
There's a hit.
And then everyone (at least, black actors) choking with laughter.
He's laughing at Greene the most.
"What?!"he asked me.
He was anxious, surprised.
Was I too hard?
Greene said, "No" in the giggles.
"Only then was the z of white people...I don't think you said that."
One of the Black players threw a stone mixed with a joke saying "yes."
"You have to press R."
So the energy in the room is changing, and some kind of intimacy replaces unrest.
Everyone is dedicated to doing it right, not only for the sake of the game, but also for the memory of the four killed.
The scene is starting again.
This time Rascona says the word that starts with n, sharp and accentuated.
Absolutely no one laughs.
The revival ends violently and quickly.
There's screams, gunfire, and then silence.
A woman in funeral black stands on the bodies of the actors and reads Billie Holiday's sad eulogy "strange fruit".
He's breaking his voice in one of the two words.
A group of four dozen spectators, on average, wipe out sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost equally divided into black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York to see the performance, most of them down the road.
While Brooks took them to the malcoms and Dorsey cemeteries, they all relied on Georgia's repressive moisture for almost eight hours.
To this point, the murders were left as an anecdote, but now the same place where lincin is meant to be a curse of the air.
While the final notes of the song are weakened, Greene invites the crowd to converge and examine their bodies.
Children squatting on their hands, clutching fake blood and still bodies and whispering to each other.
"They didn't really die."he croons.
In a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd and all of a sudden it's over.
Actors throw a lynching rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw is hugging Marbaugh in a suit that plays President Klansman.
Nick rascona is hugging two of his fellow players and tears are pouring in their arms, and the emotional cost of performance finally comes to him.
One of the women said, "it's okay."he whispers.
"We know that's not what's in your heart.
You did it for a reason."
Then the audience sits at dinner with the actors.
At a table, the white couple from Atlanta is fervently chatting with a black couple about revival.
Denise duplinski has trouble finding words about how performance feels.
He said, "This is terrible, horrible words to hear, and those behaviors... they go out with people who look like you, and they do that because they look like you."
"What it does to me is make me think that lynching is still going on, "he added."
At the end of the room, Tyrone Brooks is the center of attention when he eats at the table and tells human rights stories.
He said he's already planning next year's performance.
He said, "the revival is inspiring in a way because it describes what we have done, but also instructive."
"It's like if you don't learn from it, it could happen again.
Those who do not investigate their own past, those who do not know their own past, are doomed to repeat it."

Text 2 again took him to death!
According to the forensic institute's first report, the first findings in Hakan's preliminary autopsy report suggest that his death was suicide.
In the detailed examination, no traces of any kind of trauma and algebra were found in the child's body.
The reason for suicide is that the elastic bandage that is filled with his neck is asphyxiated as a result of squeezing.
It was also determined that the cloth indicated by his family as bandage was elastic bandage used in the wounds.
Newspaper Haberturk'tan Muslim Sarıyar reported that after the preparation of a detailed report on the child's death, the report stating that the incident was suicide, the investigation will be sent to the Prosecutor of the Republic Büyükçekmece.
Police investigate the child's suicide in full detail, and after the incident, the investigation of the confiscated computer continues.
The police said they would apply to Hakan's friends ' statements.
It is also stated that the information obtained from Hakan's computer, which his relatives call "cleaned up", can be accessed to third parties or to a gang.
Police are evaluating that a suicide gang may have dragged Hakan.
The fact that Hakan committed suicide turned his eyes into violent metin2.
Metin2, which was banned from children under 15 by the Antalya Governorate last year on the grounds that it caused addiction and violence in children, came up with the killing of Metin Kang, a 13-year-old"tiny hacker", in 2009.
2005 in order to play"metin2"designed in Korea, it is necessary to enter the site and register a member.
Players are trying to bring peace and justice to the world with the god of the dragon in the game.
In doing so, there are wars, the dose of violence is increasing.
In addition to war images made with sharp, piercing weapons such as lines, swords, pala, axe, as well as images of people destroyed by wild animals and eaten by meat.
The player buys characters with money to get stronger.
The family who buried their children the next day after the incident on 25 July at the house on Köknar street, the district of Esenyurt, continued the murder claim.
Father Mehmet Ekinci, "the whole imaginary was to become a doctor, because of the game do not think that damage to himself or someone else," he said, "wrapped the elastic bandage around his neck and threw a knot next to the side."
That's how it was found, son.
We certainly don't think that our son could harm himself or anyone else because of an Internet game or commit suicide.
We knew you were playing a game like this.
It wasn't a game he was playing.
Let's say a little bored out of the game.
Anne Gülizar ekinci said, "there is no one in or out of the building."

ILKER Karas: may be involved in the gang
Families generally don't pay attention to this issue.
"My child is at home or whatever happens."
The child is communicating with a lot of people through the games.
There may be a debt settlement situation, or there may have been a blasphemy.
Or he invited a person in the game to the house, and they might have had trouble with each other.
Not directly from the game, but through the game to communicate with other people because of the problems that may have been affected.
The visuals of the game, the fiction of the child may have thought the truth.
The trauma that led to suicide may be related to blackmail.
If the child is faced with the situation of complaining to the family, it will not solve the problem, there is also the situation of being dragged to depression.
Couldn't have committed suicide because of the game itself.
There's a chance The Kid's getting into the gang.
He could have been involved in the gang.
There can be nothing that the child can do individually.
Information Systems Consultant FÜSUN nebil: families should know the interaction of their children
We can't say games are harmful.
Research also says games are useful for children's development.
What is important here is that parents pay attention to what their children play and how they talk to the players online.
Parents should know how children are affected by content and take precautions.
In Turkey, there are only 2 children in 5 years that are said to have died due to the game.
This shows that the end of a child's life is not just the effect of games.
I wonder what drove this kid to this.
First we need to find out.
You need to look at the sociology and psychology around the child.
Stock exchange in Istanbul, 8-month return was based on 50 percent
The bist 100 Index continued its upward trend starting in December 2016 in July and moved its upward to the 8th month above.
This is the first time since July 2007, the index has risen for 8 months in a row, while the index has gained 45.3 percent in this period.
The BIST 100 index, which has left behind the major markets in the world, including Germany, USA, UK and Japan with its performance since the beginning of the year, did not leave the leadership in return for return in July.
In the US, Dow Jones index followed the FTSE 100 Index by 0.81 percent, with a 2.54 percent increase in the BIST 100 index, which completed a 7.06 percent rise in July.
With the DAX index in ALMAYA, the Nikkei index in Japan ended July with a loss of value.
As of January-July period, the bis 100 Index exhibited a high performance both from the major world stock markets and from the emerging country stock markets.
This year, according to the closing of 2016 percent 37.6 BIST 100 Index, 10.76 percent increase in the Dow Jones index, with 5.55 percent value gain DAX index, with 4.55 percent rise Nikkei Index, followed by the FTSE 100 Index, with 3,21 percent increase.
The MSCI em index, which is indicative of emerging markets, has yielded 23 percent returns.
Looking at the historical process of the bis 100 Index, it has shown similar performances in the past.
The BIST 100 index, which was last rated at 8 months in a row between December 2006 and July 2007, increased by 38.3 percent in this period.
In addition, the bist 100 Index was completed in August 1996 and March 1997 by gaining value in 9 consecutive months between May 1997 and January 1998.
Mekssa Investment Research Director Eren can umut, AA correspondent in a statement, BIST 100 Index continued to rise for 8 months indicating that the year since the beginning of the rise has exceeded the level of 37 percent, he said.
UMUT, MSCI emerging markets (em) index recorded a 23 percent rise, even if we look at these ratios, indicating that the positive separation is noted as follows::
The Fund flow to developing countries has been continuing since the beginning of the year.
In particular, funds seeking higher returns prefer higher interest rate countries.
As a result, domestic markets are positively affected.
Of course, the appetite of taking risks on a global scale is quite high.
In this way, stock indexes of risky assets are popular.
In the United States, the S&P 500 index has been tested for new record levels almost every week in parallel with an increase of around 11 percent since the beginning of the year.
At the beginning of the year, the US Central Bank (fed) stressed that 3 interest rate hike forecast markets are stressed, but the Fed's verbal orientation policy is quite good and eliminates uncertainty, Umut noted that the Fed has a market that is insensitive to interest rate hike.
Umut stated that inflation in the USA is not at the desired level yet, the expectations of the Fed will not be hasty about the interest rate increase and will avoid radical moves are also very effective in the current pricing.
U.S. President Donald Trump's failure to repeal the health reform known as "Obama" has strengthened the perception that he cannot fulfill His promises of expansive fiscal policies, "although the expectations of the faster growing U.S. economy through Trump have a positive impact on the stock markets, but the promises have not been made for a period of faster growth and the quoth.
Umut pointed out that 2016 is a year in which many negative effects are experienced in terms of Turkish markets and said that bis 100 index, which is negative and sold over and over, is in an effort to close the gap compared to similar ones.
Umut said they did not see a strong recovery with the domestic source news flow and said that the current Outlook could be interpreted as triggering the demand to close the gap in domestic markets compared to similar ones with an increase in the appetite of taking more risks abroad.
Umut, technical levels of 108.600 with a new record-tested bis 100 Index followed some profit sales by expressing, said::
In particular, the 109.500-110,000 region is a critical threshold in the short term.
After approaching these levels, profit sales are normal.
In the short term, we think that a local or global New Story should be created for over 110,000 prices.
For now, the downtrend of 107.500 support could trigger profit sales.
In this case, even if we follow 107,000 intermediate support 106.000-105.500 I think it can be seen to loosen up to the region.
In particular, breaking 105.500 support can bring a retracement to 104.300, which corresponds to Fibo 50 percent of the rise from 100.000 to 108.600.
Both fed and European Central Bank (ECB) decisions will be the focal point of the global market, indicating Umut, fed expectations for the already obvious expectations for September FOMC'de interest rate hike is not expected, but the possibility of the introduction of the balance sheet reduction program may trigger strengthening U.S. dollars, he said.
Umut said that this situation could trigger profit sales in the stock indexes of the developing country (GOU), which is under the shadow of over-buying in the short term, and added: "besides, what is important is what the ECB is going to say."
Mario Draghi, Chairman of the ECB after the July Monetary Policy Committee meeting, expressed that they would discuss the course of monetary policy in autumn, and that the euro/dollar parity rose above 1.1700 levels.
Therefore, explanations on whether the monthly asset purchase program of 60 billion euros will be reduced or terminated will mean that post-fed liquidity will be reduced by ECB on a global scale.
"Therefore, in the name of the country markets which give High Current Account deficits and have access to foreign funds, negative prices may lead to". he was in his evaluation.
In November 2016, Gedik investment investment advisory Manager Erol gürcan stated that after the election of Trump as president in the United States, there was a very serious rally in terms of global stock markets.
Gürcan, this rally movement triggers the Basic Element Trump'nin promises to reduce the global growth expectations, especially in terms of progress is possible to say that it is possible to say, said::
Stock market in Istanbul was one of the leading stock markets in the global rally.
One of the most important reasons for this is that the bis 100 Index has been relatively discounted in recent years compared to similar emerging country markets, but it is worth mentioning that the steps taken by policy makers to support the economy and financial markets have played a significant role.
In particular, we can say that the credit Guarantee Fund (kgf), which has become active as of March, has a serious impact on the rise observed in the index so far.
The rest of the year and this is reflected in significantly positive developments for which the pricing has an important role in the cgf's saturated and slowly rise that has Gürcan, BIST 100 Index is currently discounted compared to similar country markets continues to remain slow for the remaining period of the year, although the story stated that a new quest could come to the forefront.
Gürcan, especially for some time the details of the anticipated 180-day action plan, such as increasing the limit of the credit Guarantee Fund to support the company's profits in the direction of regulations, recent developments such as possible tax reductions on the agenda can contribute positively, he said.
Gürcan, fed, ECB and Bank of England (BoE), such as central banks of developed countries are also slowly important, albeit having to tighten the current expansionary monetary policy stance also is among the critical risk elements for developing countries, stressing that "once in a while in moderation, after which interest continues to increase with very high probability the Fed will launch the month of September the balance sheet reduction process, terminating the possibility of the ECB asset purchase program in the near term the Fed and the BoE, which will then increase interest from the central banks of major developed countries, key developments that should be followed in this regard is likely to be, will be" the assessment found.
He said that the support zone, which corresponds to the 200-hour moving average with the upward trend seen since the beginning of the year, was very critical in the upcoming Quarter, and that in case of breaking the support zone, the correction action could continue until 101.700, 100.000, 99.2002, respectively.
Gürcan said that the index could rise up to 110,000-112,000 if the current upward trend is sustained and the current historic peak resistance of 108.605 is broken.

New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment test
In Sweden, the latest results of the evaluation tests of refugees subjected to a new medical age assessment method have been judged that more than 80 percent of the test participants are over 18 years old, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these tests.
Sweden's national forensic medicine and Drug Administration (Rättsmedicinnerverket) began testing earlier this year.
The tests were designed to make the age assessment more accurate in the asylum process after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to assess the correct age of some refugees who claim to be underage.
So far Migrationsville has sent 6880 cases to the test and the forensic medicine and medicine department has now announced the results of 2481 of the tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80 percent (2002 Number) were judged to be 18 or above, in 25 cases, the forensic medicine and Drug Administration ruled that the subject was "probably 18 or above"."
In 432 cases, the result was that the person was probably under 18.
The tests were performed only in cases where the age of the person was suspect.
According to Johan Göransson of the Department of forensic medicine, the results are consistent with past months.
"We don't see a big difference in statistics over the past months," said the local." quoth.
The proportion of cases judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that refugees are lying about their age.
In May, the department announced the results of the 581 test and said there were 442 cases, which "showed that the persons surveyed were 18 years old or older."
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of 581 cases published, he found that 243 cases clearly stated that he was 18 this year.
The medical age assessment method, which includes taking X-rays of the 20-year-old teeth and scanning the MRI of the knee joints, then analyzing them to dentists and radiologists, is criticized in some circles.
One of the suspects is Claude Marcus, the endocrinologist of the Karolinska Institute, evaluating the biological maturity of people who have studied whether the age of puberty was earlier or later than normal.
"I have reasons to think about it, and I don't think this should be the kind of measurement used.
It's very doubtful to decide on the biological age this way.
If we can't tell for sure, we shouldn't pretend to be."he said to the metro newspaper.
However, the Department of forensic medicine and Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: "in general, the risk of a child being misjudged as an adult may be small.
The risk is about 10 per cent if the person is below the age of 18."

You've improved your trainer.
Then they called me, but you didn't go this time.
Some think you chose Turkey for the money.
What do you say?
The last thing I remember about Cuba was my departure from the national team.

President of Tydta Ermut: foreign direct investment is above last year
President of Tydta Arda ermut, last year, 55 percent of all the investment came after July, he said.
On the contrary, there is no decrease in investments due to the 15 July fateful coup attempt, Ermut said, "maybe there will be more increases, ket shot."
Maybe if these conditions were not formed, if there were no regional developments, we could see a greater increase in the impact of the multiplier.
That's why we're more hopeful for the next year.
I hope it will be a brighter year in terms of direct investment.
In fact, as of the first 5 months, we are going to increase by 11 percent compared to the first 5 months of last year.
But we don't think that's enough.
"We hope there will be more." he used his statements.
"Whether global or regional developments are not driving us to worry," said Ermut, adding that they are trying to diversify investors.
Ermut reminded that 75 percent of direct investments came from Europe until 2010.:
This figure fell to 66 percent.
Again, Asia's share rose from 2 percent to 7-8 percent.
Russia's share has increased.
While we were trying to do this, the Gulf countries had some problems between them.
Turkey has good relations with all of its neighbors, especially Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
But the problem between these two countries upset us and consequently allows investors to postpone their decisions a little bit.
Not only in terms of investments in Turkey, we may be experiencing delays due to this.
Arda ermut reminded that last week there were some incidents about Germany, but that the government, especially President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, had a clear and definite reaction to this situation.
When the investors of countries experiencing the most severe political crisis, President Erdogan's reaction, " look, problems between governments, certainly not among the peoples."
Secondly, these people came and invested in my country.
For us, they are no different from Turkish companies.
On the contrary, they will come to us when they have the slightest problem, and we will solve it.
"We will certainly not allow them to be victims." ermut expressed that they continued to support all investors with the convenience of it expressed that.
Ermut, "we can guarantee this in the coming period."
You will see that neither German companies, nor investors from countries where there are political problems in any way will be a problem.
On the contrary, I hope we will do our best to increase investments from these countries.
We believe that the investments from here will continue to increase.
Of course, political developments can sometimes affect perceptions of the investment environment.
"But we will do our best to do our part at this point and not to be affected by the perception of investment environment." he was in his evaluation.
Tydta President ermut, after a single generation of road strategy, Turkey started to see great interest from China, but if the problems in the Gulf if solved, they expect the largest investment from the Gulf, he said.

"Currently, nearly 10 percent of the projects in our portfolio are German companies."
So almost 10 percent of the companies we talk to from all over the world are German companies.
Some of these companies have already invested in Turkey.
He's going to expand his investment or something, and he's going to be open as a project.
"Therefore, German companies are still an important part of our daily workflow." , he said.
All state institutions should be careful during the period of perception operations to Turkey, emphasizing that Ermut, the subject is sensitive and the slightest bad communication can be affected expressed.
Ermut, last 2-3 weeks is a good course of what happened, said::
Investors and politicians always have a different agenda.
We have always seen that economic relations always allow political developments to take a turn.
Germany will continue to be our important trading partner and an important investor.
Because they already have a lot of investments in Turkey.
The election agenda in Germany is unfortunately increasing such discourse.
I think that when they pass, they'il get a little better.
In Saudi Arabia, the two countries are paying attention not to make any negative statements.
As a result, an investment investor in Turkey is investing by targeting the markets of all the surrounding countries.
Therefore, not because of Saudi Arabia, but because of the uncertainty in the region has slowed down a little.
But we're still negotiating with these investors.
My personal opinion is that investors are waiting for a decision that they may be able to make faster.
We do not have a Saudi investor who says, " I see uncertainty because of the crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia in a negative sense."
On the contrary, we have Saudi investors who still live in Turkey, who meet with us during their holiday here, and who follow all their processes.
Arda ermut, International direct investments (UDI) from Turkey last year, 12.3 billion dollars reminded, "I think we will definitely pass it this year.
"But how far we will pass, these regional developments will affect global uncertainties." quoth.
Ermut, indicating that the impact of the multiplier will be more than normal, maybe a little more limited as of the first 5 months of 11 percent increase went, indicating that it can be preserved, "I hope if there is no bad development, I believe one way or another, the end of the year, compared to last year will certainly close better". he explained.
Pointing out that a significant portion of the investments will continue to be real estate Ermut, logistics, health, fintech, it, Petro-chemistry, food, energy and manufacturing in the field of new investments can be seen informed.
Stating that there will be new investments to announce in the coming months, Ermut said: "We may have an investment announcement in terms of manufacturing in the near future."

"There may be investments in interesting countries". he was in his evaluation.

During the 3-year FFP evaluation period, which continues until 2018, clubs can suffer losses of 30m euros.
Although Platini has been disrespectful to the presidency in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Cefer in UEFA, is still determined to give up over-spending.
Andrea Traversso, managing the FFP in UEFA, told The Associated Press last week: "FFP is certainly not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules by moving forward."

Neymar has signed a 5-year agreement so that the transfer fee can be shown as a cost of 44.4 million euros in the annual accounts of the next 5 years.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 saw the application of the heaviest sanctions to Manchester City, owned by PSG and Abu Dhabi.
PSG was later fined € 60m ($82m for that time), which dropped to € 20m, and was ordered to limit the Champions League team to 21 players, instead of normally, for the 2014-2015 season.
UEFA is vigilant against clubs that may try to deceive financial regulators by inflating their income through affiliated companies with owners of the club.
Although a cataract company may sponsor PSG, if the value of sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market value, UEFA will not allow it to be regarded as a legitimate revenue.
That was when the Qatar Tourism Authority ruled that PSG sponsorship was inflated in UEFA 2014.
Some of Nymar's earnings from the PSG have been reported to come through the payment of Qatar's 2022 World Cup Organising Committee.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 denied that Neymar would be the Ambassador to the World Cup, and such a move could be easily revealed by UEFA regulators.
The sanctions imposed on the PSG in the past mean that UEFA will be even more cautious against attempts to circumvent the rules.
UEFA is not in a preventive interview with the PSG about the transfer of Neymar, the foundation said on Tuesday.
Since they were not authorized to talk about the status of the PSG, they spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
Recently published accounts show that PSG made more than 10 million euros in revenues of 542,4 million euros in 2015-16.
Accounts of last fiscal year have not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to contribute to sponsorship agreements, gift and form sales.
The club expects the turnover to increase by at least 30 percent after signing.
The Spanish League, clearly disturbed by the departure of one of the greatest players of football, tried to prevent the departure of Neymar from the claim that PSG violated the FFP.

Insurers 'ceiling price' rebellion
According to TSB data, the insurance sector has been damaged in traffic sector since 2006.
The sector suffered 2.35 billion TL in 2015, while only 19 million TL profit in 2016.
The Stock Market is traded in Aksigorta, Anadolu Sigorta and güneş sigorta in Istanbul.
Speaking at the meeting where the results of the first six months of the TSB were evaluated, caglar said that the 11-year loss in traffic insurance had reached TL 7.3 billion, and with the application of ceiling Premium, the sector's losses would rise to TL 2.3 billion this year and the estimated damage-premium ratio would rise to 125 percent.
Caglar said that 2015 figure will be captured this year, and other branches of damage written in 2012 and 2015 to take the profit, "this means that we are financing the bad driver and increasing the price of the citizen's housing policy."
"75 percent of the sector is Foreign, and our partners abroad are financing the bad driver in some way," he said.
The ages continued:
We have no expectation of profit from traffic, but when we look at the past 11 years, we can not show that no year profit.
"We accept this, but we continue to hope that we can carry the damage in a reasonable environment, together with other policies," he said.
Çağlar said that there are dramatic price increases when traffic damage leads to profitability of other products, "in 2012, traffic insurance increased around 30 percent, in 2015 almost doubled, we wrote the biggest damage of our history."
"Even in an environment where prices have risen so much, at the end of 2016, our profits were only 19 million TL," he said.
Caglar said they expect to exceed the free tariff next year, "free tariff will reduce the price of the good driver and bad driver will apply a high price."
"But the Treasury is looking at the general trend, the last word about when it will happen is the treasury," he said.
The undersecretariat of treasury stated that the rise in compulsory traffic insurance premiums since 2015 has affected a large part of the society and started to apply the maximum premium (ceiling price) as of April 12.
According to this, maximum premiums were determined for compulsory traffic insurance on the basis of provincial groups determined by considering the traffic intensity and accident statistics of each vehicle group regarding compulsory traffic insurance policies to be arranged.
On the other hand, as of July, the application of "pool of risk insurers" was put into effect for the groups of vehicles with high damage frequency in the compulsory traffic insurance.
Premium and damage related to traffic insurance policies within the pool will be shared between insurance companies.
The premiums of these insurers will be determined by the undersecretariat of Treasury.
Caglar said that the premium production in traffic in the first 6 months of 2017 decreased by 11.5 percent compared to the same period of the previous year, the number of policies increased by 4.9 percent to 8.6 million, and the discount in traffic policies increased by about 30 percent considering inflation.
This year the traffic will take the profits again in other branches said Caglar, "this damage can not be sustained at the prices of ceiling.
How much longer can the sector carry this damage?" quoth.
Çağlar said that the capital of all companies in the sector is 9 billion TL, only 2.3 billion TL when the traffic is damaged in three years the sector's capital will be finished, "Why are foreigners financing the bad driver, why do I feel thousands of people financing the bad driver in Turkey?'he looks."
"At this point, we are trying to tell the Treasury our problem," he said.
Following these developments, the ages have not reached the point of weight reduction in the Turkish insurance sector, "they have not yet reached that point."
They expect to invest more in Turkey because in the Netherlands, an average of 6 policies per person fell, while in Turkey 1.3.
So Turkey is a country which will recover the whole world.:
So they haven't given up.
However, even though the company achieves a reasonable profit every year, it leaves the whole profit intact and uses it for the growth of the company.
According to TSB data, premium production in the sector was 40.5 billion TL in 2016, while the first half of this year was 23.1 billion TL with an increase of 12 percent compared to the same period last year.
Caglar said that the sector would not complete the total premium production with 15 percent growth in the year.

The women, the ancestors of the foetus
As a result of fifty years of experience, the British government has seen that our family is loyal and devoted.
The Supreme authorities of the government have acknowledged that this family has been sincerely attached to the British government and has been in great service.
The British government has to be smart and careful about this field planted with its own hands, to investigate everything thoroughly, and to make a careful decision.
While trying to understand the conquest, the organization of the poppy is considered as the starting point, but the forgotten difference is that the foetus is an organization that emerged during the imperialist period and acted with colonial motives.
In my opinion, the 'leading movement' that needs to be addressed in this context is Kadıyan.
In the English commendation at the entrance, he described himself as 'the seedland planted by the hands of the British government', and was the founder of Kadiyyah, Mirza Gulam Ahmed Kadiyi.
Goulam Ahmad, born in Kadiyan, a small town in Punjab, India, said: "on December 1, 1888, God ordered him to take allegiance from his followers and establish a separate community."
Goulam Ahmad went a little further and in 1891, according to the revelation and inspiration he received from Jesus B. He said that Mary died with a death like the other prophets, and that God sent her as the Messiah and the Mahdi, awaited by Christians and Muslims.
According to this, the Messiah awaited by Muslims and Hazrat Mahdi (as) is the same person and this is Mirza Goulam Ahmad Qadiani.
(Encyclopedia of Islam, TDV)
Gulam Ahmad, who wrote books defending oppressed Muslims against Hindu and Christians in India, who came under British rule after the sipahi uprising in 1857, recalled gülen's Portrait of the President of the anti-communism Association in Erzurum and the President of the CIA, who was thought to have been founded by a purely Biblical sage, and who defended Islam against irreligion.
Just like Gülen, Gulam Ahmad's most popular idea by the imperialists is that "Jihad"is a struggle of Muslims with his own self and that if you can live your religion freely, imperialism has no dimension to struggle.
Even if you remember, gülen went one step further and praised the attacks of the Crusaders, who were still vulnerable in our history, in a sermon last year: "it is not too dangerous for the Crusader to invade your country.
Because there are red lines between you and them.
For one thing, they don't attach to your woman, to your daughter.
They don't attach to the temple, the unbound Crusaders!
The idea that Hazrat Mahdi (As) and the Messiah (as) will be the Savior of Islam in their own community, and that the concept of jihad is not only the struggle against nafs, but also the spread of kadiyanism in general and in the field of Education and civil society.
The total number of women in the world, which is said to be more than 2 million, is 1869, the number of countries in which the emergency aid organization called "humanity first" was officially registered as 23.
In addition, 36 hospitals in 12 countries, 650 dispensers in 55 countries, 8 printing presses in Africa, 505 educational institutions in 11 countries and approximately 16,000 mosques around the world are among the data.
Nobel Prize winner Considering that abdussalam was the kadiyani of the Muslim actor, Mahershala Ali, who won the first Oscar, by Sir Zaferullah Khan, President of the United Nations Court of Justice, we can see the depth of the approval of the global powers to the Kadiyani.
Let us note that the women's meeting in England with 30,000 people last week was also polished as a body show.
A brief look at their history is enough to understand that one of their slogans, "love everyone, don't hate anyone", actually wants to say "love your invaders/ colonizers".
All of these organizations are in fact supported as a matter of maturation to expel societies in order to serve colonialism by giving them a gateway to imperialism.

Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will not change soon after slowing economic growth and easing speculation that moving inflation will be an increase.
Bank of England warned that economic growth will continue to "slow" as family income contracted and they kept interest rates constant.
Decision makers at the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6% to keep interest rates at 0.25%, prompting fewer members this month after slow economic growth weakened support.
In a quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its growth forecast to 1.7% in 2017, 1.6% in 2018, and warned that households ' incomes will continue to shrink with inflation still expected to rise to around 3% in the spring.
However, interest increases have signaled that Brexit's inflation is needed to rein in the next few years, and he said borrowing costs may remain in the financial markets to increase more than expected.

The Bank will end the periodic funding plan that offers cheap financing to banks starting next February, but it expects more than £ 15 billion (a total of £ 115 billion) to be submitted within the framework of the plan, The Bank said.
Minutes after the interest rate decision, the bank said: "in the central estimation of MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) continues to slow in the short term as the contraction of domestic real incomes continues to be a burden on consumption."
Interest rates," monetary policy "a little contraction" may be necessary to alleviate inflation, and market expectations "a little higher" will be emphasized.

Growth will probably remain 0.3% in the third quarter, but the Bank will begin to increase slightly towards the end of the year.
While the Bank says contraction will worsen before it recovers, the latest inflation report leaves little cheer to households hit by rising inflation and small salary increases.
The bank said monetary policy could not "prevent" the shooting of revenues in the next few years, but expects the salaries to recover "substantially" towards the end of three-year forecasts.
The rise in demand for British goods as a result of weak pound will support the economy by balancing some of the declining consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after the shock, which led to a head-down EU referendum, dropped interest rates to 0.25% last August.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to have a full effect on prices and the economy.
Prior to the Bank's most recent interest rate decision, there was a rising demand for a rising interest rate, which increased pressure on the forced households and three policymakers called for a 0.5% increase in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in July, but the bank said it was expected and will increase once again in the coming months.
According to their 2% targets, the bank said the vaccination is about the "completely" weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director at Coreco mortgage brokers, said: "given recent declines in swap rates, the mortgage market will become even more competitive once again, while lenders have a demand to do business and close the year in a positive way.

NHS will write controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
In the Supreme Court, patients will be able to receive 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment starting in September after a fight to finance the drug in the NHS.
NHS UK has announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken prior to sex, will be available to approximately 10,000 people through a 3-year pre-trial, with an estimated risk of infection in high-risk individuals.
The Supreme Court's decision last year agreed to finance the trial after the Appeal Court's approval. The ruling said that the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP, despite allegations of funding by local authorities.
The move, announced on Thursday, was welcomed by the NHS President Simon Stevens as a 'new and serious intervention', while National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a 'turning point'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to register the Public and will be fully implemented by April 2018 throughout England with the participation of more clinics in October.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep) a series of HIV drugs that reduce the risk of HIV infection before sex.
Trials showed that prep significantly reduced HIV transmission among those at risk for infection.
Prep before sex means that a person has enough drugs to prevent HIV infection from settling in his body.
This type of medication can be taken every day or almost two hours before sex.
Those eligible for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transsexual men, and HIV-positive partners who are not successfully treated.
Clinics will determine appropriate participants who will consent to the trial from men, women, transgender individuals, and from unknown individuals whose partners are controlled by anti-retroviral treatment.
People who live in the UK and are registered with a GP will also be able to register for potential participation in participating local sexual health clinics.
The program will hold £ 10 million and the NHS has signed an agreement to provide medicines this week with a UK international tender.
The trial was designed to assess the full potential of prep by collecting clinical evidence on how the prep was targeted, carried out, and applied on a large scale.
Mr. Stevens said: "this new and serious intervention will contribute to large-scale and increasingly successful efforts in the prevention of HIV.
This is another milestone in thirty years of development to overcome one of humanity's major health problems.'
Deborah gold, Head of the National AIDS trust, said: "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
If those in need and at risk are targeted correctly, Prep offers the possibility of transforming the HIV epidemic in the UK.
From September onwards, people at high risk for HIV will have access to a new, powerful tool that is truly personal-controlled and not open to negotiation with a spouse through this NHS-funded experiment in the UK, which will lead to the recovery of many lives.
We welcome this announcement warmly.'
Ian green, Head of Terrence Higgins trust, said: "the priority should be to ensure that the experiment is presented rapidly across the country and that no one at risk of HIV is left behind.
Since prep test drugs are now available, we are on the way to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV.'
Sharon Hodgson, Minister of public health of shadow, said: "We welcome the start of the prep trial, and we are late with months of delays, and then with the government's footstep.
Evidence shows how transducer this drug can be as part of our view of HIV prevention and the end of the life-changing infection.
The experiment will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of prep.
It is now important that this experiment be offered as quickly as possible across the country to protect people who are exposed to HIV and to bring us one step closer to the end of HIV spread in society.

Living luxurious life: the suspended floors and smart design numbers have turned this little Earl court apartment into a spacious house.
Former Banker Joanne Leigh, who was passionate about property renovations, moved from a spacious house in Knightsbridge to the apartment at Earls Court in 2014.
The sleek Queen is proof of a new design on the first floor of a mother-style tarpaulin and convinces Joanne to pack her bags.
"Before that, I lived in a much larger area in Knightsbridge with my ex."Joanne says.
"I was looking for something that was equivalent to my price.
The apartment at Earl court was shown to me and they had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with him and made an offer that day."
After the first sight, the 1,000 square feet circle was renewed from head to toe.
Initially, it was a one-bedroom and complex-planned property; you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom. Joanne wanted to add a storage space and a suspended floor to take maximum advantage of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows and lots of light.
That was my condition."he says.
For this purpose, Notting Hill-based architecture and Design Studio Duck & shed hired Erfan Azadi to take advantage of a 12.5 ft ceiling and create a place not only for a building but also for Joanne to live in.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two areas in a row, so the architectural challenge was to create a suspended floor where you could stand in it.
Erfan had to think creatively about the matter.
"The steel skeleton is quite complex."he explains.
"We had to adjust the gaps so that they could pile up without leaning down on each other.
This was not only to build a simple platform, but also steel would be so inclined that they would be at the right height according to the top or bottom function."
This arrangement also brought many additional DRAM, allowing Erfan to get two full-length rooms on top of each other.
The old copper light window, taken from Retrouvius for the suspended Floor, looks down to the spectacular living area below.
Mirrored gold furniture, Silver highlights and the old-fashioned Serge Mouille lighting all define the style of the design.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of space, space and light.
The mirrors placed on either side of the short corridor make it look longer.
The mirrored Ranger panel in the kitchen gives a window feel to another room.
The mirrored units in the training provide all of Joanne's cutlery and storage space.
The beauty of the living room, which creates a more magnificent perception of space, is to close the kitchen when it is not in use.
The kitchens are not new.
The original thing is that there's a garage door that can be lifted up.
Erfan, steel-reinforced polished MDF door, "we used some engineering in this."he explains.
"There's a balance weight, so when you push the door up, it's really easy to slip."
Joanne has gained an additional 16 square meters, an extra bedroom and an improved session plan with the wise use of the space and storage space.
"At the end of the day, you're going to sell a session, or your property is valued."erfan says . 
"As an Iptidai, a realtor will enter and perform a calculation on the basis of the session area."
They managed to use high quality materials that give the area a luxurious look while increasing the ground area.
"Materials are objects that you touch, so they help you to establish emotional bonds at home."he says
"At home, you don't fall in love with the power lines on the wall.
They're important, but they don't vibrate the strings of your heart."
This is proof that an apartment can be transformed from a standard to something quite spectacular through good design and an improved square meter.
Actually, like Joanne, you can choose not to leave.

Brothers fight for $ 500 million worth of property Empire
Forty years after the dynasty of the Italian families, two brothers are fighting for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million.
Former director of Carlton football club and Contractor Colin de Lutis lives three doors away from his younger brother Paul who gave himself to the Supreme Court about how to share property and business assets in a farmhouse in Tourok.
Paul wanted to quit his family business since 2014, but the High Court had a hard time arguing about fragmentation.
Their mother Anna and brothers Smith Street are the Companions of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars that have been accumulated since a store in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco jeans and raised it to a chain of 160 retail outlets.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was invested in property and his portfolio now includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento construction sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller Apartments and shopping malls in the suburbs.
As part of an agreement with their deceased father, Colin (described by Paul as an "important driving force and a dominant personality" in the Lutis family) has two-thirds of the company's assets and one-third of Paul.
A court case says it means Colin has $ 316 million worth of property and Paul has $ 176 million worth of property.
Dividing the property and the cash for Paul is a contentious issue.
In his first sworn statement to the court in 2015, he wrote: "the divisions proposed by Colin left him with the property i always consider to be the best."
After many failed mediation last Friday, the first high court hearing was held.
The brothers and sisters are also fighting about who will control the current job; Paul claims that Colin left him out of the job.
Colin argues that this is not true, but he blames Paul for incompetent management of some property.
Colin says he hopes to settle the dispute in an affidavit in the beginning.
"My Italian roots dictate that the family is the most important priority."he wrote.
Hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and outstanding lawyers such as Allan Myers, QC and Senior Legal Counsel held by both sides, are on the rise in litigation costs by companies including Deloitte, pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer.
Mrs. de lutis and her late husband Luigi, from the late 1950s, were a family of Italian immigrants who operated grocery stores and delicatessens and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
Colin, who opened the family's first pair of jeans Shop, had pledged his property to buy Collingwood property.
"In my last years in high school, Paul says he founded Westco there when he was a little boy (about 10 years old).
Anna de lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hope to leave their property in a friendly way to their sons.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court., "he wrote.
The other two brothers mark and Luke are no longer part of the lutis group of companies; Colin said that when he quit, mark was paid $ 10 million, and Luke paid $ 26 million.
Paul said that both Luke and mark were dissatisfied with the circumstances of their financial break-up."
According to a biography of Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the television star, in 2015, Colin tried not to draw attention to the fact that he was a former member of the Board of Directors of an AFL club.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de lutis and his lawyers on Friday.
I can't say much. he answered.
"It was very sad that my brother Paul chose to sue me and dragged our family's name to the courts., "he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court application that he was trying to meet his brother's demands.
"Our Father, Paul and I would not want to be in conflict. he said, "We are still hopeful about the solution."
This hope seems to be lost on Friday.
Colin, "the problem will be resolved by the courts in the near future., "he wrote.
Trump's new special pen is planning to limit the President's media diet.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do that.
If so, it'il be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House special Pen will restrict the flow of information to President Trump (including news media reports) in hopes of keeping the boss more stable.
Some small information from Reporter Josh dawsey:
"The White House's new Special Pen, John F. When Kelly met senior staff on her first day of work, she outlined a fundamental problem President Donald Trump was planning to solve about the White House: getting bad information into the hands of the President.
Kelly told the staff that the information should flow through itself, whether on paper or in brief, because the president could make better decisions when good information was given.
Kelly's diagnosis makes a lot of sense, but others have tested the media diet and tried to tame Trump and failed.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and he's in the White House now, and he's still in good shape.
"If candidate Trump was upset that he was not a fair participant in the media, it was productive to show him that he found a fair place in persuasive media outlets." quoth.
According to six campaign officials at the time, Tara palmeri from Politíko, the key to controlling Trump's Twitter habit was to ensure that personal media consumption contained a steady stream of praise., "he wrote.
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit is "under control" at any time is ludicrous.
Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't know, for example, that Trump's tweets would be much more provocative without their intervention.
We'il probably never know anything about tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his staff were able to get him out of danger a few times, then his efforts were valuable.
But no one could prevent Trump from constantly stirring up controversy.
Part of the problem was that the White House was competing factions, people who tried to advance their own agenda with the materials they offered to Trump (they could be reliable or unreliable), and put forward their own world views.
In May, politico reported the tendency of counselors to communicate suspected information to the President strategically throughout this whole story.
Reporter Shane Goldmacher explained in detail::
"Current and ex-Trump officials say that Trump has reacted violently to negative clippings from the press, especially to leaks that have a bad effect, and is intrigued to find out where they originate.
At the end of February, someone's President, Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson's site GotNews.com this happened when special Pen Assistant Katie Walsh made a hard copy of an article in the White House accusing him of being "the source behind a series of leaks."
It was not of any importance that Johnson had been banned from Twitter for harassment, or that he had not presented any concrete evidence, or that he had been charged with false charges in the past and had returned from them.
Trump read the article and started asking staff questions about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the then special Pen Reince Priebus and White House staff Secretary Rob Porter were "trying to place a system that handles and documents the documents that Trump received."
How did that work out?
Kelly's trying to do the same thing in three months.
Perhaps he will emerge as a more effective Manager than Priebus, but Trump is still on his own initiative and his assistants are still racing for influence.
These unchanging factors will make Kelly's mission very difficult.

Travelers crossed the ditch, went back to the rich neighborhood
Some of the richest landlords in the Western Midlands are fighting again with ambitious travelers across the ditch dug by the Council to reclaim the area outside their own estates.
Travelers parked their 20 Caravans out of a so-called 'zengin Mahallesi', where Solihull was on-site.
They returned after being fired in May, bringing horses, babies and a full load of wagons, not to be intimidated by the ditch that the Council dug to cut their flocks.
The cleverly moving group found a space in the defence, leaking their vehicles through a roadway from a part of the barricade.
Angry residents criticized the Solihull Council by saying that this was "useless in solving the problem".
An anonymous resident said: "they came there Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones to passersby.
The Council should be ashamed of their actions because they are useless in solving the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were sent, and now they come back.
There's more coming last night, probably more coming today."
He added: "the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with the long-withdrawal decisions that have been taken to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Street, and I'm not happy to continue paying my taxes while the Council can't stop it.'
"As a joke, we saw that the last group of travelers had just left, and we were immediately devastated by a new group.
Their numbers increased this time, and they even saw a horse grazing in the parking lot.'
A woman from the Solihull Council said: "we are aware that there is an unauthorized camp on Streetsbrook Street, and we are initiating legal proceedings to send them from there as soon as possible.
In order to support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents of the region call 101 to report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police.
This will help bring out a picture of the situation in order for the Court to take into account when we present our case to the court.'

Italy stiffens NGO's approach to migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue if they fail to comply with the new rules that affect their operations.
"If NGOs fail to comply with the new Statute, it will be hard to see that they continue to operate." quoth.
The warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a boat run by the German aid Agency Jugend Rekett, suspected that its crew were actively cooperating with human traffickers to facilitate illegal immigration.
The aid Agency, which has only been active for a year, refused to comment on the contents of the detailed charges filed against them by Italian Prosecutor Ambrogio Carosio.
"Saving human life for us is our most important priority, and it will be, so we are very sorry that we can't work in the search and rescue area right now."
"We can only make an assessment of the charges currently being made after we have collected all the information and made an assessment of the situation."
Italian authorities have been watching Jugend rettet's boat since October.
The crew suspects that they have taken a full of rubber boots delivered directly to them by human traffickers, and that they have allowed them to escape with boats for re-use.
According to the Prosecutor's files published by the Italian media, at least one such meeting took place, allegedly 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast.
The crew is unwilling to disregard the authority of Italian Coast Guard, overseeing rescue operations in the region, rather than humanitarian efforts.
According to the Charter, boats like Iuventa had to have an Italian police officer on board who clearly monitored their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in the search and rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the Statute: save the Children, Malta-based MOAS and Pro-activa open arms from Spain.
The last one said on Tuesday that the new rules were unnecessary but acceptable because they would not cause any "serious change" in their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign are doctors (MSF) who do not recognize the Nobel Prize-winning Organization.
Meanwhile, minniti said, the sharp decline in the number of immigrants arriving in Italy following the rescue in the past week indicates that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local governors are fruitful.
The minister said: "We have recently begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel."
This month, the Libyan Governor announced plans to meet more about economic development initiatives and to take measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving Chad, Niger and Mali hoping to reach Europe.

Michelle Carter was sentenced to death for messages that encouraged Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through messages and telephone conversations.
Michelle Carter, 20 years old now, will take 15 months of his sentence behind bars and five years of constitutional eviction.
In June, Carter was convicted of the murder of Conrad Roy, who killed himself on July 13, 2014.
Mr. Roy's father said at Thursday's hearing: "my family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to be released to the open road of the procession.
Although he faced a maximum of 20 years of imprisonment, his legal team argued that he and Mr. Roy were suffering from mental illness.
Carter, wearing red trousers and a cream blouse, was punished with old eyes, hands clamped, and eyes facing the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy." quoth.
He ended his life to heal his own.
He didn't take responsibility." quoth.
"He never showed remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said, "it was a terrible situation where he was completely remorseful." quoth.
However, judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not see any significant impact on the actions of his age, his level of maturity, and even his mental illness.
A prosecutor read a statement by Mr. Roy's mother Lynn Roy: "one day there is no mourning for the loss of my beloved Son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I got over everything. I'm trying to be with her sisters with all the pain we're gonna carry forever. he said.
Mr. Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that the fact that he would never attend his brother's wedding or that he would never be able to attend to his children is still in his mind.
"It is a pain that will always be with me for the rest of my life." quoth.
It seems that the case will be a case of trial because there is no Massachusetts law that criminalizes telling a person to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 when Mr. Roy was found dead in a vehicle in 2014 from carbon monoxide poisoning.
The case attracted National attention when Carter revealed that his text messages encouraged him to end his own life.
When she was on vacation with her family, she sent several messages two weeks before her death: "hang yourself, jump out of a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are a lot of ways."
In moments before his suicide, he wrote, "you have to do this, Conrad," and all you have to do is turn on the generator and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter wanted to draw attention to Mr. Roy's death, instructing him not to be allowed to benefit from this case through the press.
The case divided the legal opinion.
Amanda Knox, who was convicted of killing her British roommate in Italy in 2007, was among the few who defended Carter before being acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox (30) published an article in the Los Angeles Times saying, "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and assistance, not jail."

I believe that by increasing our resistance to shocks with a little reform, we will place Turkey on a growth trend of over 5 percent.
I told you months ago.
The worst is left behind.
Gradually, our energy is no longer to those areas, but to the extent that our energy is to grow inclusive and to the reforms that will enable employment growth...

Audi Will Change 850,000 Diesel Vehicles While The Car Manufacturers Are Facing A Backlash
One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW announced that it will offer software upgrades to more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman of the Board believes that BMW has more intelligent options than driving restrictions, referring to European cities, including Munich, where BMW is headquartered (where diesel vehicles are considered to be banned or restricted).
Daimler said on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe would be modified to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the firms described these moves as recall.
European Automobile manufacturers strongly encouraged the use of diesel cars to help meet carbon dioxide emissions in Europe and the United States.
However, nitrogen oxides released by diesel engines are considered cancer-causing and can cause asthma.
The cost of the equipment that automotive companies need to install to neutralize the smoke generated by diesel cars is increasing, making it difficult for cars to remain competitive.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has been accused of spoiling powerful auto companies and ignoring the complaints of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen's mistakes, disguising the device known as a misleading device and adjusting emissions to conform to regulations when an automobile is tested and relaxing it in normal driving conditions.
Many Volkswagen executives were indicted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former Head of thermodynamics was arrested in Germany in Audi's engine development department.
Former Director Zaccheo Giovanni pamio, an Italian and therefore not protected from extradition, may be prosecuted in the United States.
Earlier this year Audi had been dragged into a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen; authorities had extended the United States-based investigation after accusing Audi of installing a system to avoid emissions rules in Europe.
Audi's involvement in the investigation may be severe to Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer, Volkswagen's profits have a disproportionate share.
Jumping fish every time you see
Turkish Neurosurgical Society President Prof. Dr. Yusuf Şükrü çağlar, not to be sure of its depth, 2 meters in shallow places did not jump fishing warning.
Every year thousands of people are at risk of stroke because of their neck fracture and spinal cord injury.
Neck fractures are most common in the fifth or sixth vertebrae.
The characteristic of fractures at this level in the arm and leg muscles as well as respiratory muscles that affect the nerves feeding.
Prof. Dr. "In this type of accidents, our most valuable organ in the neck spinal cord region, broken by the spine is cut or squeezed out of function."
"The wrong first aid in spinal injuries not only increases the damage to the survivors, but also leads to death," he said.
Dive into the water, ranks fourth in spinal cord injuries.
The average age of the injured is 20-29 and the majority is male.
Prof. Dr. The ages said, "fish in the water that cannot be seen inside should not be skipped."
"No matter how well you dive, you may experience a serious injury."
Prof. Dr. The ages also reminded me of:
Depending on the level of the spinal cord where the injury leads to injury while fishing, paralysis of arms and legs can occur at varying degrees.
You may know swimming, but water can be tricky.
The place you look deep may be shallow.
In the US and Australia, the warning signs placed on the sea coast reduced by 70 percent in cases of diving into shallow water.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar, "in Turkey, although 28 provinces are located on the coast of the sea, unfortunately, there is not even a single warning sign in places outside Istanbul."
"Information light or information panels should be kept conspicuously in the beaches and pools under the health Directorate, schools and social awareness project of each province in relation to these types of accidents," he said.
Turkish Neurosurgery Society head of spinal and peripheral nerve surgery surgery Prof. Dr. Kadir kotil suggested that in case of injury,:
112 should be called first at the time of the incident.
The neck should be kept as fixed as possible, should not be moved, should be identified with a hard collar.
The airway must be provided and the patient must be placed on the opposite side for drainage of water from the lungs.
It shouldn't be held in the legs and stalked to empty the water.
The deformity of the patient's neck should not be tried to be corrected.
The neck vertebrae may have broken.
However, if the spinal cord has not yet been damaged, an inappropriate position to be given to the neck during first aid and patient transport may cause broken bone fragments to press on the spinal cord and cut and damage the spinal cord.
Rehn also said There was no reason to postpone negotiations on fishing and foreign policy, as the dispute over border traffic between Croatia and Slovenia has been resolved.

Provence lavender is under threat of climate change
It turned into a symbol of Provence in Southern France, but there is a warning that it is under threat of climate change.
Lavender is experiencing a decline in drought-like conditions and disease-bearing insects, causing a great deal of headaches to scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at credepam at Provence-based agriculture Research Institute, said: "lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which brings much less in spring and mostly in autumn.
This affects the life of the lavender.
In addition, there is a small auger beetle, a leaf pest that transfers micro-bacteria, and there is a lot of them in very dry weather."
And many things are in danger.
For example, lavender oil for perfume and cosmetics, as well as for vacationers, is a great way to pursue lavender oil.
Eric chaisse said: "we have smaller, less developed or less weak heads, while we need to have very long plant heads with a few broad flowers.

Journalist murder underscores the growing threat in Mexico
The Weekly Riodoce's staff often meet on Wednesdays to review their latest corruption, corruption officers and plans to include in the newspaper the endless drug wars in the state of Sinaloa.
But on this day, they came together to talk about their safety in the shadow of their own tragedy.
They were told that it was important for them to change their routines.
Two senior journalists see what makes them feel safer: bringing their children together to the Office, the target of a hand grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the blackboard in front of the room: the opponents, the neutrinos, the allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column; no evidence is needed, perceptions and inner voices are enough.
Drug traffickers, politicians, business people, journalists suspected of connecting the Government or the cartel to the salary, the bad guy who made a list of jobs dangerous to write in a newspaper full of Mexico's Chaos.
According to the journalists Protection Committee, at least 25 people since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 have been under federal Protection and at least seven have been killed in seven States this year after attacks and threats.
Among the last ones are the editorial directors and the Riodoce Founding Partner Javier Valdez Cardenas.
Valdez, "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and become a journalist."he writes in one of his many books on narcotics violence.
His absence is deeply felt, but his presence is everywhere hanging on the front of Riodoceís building with the word "justice", a large photograph showing Valdez's middle finger; two reporters in his 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts showing his smile, his glasses face and his Panama Hat.
The workshop takes place two months after her death; reporters talk about joint traumas, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal Prosecutor was created in 2010 to handle journalist cases, only two of them were prosecuted, according to the journalists Protection Committee.
As in most of the thousands of murders committed to drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
In riodoce, they insist on addressing violence in Sinaloa, even though their hearts are broken, but the ground is more deceptive.
Without information about the killers, without justice, security is very little work, says Ibarra.
"It's stupid to spend my time in this workshop."he says.
"As long as we don't know why, you don't trust anyone."
On the morning of May 15th, Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan, the State Capital.
The Red Toyota Corolla was able to drive only a few blocks before being stopped by two men, forcibly removed from his vehicle and shot 12 times, presumably for the name of his twelfth River.
The man with the gun drove away in his car and hit the car nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
His wife and two adult children left.
Rumors tend to circulate freely in Culiacan.
But there's nothing but silence about Valdez.
After Guzman's arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battle zones in the country as rival groups fought to fill the void.
Never mind that every day on the street in Sinaloa, one or many people are shot and killed, or that the cemetery is filled with more mausoleums than many fancy, two-story houses to live with.
For a minute, forget the "calm" situation that only one cartel controls the precious ports and routes of drug trafficking to the United States.
Although Valdez was deeply aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), the founding partner and Director of Riodoce, was convicted of failing to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was an interview with Damas Lopez, the leader of one of Guzman's rival cartel bands in battle with his sons.
This article may have upset sons; the possible gang members have purchased every copy of the RAID as soon as it was delivered to the newsstand.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the confiscation of another newspaper with the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as a turning point in Mexican violence against journalists.
He was alive for so long, his friends and colleagues assumed he'd always be there.
He was an experienced journalist in Noroeste in 2013 when he joined five colleagues selling $50 shares in Riodoce's Discovery.
"It was impossible to do journalism without mentioning the narcotics issue," Bojorquez said in Sinaloa.
Over time, the newspaper gained fame with bold and honest news and increased sales and advertising.
Reporters loved to publish life-saving research without fear of censorship, and the readers got caught up in a broadcast where they could read stories that no one dared to communicate.
Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for reporting in Latin America eight years after its foundation.
The same year Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for encouraging me not to leave a trail of drugs wherever the tip of the Mexican drug story came from.
He admitted he was clearly afraid.
During the CPJ awards, he said, "I want to continue living."yes," he said.
In an interview with Rompeviento TV, drug trafficking in Sinaloa was "a way of life."
"As a journalist, you must accept your duty. Either that, or you play the fool.
He said to me, " what were you doing in the face of so many deaths?.. Why didn't you tell me what was going on?'I don't want to be prompted."
Riodoce's staff misses Valdez, the blasphemy Joker, his generous friends in his embrace and advice, his teachers who know how to survive...
They trusted his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He used to go to the bar opposite the Office called El Guayabo and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask: is His love for his routines a fall?
His death forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and survive.
"They don't like it if you deal with their women, their children, their clean jobs, their secret aircrafts they use to transport drugs."
Bojorquez said, "these things were beyond the limit." quoth.
The result, even at the best time, was a high degree of self-esteem and self-preservation.
Trusting your own instincts.
If it smells bad, stay away.
Riodoce editor-in-chief Andrés Villarreal said, "smell is a deceptive sensation... and what happened to Javier happened." quoth.
He and others say that old rules do not apply in Sinaloa; they do not apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that host a toxic mixture of profitable trafficking routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials...
The floor is changing all the time.
In the room where riodocene staff met for security training, no cell phone was allowed; days ago, it was revealed that only government-sold spy software was used to spy journalists and activists in Mexico.
Two police officers outside wanted to get rid of 104 degrees (40 degrees) in the shade of a tree.
They were assigned by the state government to protect riodoce's Office in a four-storey building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Semi-serious, semi-serious, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were one of the 50 percent of the cops that the governor himself said were untrustworthy.
Reporters have been in the mountainous countryside, where drug gangs actually control it for months.
In this week's issue Riodoce examines three main stories.
Former great Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez had his brother's murder in Sinaloa.
In addition, there was a disclosure of government spending concentrated on the Governor's country.
And one block from the D. A.'s office, there was a group kidnapping at Culiacan's most expensive restaurant.
There was no official explanation of who was kidnapped or how, so when it came time to write what everyone in the city knew: the restaurant was the Favourite of both drug smugglers and authorities.
A reporter learned from official records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who was a member of the Corporate revolutionary party (pri) in the administration, which dominated almost every level of politics in the last century.
Many pri governors have recently been accused of corruption in sensational events.
Villareal asked the reporter to write about the events that took place at that scene, including the escape of one of Guzman's sons from a military RAID.
They only read months ago, looking at Valdez's corner for the best source of information on abduction.
Because of its thin structure, Villareal (46), dubbed "El flaco," we already knew what was going on before." quoth.
"All communication channels with our sources are now interrupted."
The staff turned into activists in the name of the press, and Valdez's office is being reused as a warehouse for banners and stickers protesting journalist murders.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few banners and went to the demonstration the next morning for another journalist in the local Prosecutor's office.
Salvador adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the state of Michoacan in the West.
A burnt body was found, and DNA tests show that it's official.
Journalists across the country have expressed their thoughts loudly by writing "help to the press" on the streets and buildings in organised protests.
Today, Director Bojorquez is trying to provide international support for justice in the Valdez case, far from Washington.
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and murdering them for telling the truth.
From that day on, he wanted to be assigned to a task other than to do the government news, thinking that his anger was undermining his neutrality.
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico have been "surrounded" by organised crime, accomplices official officials, and a society that does not care.
In his last book entitled "narco-journalism," he wrote that journalists were killed not only by drug gangs but also by politicians and security forces in cooperation with organised crime.
Media Observer Group Articulo 19 linked more than half of the attacks on journalists last year to police and officials.
Ramirez said, "you die in Mexico because they want to silence you." quoth.
The murders clearly had a cold shower effect.
No one remembers the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in Tamamipas, the northern border State.
His body was found with a note said to have been signed by the zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my news."
A computer keyboard and earpiece are stacked next to the severed head.
In Chihuahua, northern border Province, some publications, such as El Norte, have preferred to close after the death of Reporter Miroslava breach in March.
The others continue as El Manana from Nuevo Laredo did after their director was killed in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez called out to drug cartels with the following headline on the front page: "what do you want from us?"
Some journalists fled their own states, even from the country.
It's a Horoscope decision.
It's hard to get a job in exile, and they're still crawling the streets waiting for danger.
Sometimes, three months after fleeing Veracruz, four women in 2015 were captured as evidenced by photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was murdered in an apartment in Mexico City.
This is a dance made every day with high-risk decisions for those who stay behind and continue to work.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, says he was afraid to do drug trafficking.
"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter." quoth.
At midnight on a recent Saturday night, Riodoce editorial Directors sat on the sidewalk outside the office and started to steal the phones at the same time as they were preparing to finish the last issue.
A series of armed clashes, including rival gangs and security forces near Mazatlan, a seaside resort, caused 19 confirmed deaths.
As promised in a series of cartel messages around, the war continued to escalate.
They put the news on Riodoce's website via mobile phones on the sidewalk.
The front page would have to be changed the next day.
The sirens are buzzing nearby, there's another gun in the vicinity.
Bojorquez quickly looked at the police officers who were on guard to see if they were on alert.
If they were afraid, they wouldn't show it.
Under the huge portrait of the new founders of his Newspapers, his middle finger was on display for the entire Sinaloa to see, and Riodoce's staff were following his footsteps.
"How can you think of closing it," Bojorquez said, "on the day Javier was killed, when the trainee asked me to send him out to make a news story on the street?"
The dinosaur used camouflage to avoid his enemies.
It looks like a statue at first glance, but it's a terrible one.
Researchers have now explained that the first signs of an incredible Rhino-sized creature, found by a Canadian miner, are very well preserved, and experts describe it as the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.
It was so well preserved that they could understand that the scal skin was reddish brown and they could say that it had a troubled past.
The report in current biology described it as one of the best preserved dinosaur species found and one of the best dinosaur species in the world.
The fossil is a newly discovered nodosor species that lived 110 million to 112 million years ago from the middle of the Cretaceous period.
The extraordinarily well-preserved state has turned the researchers who described it as 'really wonderful'.
Plant-eating Armored, the best preserved fossil of its kind, according to reports from National Geographic.
Shawn funk was found on March 21, 2011 in North Alberta in Canada digging the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray.
According to the rock around him, he hit something that looked strange and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil unearthed was sent to the Royal Tyrell Paleontology museum.
They spent the next 6 years figuring out the wild animal from within 2500 pounds (1100 kg) of soil.
After this intense work, the completed result is now ready to be revealed.
Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrell Museum, where the creature is displayed, said: "if you close your eyes a little, you can almost believe you're asleep.' quoth.
'One of the most beautiful in the history of Science and the best-preserved dinosaur species, the dinosaur's Mona Lisa will pass as.'
Researchers examined the skin and found that even though it was covered with armor and looked like a walking tank, this plant eater was probably facing a serious threat from meat-eating dinosaurs.
He used red and white camouflage to hide from dinosaur predators, which are heavily armored, and used a protective technique known as counter-shadowing, which is also used by today's animals.
Experts say it has been hunted by larger dinosaurs, allowing them to blend in better and escape their enemies.
This is the first time a 110-million-year-old alien from the family of nodosor has appeared in the headlines on May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrell Paleontology Museum.
The researchers have now completed their work and have named the wild animal borealopelta Markmitchelli, dedicated to Museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of the teams that spend more than 7000 hours trying to uncover it.
The species has been extraordinarily preserved. Mitchell and the international team of scientists have made it possible for them to document the pattern of stamps and the body armor.
They discovered contra shading, a common Defense method in the animal world, which means that the upper part of the creature is darker than the lower part of the animal.
Although contrast shading is common, the findings are surprising because the size of Borealopelta exceeds the size of today's live contrast shading animals.
This means that the dinosaur has been hunted by the flesh-eating dinosaurs, and that evolution prefers to hide as a method of survival.
But the most modern animals (such as deer, zebras or armadillos) that use contra shading are much smaller and much smaller than prey, which means that this nodosor has faced a serious challenge to survive.
"Strong hunting for a giant, heavily armed animal shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators in Cretaceous can be," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal for clues about his life, including preserved intestinal contents, to find out what he ate at his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur dies, it falls into a river and drifts into the sea, where it sinks into the back of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida was today, and probably rivers and oceans spread more inland than they were now.
"The nodosor is completely covered and protected from scaly skin, and it's really remarkable that the original shape of the animal is preserved in a 3D way," Brown said." quoth.
'The result is that the animal looks pretty much the same today as it looks in the early Cretaceous.
You don't need much imagination to rebuild it; if you cut your eyes a little, you can almost believe you're asleep.'
The Cretaceous was when the giant teropods, the meat-rattling dinosaurs standing on two feet, wandered around the globe.
Tyrannosaurus Rex, the King of all, lived millions of years after the Armored dinosaur Borealoptala, which could have been hunted by some of the imposing ancestors of Tyrannosaurus Rex.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, a monster of 38 ft (11.5 m) and weighing 6 tons.
The latest findings of the current biology magazine scientists believe that Borealopelta was dragged into the sea after he died and mummified in mud.
The creature was discovered by Shawn funk on March 21, 2011 in North Alberta, Canada, while digging the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray.
According to the Museum, this is the best preserved armored dinosaur, including leather and armor, and complete from the nose to the hip.
The creature is on average 18 ft. (five meters) and a weight of up to 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
There are two 20-inch long antlers coming out of their shoulders.
Researchers believe that this armored weed circulates cumbersome in the western Canadian area until it drifts into the open sea by a river overflowing.
But the dinosaur's underwater tomb kept its armor in perfect detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular species are so well preserved that the pieces of skin still cover the bumps of the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greskko writes for National Geographic, such a preservation is as rare as winning a lottery.
The more I look at him, the more amazing he is.
Fossilized leather pieces still cover all the layers of neckline that are at point in the skull of the dinosaur.
His right front leg is lying next to him, with five fingers pointing up.

"Seniority" event in the Turkish army
Dear readers, at the high military council meeting the other day, very interesting decisions were taken especially in terms of the Naval Forces.
The commander of this force, not an Admiral, he was appointed Vice Admiral.
It's practically unprecedented in our army.
And how did that happen?
The commander of the force, Admiral Bülent Bostanoglu, had already completed his term, he would have retired...
And it happened.
Now it was time for the command of Veysel Kösel, the only oramiral.
Veysel Pasha, who had been a victim of kumpas in the past and who had been under arrest for a while, was supposed to be the commander of the regular seniority.
But the government didn't want it.
In a nutshell, if we start from the top of the Navy, the commanders 1, 3, 4 and 5 were not promoted.
In this case, the Marine Corps was the only one left.
He was supposed to be brought to the vacant office: Admiral Oremiral and Vizsel Kösel, the Naval Commander at number two.
And what happened after that?
In sixth place, Adnan ozbal was appointed by the government.
Now look at this table!
Oramiral or Veysel kösele is standing there, but instead he is appointed a lower-ranking commander!
A senior is being put in charge of your seniority.
I wonder what will happen next.
An Admiral who is superior to rank, does not serve under the command of a lieutenant general who is without rank.
He can't take orders from her.
In this case, Veysel kösel will not endure this hurtful situation, and if he is not retired, he will resign today or tomorrow.
This is already the hurtful message given to him by the government: "goodbye, Veysel Pasha!"
Yesterday I wrote this article in the afternoon of the news that he resigned, but the situation has not been officially announced yet.
Let's look at this again!
The Government opposed Veysel kösel for one or more reasons, did not want to, forced him to resign and replaced him with the 6th command. he brought a next coramirali and damaged the traditional "seniority" mentality of our army.
There is absolutely politics involved, but we do not know behind the scenes.
Maybe if someone tells us about it soon, we'il all learn it together!
Dear readers, I tried to explain the above very briefly, especially in the Turkish army seniority event is very important.
Not just rank.
For Example, Harp School 10. next up, officer 11. he's more seniority than the one who's in line.
He is more senseless than the first rank promoted to general.
We experienced concrete examples of this seniority event in the war of Independence.
GARP front Commander Ismet Pasha...
There are two armies at your disposal.
Army and 2. Army.
We have come to 1922, our armies will carry out the great attack and fire the Greek army.
At this stage, there are valuable names expected to be assigned to the army command.
One Is Refet (Bele) Pasha.
He is offered an army command, but he says, "Ismet is seniority from me, I can't go under his command."
Another name is Jacob Shevki (Subaşı) Pasha.
Atatürk was born in 1881 at the kocakasım ward of Salonika, in..
He is a valuable and senior commander who has been involved in various wars, he loves and cares about, he calls him "my master".
In 1919, he was captured with the soldiers and civilian Turkish intellectuals and driven to Malta by the British.
On his return to the country he is reluctant about the army command and says the same thing: "the commander of the Western Front is senseless to me, I can't take orders from him."
However, Ataturk convinces him to ask and Yakup Şevki Pasha accepts the command of one of our two armies.
The third is a very colorful name...
Ali Ihsan (Sabis) Pasha.
A soldier who speaks a lot, who constantly criticizes.
Iraq, the Caucasus, Iran and a commander who fought on various fronts.
He was exiled to Malta by the British, and he fled from there and came to Ankara via Kuşadası.
Ali Ihsan paşa says the same thing when he is offered army command: "I cannot fight under Ismet, who is without seniority"...
But he's being persuaded...
However, after he started his mission, he constantly discusses with Ismet Pasha, the commander of the GARP front, and makes the military uneasy...
And shortly before the great attack, he was dismissed and retired, replacing the bearded Nurettin Pasha.
After that, Ali ihsan Pasha's relationship with Atatürk never improved.
The problem of seniority in the Turkish army is not only in war but also in peace.
Of course it has to come out.
Veysel kösele is the last example of this.
"Who is the street? he had to find out the answer to his question.
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was deeply shaken.
One day after I came to New York City to visit, St. He sat in the bed of Airbnb, which Louis hired, and started surfing Facebook on his phone.
He came across a high school share.
"The police just killed a 18-year-old boy and he's still lying on the street. he said.
When he realized that no one else was sharing this information in the content stream, he was surprised that he closed facebook and turned on Twitter.
A user named @ TheePharoah was repeatedly tweeted in his content stream.
St. George's The rapper from Louis district was tweeting the death of Michael Brown live, 18-year-old black, unarmed, murdered by a white police officer in Ferguson Missouri.
He shared a photograph of Brown's lifeless body on the street, who would stay there for four hours.
"This is brutal."he thought.
But death was nothing new to him or his community.
He left his phone to return to the tweets about people gathering at Canfield drive later that evening.
"Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"there were photographs of a man holding a banner saying"
A live broadcast was watched by a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a dog barking.
In another video, another COP, he said, set the trigger of his rifle and shouted, "I'm going to kill you all... animals."
"This is unusual.he remembered what he said.
"'This is not the kind of murder we are accustomed to and what we call typical.'
I felt chill at the moment.
I was angry and crying."
He booked a return ticket and went home the next day.
After leaving at 11: 00 p.m., he took his 6-year-old daughter from his father's house and decided to go with her to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years will come to the cinemas on August 11th, "who are the streets?"on the subject of a new documentary called.
This is a story about survival and protest, love and loss, power and resistance from the perspective of people living in that society and filling the streets with the answers they seek.
Ferrell returned to Ferguson with his daughter, who wore a flowered dress and wore a suitable crown, to talk about the "experiences of blacks and the status of blacks" they had done many times that morning.
"Do you remember I taught you that black people should fight for their faith?"he remembered what he said.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not true.
I couldn't have taken her away."Ferrell said later.
"What happened here today... it's the result of what happened in the past.
He must know it, see it, and catch up in it.
It should not only flourish in the field of Activism and organizing but also know the layers of the Black experience and the Black state and what we must do to liberate ourselves.
If I were lucky enough to give her an experience that she wouldn't personally experience rude racism, she would be no different from any black woman-child.
I feel like I'm doing him some harm while protecting him from these things."
When they arrived at Ferguson, their first stop was on South Florissant road across from the police station, which turned into a Campground for activists, waiting to talk to Officer Darren Wilson about a later offence.
There, Ferrell and his daughter contacted local business owners who prepared packaged food.
They Packed bags and helped bring them to the protesters.
A new kind of Activism was being shaped for Ferrell.
When I was a student at the Missouri State University, minority students became President of the nurses ' Union and in the Black society focused on food Justice and injustice, "my activist turned out to be completely after 9 August." quoth.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It came out on its own."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Falan, co-director of the film at an evening show.
Falan said he and his cinematographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" What was going on.
"Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can use?"
This skepticism has been reported by numerous people, usually whites, to come to a society and benefit from its pain and resistance...
"We heard people born and raised in Ferguson, and we decided to do it differently," folayan explained in an interview recently."
Falan had already contacted Co-Director Damon Davis, a regional artist known for his activist involvement in the death penalty inmates.
His involvement heated Ferrell to the project, among other six regional natives, "whose streets are?"the team watched this in the years after Brown was shot.
David said, "this documentary is not someone talking to us or talking to us; It's US talking."
"That's what was essential for me, how to represent these people because it's how to represent me."
"While the goal is not to focus on ferrrell's experiences, it shows that the movement is "not about a Messiah leader, but about society to come together," he said, proving that film participants are the most vulnerable.
As a result, "whose are the streets?"surprisingly, he documents the personal aspects of Ferrari's life, like falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt like I was naked." quoth.
"But when I was doing this and humanizing black people, I realized there might be some sensitivity."
In addition, Ferrell's story consolidates and reassembles the role of Black gay women in the Black lives matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who derived the #BlackLivesMatter slogan in social media after the murder of Black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, describe themselves as homosexuals.
"Black gay women in leadership have generally kept the movement up, "said Ferrell," and this is because we are constantly fighting on many fronts.
Black gay women have to bear all their weight."
"The movement is really being held up by black women and many gay black women."
However, Ferrell insists that "this is not chosen because of their identity" and that there is nothing in the kind of action that affirms it.
He says: "he was the one who triggered this energy."
"But it's not a coincidence that he's on the front lines, because as a black gay woman, you lose a lot of life at this intersection.
You can feel her energy from the screen."
In the meantime, Ferguson's news cameras are already gone, but there are disturbing racial connections between society and police.
Ferrell's been under surveillance for two and a half years because of shutting down the highway during a show.
My house defines the socio-political atmosphere in the region as "chaos" in one word.
Still, he holds the song that he dug into his memory three years ago when he went out on Ferguson's streets.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our job to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
Yorgo Vulgarakis: I think it is obvious that we have dealt with matters effectively.

An appropriate analogy: the artist uses Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits
In the middle of the room at the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces of white, black and brown hanging over the cables on the ceiling, each of which is almost indistinguishable.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Haggborg, by the ear rods and cut hair sent to him by Chelsea Manning.
As is known, former Intelligence Analyst manning, who has been sentenced to 35 years after leaking confidential diplomatic messages through WikiLeaks, sent his cut hair from Fort Leavenworth prison.
The name of the new exhibition opened on August 2 is a proper similarity.
This is the product of two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, a trans-woman and a leading dissident, Manning, who has been pardoned by Barack Obama for three days, who combined his discipline with his expertise in technology, computer science and art.
The DNA extracted from Manning was algorithmically analyzed and created 30 portraits of what a person with this gene data would look like, Dewey-Hagborg revealed not only the workability of DNA data (determinism from the essence of the interpretation) but also the identity of itself with a strong, perhaps somewhat cerebral interpretation.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but clearly described himself as a woman in adolescence, was convicted of 20 crimes in 2013, six of which were from the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.
His image was put under pressure by prison, so that there was only one photograph: a sandy, black-and-white özçekim, where Manning, apparently distressed, sits in the driver's seat, wearing a Platinum-yellow wig that he longed for.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg succeeded in the project in 2012 with the more bizarre hunch of the hunch.
In order to take a picture of what these people would look like, the artist produced portraits by filtering out DNA from the rashes of forensic pieces such as cigarette butts and gum.
That's when he got an e-mail from paper magazine.
"They had an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and asked for some kind of portrait that could accompany this writing."Dewey-Hagborg explained, in the press preview of the new exhibition.
They couldn't be visited, and they couldn't be photographed, so they reached Chelsea and asked him if he was interested in making a DNA portrait.
The artist and his imprisoned inspiration became unexpected letter mates by exchanging letters over a period of two years.
They even unearthed suppressed images, a cartoon book by Shili kango, where the President forgives the punishment of Chelseaâ and sees the exhibition as a personal vision of a future.
Obama really wanted Manning to evacuate a few days after the release of the book was a kind of happy coincidence that came after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas.
While Donald Trump finds new, tweet ways to further blunt the sharp divisions he is asked to repair, there is something deep and powerful about this exhibition that is currently opened.
When asked about the strange timing of all this, Dewey-Haggborg said, "events happen for some reason." quoth.
An artist statement written on the wall of the gallery, which Manning's huge signature, was under it (whose last name is "I" with the heart), calling for an end to "automatic discrimination based on gender, race, sexuality and culture".
He has a mitochondrial DNA sequence across the wall: many C's, G's, and a's written in pencil...
Dewey Haggborg, who included 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's sophisticated scientific dictionary), wanted to tell us how astonishingly we are all alike, at least as biological beings.
"What I hope people will get out of this is that they don't care about who our genome is and how open the genetic data is to interpretation, how subjective it is."said Dewey-Haggborg, who was on display in the memories of his video work imitated in 2007.
"DNA data can tell many different stories, and this is 30 of them."
The last piece of the exhibition held in a single room is a page from the short comic book mentioned earlier.
Here, Manning is shown with a speaker from the King Kong style, the Disciplinary barracks of the United States.
"When they silenced your speech, they win."it says.
"So never shut up."
Artist from Philadelphia, "This came directly from a letter he wrote to me." quoth.
"You still get goose bumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not personally seen the exhibition (as it has been projected from the comic book) yet, but when he sees it, he will be greeted by masks of his own genetic rhinoceroses, gathered in the middle of the room like a group of protestors.
Like everything else in the exhibition, the genetic haplotypes were made from Manning to manning's longitudinal (5"2, Manning's longitudinal), which was written with lead pencils.
Dewey-Hagborg, about portraits, said, "I used to put them on the wall in the past, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd." quoth.
"I wanted it to be perceived as a collective movement shaped by Chelsea, which is the movement behind His liberation ."

Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "we will complete the WADA Road Map in the short term"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (rusada) will not take a long time to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria in order to reactivate.
"A specific stage has been completed in fulfilling road map criteria, and Russia has the right to plan and test in cooperation with the United Kingdom Anti-Doping.
WADA road map has been updated in this context."he said on Thursday, Mutko.
The prime minister was evaluating the second part of the WADA Regulation alignment Roadmap, which describes the criteria for the re-functioning of Russia, which was recently published on the institution's website.
According to Mutko, this does not include anything to worry Russia.
"Everything is announced, all will be applied.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future., "he added.
However, a criterion mentioned on the list states that Russian anti-doping officials have to publicly accept the reported results of the state-run doping investigation, allegedly in Russian sports by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, approved by WADA.
Mutko referred to the issue as follows: "while our anti-doping system accepts a failure, we carry out the investigation.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no government program, and we will not accept anything that did not exist."
Mutko's remarks reiterated Vitaly Smirnov, President of the Russian independent public Anti-Doping Commission.
Speaking to Russian broadcaster Rsport earlier in the day, Smirnov acknowledged past problems in Russian anti-doping bodies, but added: "We have said that the report contains Anti-Doping positions and regulations.
No one wants to accept the report unconditionally."he added, Smirnov.

Start-ups to help your company not be the next uber
Amy errett wanted to measure her employee's happiness in e-commerce start-up, but the Polls didn't work.
The answers were usually vague, non-helpful, or even worse deceptive.
Even if he committed anonymity, some employees didn't trust the process.
"There has never been any consistency or objectivity," says Errett, a 75-person e-commerce Company, Madison Reed, on Hair Care in San Francisco.
He called outside for help.
A new kind of human resources start-up is emerging to enable companies to understand how their employees feel.
These allow employees to create and license a software whose specific purpose is to measure employees ' activity, to conduct surveys of firms with questionable options, to target specific teams and demographic groups, to offer anonymous and complaint support to employees, and, in some cases, to allow employees to bypass their top executives and to Go directly to the Board of Directors to announce a
Software analysis tools measuring employee engagement by companies, Jim Barnett, founder and President of Redwood City start-up, glint, said: "Now there are tools that monitor your health, such as Strava and fitbit, but where is fitbit for your company?, "he said.
Errett says his employees understand what he thought and felt after three years using glint.
In addition to providing specific teams with snapshots and optional surveys, the company offers a heat map with an overview of which departments receive the most complaints and which director has low rated scores, so that the reasons for them can be tampered with.
In order not to be the next uber, companies are beginning to understand that they need to be familiar with the culture of their workplaces; uber has been in a scandal since he described a harassment environment in which a blog article published by an ex-employee was clearly punished for what he was thinking.
For start-ups like glint, this surveillance is a very profitable business opportunity.
According to the financial technology insights website let's talk Payments, the global governance, regulatory and compliance industry could be worth $ 118.7 billion by 2020.
Interest and activity in Denver Colorado-based start-up convergent, which helps companies detect and block bad behavior, has increased early this year amid Uber's controversy over disrepute.
Convergent has close to 600 customers, including Airbn, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a customer.
Like glint, convergent allows companies to perform personalized "pulse" surveys, collect real-time confidential responses, and generate heat maps of problematic areas.
It also offers a helpline that can be sent to an anonymous message where employees can report abuse.
If the President is accused, the complaints Go directly to the Board of Directors.
Patrick quinlan, founder and President of covert, said, "the public court has taken over the regulators."
Quinlan said: If a company is not treating its employees badly or ethically, it may face costly consequences because of consumer boycotts, employee weakness, or lawsuits, even if regulators don't come into play.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations, has been using Convercent for over a year to keep its employees informed of the principles and procedures and to provide easy access to the company.
When a former employee wanted to report a problem, he had to find a telephone number or e-mail belonging to the company headquarters, filed an official complaint, and hoped it would be taken seriously.
James Vitrano, the chief Legal Counsel of Ruby Tuesday, said These are mostly intimidating experiences and not a good way to follow up on employee complaints.
But now that the Company uses convergent, problems that have been concealed from managers who previously lived in Office, city, or state locations (such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair salary practice) can be identified and resolved more quickly.
Vitrano, Managing Ruby Tuesday's Risk Management Group, said: "I can approach this employment experience from a holistic 360 degree perspective."
"Furthermore, we protect our shareholders against business lawsuits."
In 2002, after the bankruptcy of accounting firm Arthur Andersen due to the breach of ethical values stemming from the Enron scandal, the companies discussed ethics, values and relationships with the employee more seriously in 2002, quinlan said.
But after "social media came to its senses," companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty Laundry from becoming viral.
"Before technology was used to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy." quoth.
They offer both glint and convergent software as a service and receive repeated fees for the use of their products.
This is a business model and opportunity with the approval of risk capital investors who support both start-ups.
Convercent received $ 10 million in financing from Sapphire Ventures and Tola capital in February and raised its total capital to $47 million.
Glint made $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and raised its total financing to $ 60 million.
These investments are not surprising considering the nature, culture and risk capital of companies that are linked to each other.
Increased research shows that today's employees expect more from their workplaces than before.
High salaries and interesting projects in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are only minimum requirements.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted, valued, and given their time to a company with a positive mission.
Nina McQueen, Vice President of global benefits and employee experience of LinkedIn, both convergent and glint, said: "if people are happy to be in a company, feel heard, and feel satisfied with their work, they are more deeply committed to making that company successful."
Investors gain when their portfolio companies do good; companies do good if their employees feel sincere and belonging to the company.
If third party analysis tools promise to increase employee intimacy and feeling of belonging, it's no wonder they find support.
It is important to have data on employee Loyalty according to workplace culture experts.
But the data is useless if the company's responsible don't take action.
In fact, if a company wants feedback from its employees, it can create an expectation that the change is coming.
And if anticipation doesn't come fast enough or never comes at all, it can be disappointing and make your employees feel like they're broken.
Potter is president of business management international consulting firm and companies who made the mistake in gathering their data too much to trust Russell Raath "If you will want suggestion to 4000, 4000 to talk you need to be ready." quoth.
'Cause if you don't follow, your employees will think,' did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And why do I care if you don't care?'"
According to errett, Madison Reed, who conducted monthly employee surveys, was able to take action the same day when a glint reported a problem.
And after collecting feedback from employees who are tired of the decision-making mechanism and the speed of communication quality, he was able to reorganize various teams within the company and added communication training to solve problems.
In Ruby Tuesday, the company receives new insights into its employees, and hopes that in the long run it will turn into more workers in this industry, which is known to be a high number of workers in the long run.
Vitrona said: "If you are not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you will lose people."
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you lose firms."

It comes at 11: 00 a.m. and a team of UCLA football players hang out to chat on one side of the new training field on campus.

For a major part of the team, these spare minutes are the middle of the day.
After 3 hours of training, the players registered in summer classes will return to their homeland and will be working for the final exams before returning to Wasserman football Centre for the next 6.30 pm.

In September, they plan to perform 18 trainings until 20 August before they start official match preparations for their opening against Texas A&M.
Mora said that even though the players have added new items to the intensive study program, the NCAA supports the change in the rules.

If there's video recording of a training session, that's a pretty good thing.

Creating comic books: the story of a castle in England
In his recent past, the tiny Scotney Castle, took part in a Squeeze music clip and became a refuge for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But right now, Scotney has witnessed a 700-year-old turbulent history from his comfortable seat in the Bewley River Valley in Kent, inspiring a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire-haired, historical writer.
"I find it very nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years."he says in a light way.
"What a personal bond to hold this letter in my hand."
A fort in England from the time of Edward to the Middle Ages, each story documents the families living in Scotland to be depicted by a different artist (Isaac Lankiewicz, Briony may Smith, William exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg) from the United Kingdom.
This is not Rhodes ' first book based on an archival: he also wrote the teeth and other stories of dead men in 2014, a project inspired by stories in the British Library, which he finds unexpectedly emotional.
"I could see the fingerprints on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for King James supporters."he says.
"It was his thumbprint!
The letters always smell like work, because then you lit a fire for the light.
For someone in 300 years, it feels like he's there.
Oh, I love archives!"
As a lover of old papers, I have overcome a little more than I have to be warmly welcomed to seek support from the National Trust and the British Council of Art and to stay in a castle for almost four months (to be honest).") looks too good.
Rhodes spent the days exploring the Victorian "New" Castle, scanning archives, and working with many treasures and antiques, such as hyena heads and bottles that had spent centuries in ditches mounted on the walls of the mansion.
He traveled through the lands and ruins of the old castle, talking to the guards, Gardeners and artists sometimes working on the illustrations of his book.
Then at night, he'd drink whiskey and write.
The detailed history of Scotney is relatively unknown because National Trust is only accessible when the last heir Elizabeth Hussein died in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff began to take over the archive, describing it as follows: "for centuries, the aristocrats said: 'Oh, throw him in the attic.'"
Journals, letters from the days of the British Empire, maps that determine who has what limits: "you think the territorial disputes will be boring."Rhodes says," but there was a birch tree where the two families fought on it.
Fuck it, guys!"
Some of the stories in the collection, including the labourer, who abandoned the newly built castle to join the peasant revolt in 1381, use the castle as a stepping stone for a wider introduction to English history.
"In this book, the Knights families of Kent and Sussex, there is a record that there was a riot in the castle in 1380."Rhodes says.
"The peasant revolt started around here and I thought that a riot could be a good starting point.
Maybe these two could be connected?"
Other stories are closely related to the castle's history, for example, the priest of a Jesuit, the priest of the Darrell family, who kept a Jesuit pastor for seven years during his English practice.
Or a coffin filled with stones and thought to have his own funeral 18. the Smuggler (a revelation made years later when the coffin was removed from the soil), including the 19th-century smuggler Arthut Darrell.
"These gentlemen seemed quite rogues, always getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrell men resolved their debt crisis by marrying rich old women; I imagine them as a group of handsome men who had the ability to woo female heirs."
Rhodes, who has completed his mission in the castle, is in search of other singular writing experiences.

Writers commented on the match of Fenerbahce-Sturm Graz
For two seasons I could not find, I could not see the joy and glory again had met Kadıköy...
Aykut kocaman's "mangal-hearted" team was on the field to make a "stand behind us" deal with his fans.
We can bring criticism to your game, positions or performances, but I haven't seen a game that works like this in a long time.
The first match was obvious, but yesterday he put his own apoları omzuna; Fenerbahce's commander on the field is now Valbuena.
His age was a problem when he was transferred, but Kocaman's words had the phrase "not giving up".
30 years ago, we gave consent Çalimbay the right to name the atomic ant.
If he deals with it, it will be the most appropriate interpretation for the French player.
He was all over the field, participating in all pas events, always taking responsibility and throwing a goal, making a huge show of short length.
Alper's leading, second striker position Durm Graz left the team "restricted" in the field for a long time.
Fenerbahce circuit to overcome such a harsh wall while closing the winner before throwing korner constantly sought formula.
They control the ball, but they can't produce an effective pass in the field of competition.
This image may bring the interpretation of "need a centrifuge", but we are faced with a game that hesitates to pass Ahmethan, which does not put the only centrifuge in position.
Either the team did not trust the young player or the performance needs to improve a little more.
After the score was 1-1, they could not take advantage of two clear opportunities.
It was important for them to pass the tour, but it would make the night even better to stand up as a "goal" supporter who applauded the players ' struggle standing.
There will probably be a couple of new transfers by Monday.
But the truth is that Fenerbahce needs the number 12...
We are on the verge of a very bright and enjoyable season with this style of play that carries the hearts of those who try to play ahead.
Aykut kocaman's machine is installing the floor, needs a little more time.
They're in good physical quality.
The quality of the game will improve.
You can see that all the players on the field have increased their confidence.
They need applause last night for a new page.
The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
Just as you think 2017 can't get any weirder, there comes a new report on technological developments in the sex robot industry.
Yep.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the responsible robot Science Institute (FRR) issued a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
According to Santa Sharkey, a retired Professor and FRR founder of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University, we should take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, nipple shape and nail type.
"People are laughing at them, but the companies are actually a lot of referrals, and we're going to see them even more."
Modern sex dolls evolved into robots with silicone skin that is hot to touch, especially human-like reactions performed by artificial intelligence.
Users can also choose everything from the robot's eye color to the nipple shape and the nail type or color to personalize their robots to fit their own ideas.
But with so many robots having "personalities" to make a Stepford woman look innovative, this is even more disturbing.
Modern Sex dolls evolved into silicone-skined robots.
For example, the Realbootix robot allows its users to personalize their robots according to the character traits they find attractive (for example, inhibitions).
Then there are roxxxy gold sex robots developed by true companion, including"Frijit Farrah" and "wild Wendy", who have come with pre-programmed personalities, who have the impression of being intimidated.
True Companion's web site enthuses: "Roxxxy Gold, has a personality that fits you, your personality as much as possible."
I mean, you love what you love, you don't love what you don't love, and so on.
There are also mood swings like real people in the day.
He can be sleepy, he can be willing to talk, or he can be in full mode.
There are many disturbing aspects of the rise of sex robots: not only the replacement of true human relations, but the personality traits of a highly obedient woman, the rapist connotations of approaching Frijit Farah are the most suggestive ones.
On the Web site, true Companion likens Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If a woman can be a vibrator, why not a Roxxx of men?"the website says.
But these sex robots aren't just fetish or sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity point to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat towards sexual desire through subjugation, an optional attachment to the ideal of gender equality.
Many men will not naturally have sex robots, and although FRR draws attention to their growing popularity, they are currently in the outer periphery of consumer culture.
But those who are leaking from the end can be highly instructive about the course of the period we live in.
Many people are not strange or aggressive until the free market gives them the right to be.
It is not a coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots are appearing at a time when women's rights are threatened around the world with the presence of a president in the White House boasting sexual assault on women.
The most creepy aspect of the handmaid's Tale TV series is not the depictions of all the details, the necked bodies or the carved eyes, but how realistic the image feels.
The Republic of Gilead is a sudden change, but it doesn't feel like it's a big change right now.
The purpose behind these sex robots is to create as much physical likeness as possible to real women as technologically possible (of course, at the rates of Porn film stars).
Their creators want them to feel human when they touch and mimic the movements of a real body.
But when it comes to their "personalities", robots can't clearly represent real women.
They can't leave their wives or leave them.
They have no activity or past stories, nothing to expose their independence or disrupt the fantasy of total slavery.
In other words, they are slaves that give pleasure.
Or, in the words of 2017, the concubines.
Attack on the American military convoy: there are dead and wounded...

The explosion killed 1 NATO soldier and 3 civilians, including the wounded, 5 of the wounded in the convoy and 1 of the U.S. soldiers working with the NATO forces, the interpreter said.
In an official statement by the NATO support force in Afghanistan, NATO forces have detonated a suicide bomber during a joint patrol mission with the Afghan National Army.
Wounded personnel are being treated at Bagram Airport American military hospital.
The wounded are in no danger of life.
The local media reports that the suicide bomber is a member of the Taliban.
Trump's great skill?
To make Mitt Romney look like a common sense crocodile
The micro-scale Division of the political division that polarized the US electorate was the reality of the Trump era.
Around Christmas and thanksgiving, newspapers in the United States were filled with how to deal with the nightmare of relatives who voted for Trump.
We're all trying to blow up our filtering bubbles.
The less talked about is Trump's power to bring families together.
I'm referring to this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago, who's broken between the Republicans in our family, visits us this week in New York.
He reminded me that joining against a common enemy could have a strong effect.
Everyone he knows, including his Republican brother, who has been debating about politics for decades, is on the same side, suddenly and strangely, with Trump appearing in the White House.
This is of course a good thing at the dinner table, but it seems to me that it carries significant risks in a wide context.
The left was revived by Trump, but the bending effect of his presidency has always created the power to push to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we're talking about the terrible possibility that one day his strange behavior can no longer be shocking.
In fact, there is a much more terrible long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the right-wing Republicans who oppose their own standards, and these seem to be symbols of logic.
I find myself experiencing nostalgia about the bizarre version of Mitt Romney's madness: the dog on the roof of the car, 14% income tax (at least we knew at least what his tax refund looked like), which is both very light offences, according to Trump.
When Trump is gone, the next Republican candidate has to be just sane to assess that he has achieved immeasurable progress.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the merry-go-round in Central Park, the biggest of the charms run by the New York parks Department, and the best three bucks you can spend in town if you don't need a cup of coffee.
The horses are huge, the Fiberglass designs in the central cylinder (the clown and the animals all making strange faces turned to look fearfully behind their shoulders), and the jingling music is incredibly exhilarating.
In other words, many stereotypes of a city can be disappointing: the sights of higher buildings are getting boring, the horizon is getting too familiar to create more excitement, and the reality of the city is not falling.
It's been thirty-five years and I still haven't been able to overcome the day that I discovered that Swiss Cottage is not actually a Swiss country house (the themed bar doesn't count as the Old Swiss Cottage), but a huge turnaround in North London.
But it's still a strange magic experience when it comes to the merry-go-round in central park, so that two-year-olds, an 11-year-old person, and two women in their 40s can go here and have a great time.
If I could give a note to the merry-go-round, I would give her a full note, but thank goodness nobody asked.
On the other hand, I was asked to evaluate my transaction "experience" between 1 and 5 stars before I spent my credit card on a Chartered account this week.
The same thing at the coffee shop on the corner of my Street is the option to match a note with a 15% tip; for what was bought from the counter...
The effect of this is not only that it slows down what needs to be a neutral exchange, but also that it puts pressure on the server to bring personality to an event that is not needed at all.
I gave him five stars of my credit card experience.
When the temperature went beyond 41 degrees, they wore swimsuits.
In Tunceli, where one of the hottest days of the season, the public flocked to the beaches of Munzur.

Especially in Germany, Holland, France and England, living in countries such as Tunceli, Aegean or Mediterranean rather than spend their holidays in their country because of the beaches on the edge of the"Munzur Stream" overflowing.
Suna tosun, which is among the coolers in Munzur beach, prefers to use Tunceli instead of western provinces for the holiday, "I did not want to spend my holiday in the west, the family in munzur'da cooler, stay on their own territory was more accurate."
"Munzur's icy water is nowhere in the world," Munzur said.
Hasan Ulu from Germany, instead of çeşme or Bodrum beaches, they prefer the coast of Munzur tea in Tunceli and therefore they are not regretted.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital with chest pains
This is the second time that Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit.

Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can relieve ibh
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare to your digestive system.
But a new study claims the opposite: a rich diet of meat-based protein and dairy products can help alleviate the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
This untreatable health condition, which affects 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 people in the United Kingdom, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Although patients are often advised to skip meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that the main amino acid tryptophan helps develop immune cells that develop a resilient bowel.
Chief of staff, prof. Marco Colonna said that the immune cells are patrolling the intestines so that the germs that are stored in the food do not enter the body.
The cells that are able to trigger inflammation are balanced with cells that promote resilience by protecting delicate tissues without damaging them.
If the balance shifts too much towards inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can result.
Experiments found that mice carrying a specific bacterium in their intestines had a type of immune cell that encourages resistance.
And the bacterium needs tryptophane, one of the building blocks of the protein, to trigger the cells to appear.
Professor Colonna: "we have established a connection between Lactobacillus reuteri and the development of the cell population that promotes endurance, which is part of the intestinal Microbiology.' quoth.
Mice with more tryptophan in their diet had more of these immune cells.'
If the same thing happens in humans, L. he suggested that a diet rich in reuteri and tryptophan could improve a more resistant, less inflammatory bowel environment.
Postdoctoral Researcher Dr. While Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas working on a type of immune cell that improves endurance, she discovered that a group of rats had these cells, but that another group of rats who were the same type and kept in a different place did not.
He suspected that the difference was related to the intestinal microorganisms of mice, in other words to the bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the stomach-intestine Canal.
DNA sequencing of the intestines of mice was performed and it was found that mice with immune cells had six types of bacteria, but that they were lacking in mice.
The immune system is a group of organs that fight infection and disease. reuteri was given and the immune cells appeared.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers L. they magnified reuteri in liquid and then transferred small amounts of this non-bacterium into immature immune cells taken from mice.
The immune system
When the active ingredient was purified from liquid, it appeared that tryptophan metabolism, known as indol-3-lactic acid, was a byproduct.
When researchers double the amount of tryptophan in mice ' food, the number of cells increased by around 50 percent, but the number of cells decreased by half when tryptophan levels were halved.
Dr. Cervantes-barragan has cells that promote the same resilience as humans, and most of us are in the stomach-intestine Canal. he said he harbored the Reuter.
L. L. tryptophan side products from Reuters are not known to develop as in humans, but disorders associated with tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
"The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage, because these cells control inflammation on the inside of the intestines.
Potential. where reuteri exists, high-level tryptophan causes the spread of this population."

The White House Show Cost Taxpayers Thousands
According to time's military records, the White House's decision to fly a marine helicopter to the southern grass for an organization that raised American production last month cost taxpayers a figure of $24,000.
When the president arrived, green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as marine one, was the focus of the organization that introduced American construction programs in the White House on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike pence, and Senior White House officials toured products produced in all 50 states.
The helicopter at Connecticut, a boat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
According to Marine Helicopter Squadron one (HMX-1) records, the White House War office requested the presence of the helicopter only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on southern grass for an "unusual" organization.
"I just wanted to make sure you're aware of it, because it's an extraordinary high-visibility organization."wrote an e-mail.
The message indicated that the helicopter would come to the South lawn at around 7: 00 a.m. on July 17 and stay there until the grass was cleared from 6: 00 p.m.
Note, If the White House was delayed departure, a second flight crew would be required for the return flight due to the task time limitations.
The original flight crew was in the helicopter during the event, while the unit security personnel were standing on the ground.
It is unclear whether a second flight crew is ultimately required from the records provided to time.
The hatch law prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records show that hmx-1 is investigating whether the organization violates this Charter.
"A question we asked was whether or not he violated the hatch law, and we were told he did not."he wrote.

The" Made in America " organization is designated by the White House as an official organization and is not covered by the Hatch act.

An official said that the flight for the Made in America organization was considered a training requirement for the air crew within that month.
Unit helicopters flew for an additional 11 hours on that day to "support tasks that had nothing to do with the presidency."
The White House said tax payers did not pay for any other number in the organization.
A spokesman for sikorksky said their firm did not participate in the setting up of the helicopter on the southern lawn.
Hmx-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights and it is difficult to determine the exact expenses incurred by the organization.
But according to the Department of defense's hourly rates for 2017 fiscal year, the Department of Defense's VH-3D welcome rate is $24,340 per flight time.
The unit records the flight time of the aircraft from its central base in Marine Corps Air facility Quantico, Virginia, to both sides in 30 minutes.
The White House claims that the actual operating expense of the helicopter is far below that.
Walters said, "it is very misleading for tax payers to make an expense based on cost compensation rate estimates." quoth.

And I think we're all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment that many Americans, like most Americans, are working tirelessly to do.
So of course it is appropriate to put it forward."
It is not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter while cruising the southern grass for the organization, but he stepped into the driver's seat of a fire truck.
Trump, inside the White House, sang to Sikorsky representatives by joking about the media and the company's products on its own fleet.
