Last minute: Our cosmic visitor Dev asteroid 2014 JO25
There are billions of maybe more massive skies in the Sun System that circulate head-to-head and can lead to serious consequences when it hits.
The path of these spiders, which can have closed or open orbits left by the Sun "formation, can sometimes pass through Earth.
The 650-foot-tall asteroid 2014 JO25 is also such a visitor and will go through and from 1.75 million km away, the closest position to Earth today at 14: 24.
Tonight, we've become more often heard of this kind of news.
The main reason is developments in surveillance techniques and observation appliances.
This means we also have the opportunity to determine the smaller sized asteroids that have not previously been determined.
Last January, for example, a bus size asteroid was just half of Earth and Family distance (about 250,000 km) away and gone.
And even more interesting was able to be determined just days before the asteroid passed.
So there may be other cosmic buses coming over us right now.
Imagine, if you get the news that a 20-foot-wide asteroid would fall into the middle of the neighborhood where you are, what would you do?
In fact, asteroids of this size do not destroy your neighborhood, but probably the windows of all buildings will explode.
This will be due to the shockwaves spreading from the asteroid that will land in the atmosphere.
In 2013, for example, the asteroid that crashed into Russia was in these dimensions, and enough to smash the windows of buildings in a few cities.
However, if you have a neighborhood at the target of a 100ft-wide asteroid, the advice to you is to go at least 50km away from the neighborhood.
Criteria such as the size of the asteroid and the point of collision are factors that determine the depth of the chatter and the damage to the collision.
Let's take a look at a few scenarios, according to the simulation of the European Space Agency.
If a 100-foot-wide asteroid drops to Earth at a speed of 60km per second with a 45-degree deficit, it creates a crater with a depth of about 250 feet and a 1200-mile pound.
The collision is equivalent to an earthquake measuring 6 on the Richter scale, and even if you are 10km from the point of collision, there is a 3rd degree burn in your body.
Those 50km away will be waiting for the shattered window windows.
If an asteroid stretches across 1km, the situation becomes even more intimate.
With the same hunger and speed value, if such an asteroid hits Earth, it is about 600 metres deep and a 12km wide crater is formed.
So a comedy district would turn into a king and disappear instantly.
There is a 3rd degree burn in your body, even if you are 100km away from the point of collision due to the collision.
The collision is equivalent to an earthquake measuring 8 on the Richter scale.
The damage to the asteroid depends not only on the chemical composition of the asteroid, but also on the area's rocky structure, where it will hit.
The above values were given in reference to the scenario that occurs if a hard-rock like asteroid falls into an area made up of grassy rocks.
If the asteroid is mostly made up of rails, the crater size will increase by three times if it falls into a place with a surface formed by the onset of the lava, and the catastrophe that occurs depending on it.
66 million years ago, something more decent came to the head of the dinosaurs, and they were subjected to catastrophic flooding when an asteroid crashed about 10km across.
As a result of the asteroid collision, 75 per cent of sea and land turtles have instantly vanished.
If an extremely large asteroid that destroyed the dinosaurs has targeted Earth, sure, the most robust option would be to leave the planet.
Tonnes of substances fall every day from space into the world.
Most of them burn and ash in the atmosphere.
Some skyscrapers, which are large enough, burn in the atmosphere, causing particles, popularly known as star slides.
Let's end our summer with another news to inner relief.
The work shows that an extremely massive asteroid that will cause very serious devastation for the next 300 to 400 years is not expected to hit Earth.
As trainers who live an average of 70 years, I'm sure your drink has been a bit of a relief.

Flavor claim for Medel: 10m euros!
Gary Medel, who is sure to leave Inter on the Sixers' agenda looking to reinforce the stoppage zone....
The 30-year-old, who is on holiday after playing in the Confederations Cup with Chile and recently resumed work with Inter, is waiting for future offers for him.
Gazzetta dello Sport, a prestigious newspaper for the Italians, suggested that Besiktas, for Medel, who could be involved in both the starter, and the front row area, had made a £10m bid for Inter.
The Sydneysider, who submitted his offer to Medel, said he was expecting answers from both sides, but the Chilean footballer was said to be keen to live with his family in Istanbul.
Gazzetta's claim but Black Cards, the FFP limitation, is unlikely to pay as much as £10m for Medel.

Human rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Renewable People has issued a warning for people of color who will travel to Missouri, due to the province's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The Grupun statement reads: "The state of Missouri, NAACP Travel Transportation Declaration, valid from August 28, 2017, is there, as African-American travelers, visitors and Missouri residents have recently specified their susceptible, race-based travelers from the very beginning.
The NAACP said a new Missouri law makes it harder for people to win discrimination cases, but also because the province's legal practices disproportionately target minorities, is a factor in the group releasing this travel warning.
"There are human rights violations that happen to people," he said.
They are stopped, beaten and killed because of the color of their magazine, "said Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri NAACP to the Kansan City Star.
"We hear complaints at the rate we haven't heard before," he said.
It is the first time the association has issued such a warning for a county in the United States.
The group cited incidents of racial insults against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Earlier this year, Sanders was detained by Missouri police before being charged with a crime and died under suspicious circumstances following the end of his fuel as he walked through the province.
The recommendation statement also points to a new report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office, which shows that black drivers in the province are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than whites.
"The warning statement is for people to be awake and to warn their families, friends and colleagues that they can be in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People should be ready, whether it's to bring bail money in their acquaintances, to report to their relatives that they are going to go through this province," he said.
In Missouri, 100 hate crimes were committed in 2015, according to the most recent figures in the FBI's hate crime reporting program; it puts the province 16th in the country in terms of the number of similar violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that makes it more difficult to sue for a workplace to discriminate when renting a house or doing business.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel advice for Texas and Arizona after those counties passed immigration freedom laws ordering local executive authorities to arrest people for immigration violations; the ACLU says it would increase enforcement based on race.
Travel warnings are often issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately recruitment groups have resorted to the practice in response to a number of laws and trends within the United States.
Demba Ba tail in Besiktas
Demba Ba, who moved to Chinese team Shanghai Shenhua for £13m two seasons ago and was rushed to the Black Cats for a touchdown last season, returns to the Brewers "at no cost.
The Black Cards, seeking a detailed health report from the Senegalese player last week, follows a report from the star.
The Sydney-based management began work for the 32-year-old, who the Chinese representative is not considering in the squad next season, knocking on the door of the Shanghai team.
Not written on the list
Demba Ba, who was not written on the list because he had foreign status in China, referred to the administration that he wanted to go back to black - the Bears.
The Chinese team approved the 32-year-old's departure.
The Senegalese player is expected to arrive in Turkey in the coming days to sign a formal contract.
Castillo underwent surgery in the trailer
Castillo underwent an arthroscopic meningitis operation from the left series at Istanbul Liv Hospital, the boyhood club said in a statement on its website, adding: "After the operation carried out by Professor Ugur Rights, our player is envisaged to start training with the team in four weeks."

The Colombian, who was announced to be out of the field for three to four weeks because of his treatment, was also ordered to undergo surgery because of a meningitis problem he had previously suffered.
A referendum exit from Barzan!
Barzani delivers a speech at a memorial service in Duhok to mark the 3rd anniversary of the terrorist group IS attacking the Ezids in Sincar, Mosul.
"I need to say this sadly, we have no hope that Iraq will be a proper and decent country," Barzani said in his speech, referring to the independence referendum IKBY wants to hold on September 25th.
We have tried all the ways with Iraq but remained completely helpless and desperate.
The past experience we have with Iraq has brought us to this and there is no guarantee that we can take our rights and be protected.
So to ensure life and security together, we all have to show that we can dedicate our destiny to the whole world through a referendum.
I have to underline that; the referendum is not a goal for us, but it is a tool for us to achieve the bigger goal.
After the Baas Regiment was demolished in 2003, the Iraqi central government made a number of promises to the Kurds, Barzani recalled, adding soon that the disaster in Sincar had occurred, adding that a direct referendum decision had been made after the fight against IS.
Barzani said he wants to dedicate peacefully and democratically to the protection and development of the people of IKBY. "It has come up with documents that Iraq, like a state, is unable or unwilling to protect us."
"He doesn't want us to move forward," he argued.
The Iraqi central government did not give them a weapon during the fight against IS, a terrorist group, but within a short period of time Hashdi Shaabi, founded with a fetus, was immediately legalised and all weapons cleared, Barzani said.
Inside Iraq's defense system, the Philippines was not amused.
The central government did not make it to the Philippines that it submitted to Hashdi Shaabi.
The Philippines is considered part of Iraq's defense system, according to the constitution.
However, with Hashdi Shaabi having no presence in the constitution, all possibilities were mobilised when the laws were violated.
We are not saying we are against Hashdi Shaabi.
The Philippines and Hashdi Shaabi fought on the same front, but why, on the one hand, Hashdi Shaabi is legalized, the presence of the Philippines and the fight against terrorism are covered.
And these are our deep wounds with Baghdad.
The terrorist group IS launched an attack on Eziders in Sincar, Mosul, on August 3, 2014, killing a number of people, including women and children.

Is nothing sacred?
Trump's White House is now targeting the Freedom Caucus
The most definitive sign of regime change is that they start attacking sculptures.
Americans can see as much destiny as any of this; well, the fact that the self-styled Saddam Hussein was toppled in Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003....
Stephen Miller, one of the key founders of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he symbolically destroyed the Freedom Caucus, in a heated discussion with CNN's Jim Acosta about the president's proposals to sharply restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
Had he done so, he had a slew of boat tours and the Freedom taxpayer would have lynched him.
But he attacked his mantra, and especially his mantra, which was attributed to him after he was added to the memorial base by Emma Lazarus's famous poem 17 years after the memorial itself was completed in 1903.
As Miller walked out to Acosta: "I don't want to talk about history here from scratch, but the Freedom Caucus... is a symbol of American freedom to light the world.
The poetry you're talking about has been added later and is not part of the original Freedom Caucus. "
Miller is actually right, but, as he says, this isn't really about history.
This is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's scary words, it just seems as if a state in them is inviting not only some older immigrants but also the poor's fault: "Gorgeous, poor, / clogged masses are hardwired to take a breath of freedom, / click."
There was never a time when the "perfect unwanted" was so visible on our screens.
Miller was not a literary critic; he was explaining that these people are not welcome in Trump's United States.
The conflict over the mantle of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: This is actually a conflict about America's mantra.
Lazarus and his friends, who had campaigned to put his words at the base of the statue after his death, knew very well that they were engaged in quite a political act.
The sculpture was intent on celebrating the connections between French and American republicanism by printing and representing them with a memoir, Freedom's arrival in the wild in the form of women.
Lazarus changed that mantra: The female fraternity in his poem was no longer abstract, he had a voice.
And it gives him a very varied ad: The Mother of the exiled.
Poetry's marriage to appearance is a dazzling feminist coup and a devastating attack on American anti-immigrant.
And, as the same Lazarus changed the mantle of the statue, right-wing extremists have long wanted to change it back.
Great palate Rush Limbaugh, a Baptist John style one for Trump's arrival, argued in 2010 that Freedom did not invite anyone to drink, but rather the early handover that kept American fire to the world stuck in the dark was a neocon: "Women's Freedom is coming forward.
He has to carry the torch of freedom from the United States of America to the rest of the world.
Not that the torch lit up the road to the United States of America. "
Quite unusually, Limbaugh had actually discovered something.
The mantra of the statue was entirely about the perception point of view.
Lazarus's amazing creative act was to see it as being seen after long and mostly bereft rides by exhausted, reckless but promising people on the decks of ships.
This was really about seeing the world from the perspective of people who are looking for a place to seek refuge and want to improve their lives.
His statue was reacting to them, with words of hope and the warm welcome they needed to hear.
Of course, this is not a perspective that Miller and Trump would justify in any way.
Their torment is not to show the way, but to diminish the hatred that is their only source of power.
The collection also includes one sugary sculpture from Erecteion (six in the original structure), four leaflets from the Athena Nike Temple flick, as well as architectural pieces of the Athena Nike temple with Partenon, Propylaia, Ereteion.

World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of Great Britain team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time only two Scots were able to get into the Great Britain squad
United Kingdom Athletics performance director Neil Blatter says the 16-strong Scottish group in the World Championship squad will make a "huge contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017, which began on Friday.
Black believes that "something is developing" in Scotland and that United Kingdom athletics should learn from it.
"We're obsessed with it and we're trying to understand that and we're going to deal with it until we get out of it," Blatter said.
"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it's about what they're doing.
Scottish athletics thinks this is about what they did.
UK athletics: He thinks this is about what they did.
So is the man on the street in the corner.
This is absolutely great, regardless of the combination of conditions. "
A number of Scottish athletes are competing for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle has been selected as captain by the staff.
"Eilidh is a bit of a purple volunteer.
The captain's speech was unbelievable, "Blatter says.
"Regardless of whether they are Scottish or where they live or train, a few athletes have come out of that room very proud and really motivated," he said.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh added naturally was amazing. "
The silver medallist from the Commonwealth of Nations, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at his fifth World Championships, says it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the UK team.
Scotland's best total athletes figure at previous world championships was the seven accomplished in 1983 and 2015.
Muir, a middle distance runner who set five British and two European records last year, is the leader.
He will join the 1500m and 5,000m.
Chris O'Hare, who has had a very good season, including England Team tries and victories at the Years Return Games, is another Scottish to watch in the 1500m.
Doyle remembers his first championship, when Lee McConnell was the only other Scottish player on the team.
The team captain says he is "very proud" of the move, with many of his nurses not only going to get into the team but, in some cases, he will compete for a medal and will struggle to qualify for the finals.
"The special part of being a team captain is that it was with the votes that were given by other members of the team, so it was already a huge honor, but knowing that your teammates voted for you and picked you made it extra special for me," he added.
'it's clear, I'm proud of all the Scots who got into the team.
It shows how far we get.
And they are here, as self-proven athletes, as athletes who scramble to get on the podium.
As for the captain's speech?
Yes, I think it went well.
I have benefited from the fact that we are very lucky in this situation, and from that point of view, there is a World Championship that is in our house.
So, in reality, this is just the effect of being able to capitalise on this infield support, and the fact that we have been back at the Olympic Stadium, that we are successful.
I get a second chance to get out there and fight and it's going to be such a wonderful atmosphere there, "he said.
Blocking critics on Facebook: If you can't remove voters' criticism, run for state office
The father of our country had some information about negative media coverage.
Americans greeted George Washington, but it didn't take too long for the newspapers to start heavily criticizing him about everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Of course, he was annoyed by the criticism.
But it did not silence her critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "freedom of speech can be eliminated, and we can be stupid and quietly dragged down the coast."
This brings me to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who has to work harder to be like Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted the conversations of at least 450 people expressing their opinions on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff didn't care about the case on the grounds that it was serious, and the online comments were filled with responses of "who cares?"
A lot of people said, "This is just Facebook."
But this is important.
When someone like Hogan, that's particularly important.
That's a Republican governor who is hugely popular in a province that is overwhelmingly Democratic.
It has the second highest rate of litigation among the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a strained deer fist.
He has shown a mastery in leading his province and in strict commitment to principles.
He was also quite capable of using Facebook as a primary tool to bond with his constituents, as he shrugged off his hairless head after chemotherapy.
So blocking people coming to the governor's page, which is a public forum, formally described and run by staff members of the public who are paid tax dollars, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's women's spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's inquiries, claiming that blocking the comments was no more than regulating them.
But it's very easy to use images of trolls or spammers or hate people doing online verbal salutes.
The Post spoke with some of the real people who have been blocked by Hogan.
And these are real people who only speak to their elected leaders: A teacher, an office owner and a pope; not a tyrant.
All said their comments were not respectful, thoughtful and crazy.
The pope made a take from the Bible, speaking to Hogan's Catholic faith in sharing.
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, a lawyer from Maryland Bowie, was not hate but asked about hate crimes.
"Nazik I commented that I was disappointed that he had been unanswered by hate crimes and other recent reports," he wrote to the comments section of The Post's report.
"And when a lot of people comment on the same subject, I don't like the idea of being ignored by some as a collective effort into words rather than a large group of concerned citizens," he said.
Others who the governor's staff called an "intensified spam attack" will probably call it an "advocacy of ideas."
The Facebook era makes it easier for a message to be easily appropriated by blocking an insider or deleting a negative message.
It's much cleaner than in the old days when staff were sent outside to collect and burn papers where there were critical texts, or to arrest and silence protesters.
But that is exactly what has taken place, even if it is digital.
Hogan is not the first public post to be criticized for incriminating Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked in the Twitter flow.
One of the decisions that could be a reference to this issue in the future came from Virginia last week.
The chair of the Board of Auditors for the Loudoun Administrative District was in violation of the First Constitutional Change when it banned a voter on Facebook, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria.
In Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (Republican) was also visited by the ACLU over the use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
Washington time, the affordable postal takeover had quite a similar effect on the internet.
Between 1775 and 1800, the number of newspapers doubled to four, and the letter writers, whose name is unknown, overcame his leadership.
Even then, Washington had tattoos, whose name was unknown.
All of the people who used niche names such as "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to newspapers that put Washington's decisions under their feet.
Petitions criticizing his stance on the Friendship, Trade and Navigation Agreement with the UK had bungled his office, according to the online George Washington articles Project, which collected historical documents.
But it didn't silence them.
Freedom of expression, opposition and empowerment is at the very root of our nation.
Real leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes he will be in the comfort of his home at Renaissance Club
Ronan Rafferty, a former European number one, is hoping he will be in the comfort of his home in the next three days as he hosts the 25th edge of the Renaissance Club, Scottish Senior Open in South Lothian.
Northern Ireland, who reached the final by leading the next door before losing to Paul Eales at Archerfield Links, feel a commitment to the new venue and act as an ambassador for the tournament on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched the building of the Renaissance Club, and with this organization, we see it getting its spectacle," Rafferty said.
The players will see the field in its best form, in a fantastic situation.
Jerry has done a fantastic job of setting up this place.
He's a relentless advocate for this game and he's proud of his success here.
That's a great show for this field. "
England's Eales has won both the Europen Tour and the European Challenge Tour, but will struggle to retain a title for the first time in his 32-year career.
"It feels really special," said the Southport based actress.
"I had no chance of protecting the Extremadura Open because it was removed from the calendar after the year I won," he said.
It's so nice to be back in this part of the world.
It's a great place to play golf.
Memories are reeling from last year and for me and my wife, Sharon, winning last year was very charming.
It was special and it was a time when we will always be remembered for love. "
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 earlier this year, is also making a comeback to the game on his home ground.
It will be the first Scotland event since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"When you fight inside, it always means a little bit more," said Helensburgh man Orr.
"You want to do well, but you also feel the extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I played awesome golf.
I am happy with the progress so far. "
Participants in the three on the field are former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and Senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scots in the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Attendance is free and there is parking; it's charged $10 per vehicle, with five people and two or more people per vehicle where one person is.

I found the response
Imagine a "column..." Budget; with 6 billion 867 million Turkish Lords, more than the budget for each of the ten ministries, including the Economy, Development, Energy and Natural Resources, Science Industry and Technology, Environment and Environmental, Health, Culture and Tourism Ministries!
Staff numbers 117,378.
Turkey's biggest "propaganda base!"
Yes, I'm talking about the Office of Religious Affairs!
Yes, I'll talk about Religious Affairs Chairman Mehmet Gorsuch!
For days... I'm looking for answers to the question in my head...
I wonder about the real reason why Mehmet Gorsuch was taken out of his seat....
I read every article that came out about him being sent off.
It doesn't exist.
I can't find any answer to the question I'm looking for.
Just earlier this year...
Mehmet Gorsuch has drafted the 2017-2021 Strategic Plan of the Office of Religious Affairs (DIB).
A £1m S 600 model Mercedes was pulled under by President Erdogan.
I mean, he had no problem with Erdogan.
But what happened?
"You can say," Is it enough to have been in office for seven years? "
Ms. Rifat Brewer, president of the first DIB, served for 17 years.
Mehmet Nuri Yilmaz, you all know, sat for 11 years in that seat.
So... the president's term in office is open.
I'm back in charge again: Why did Mehmet Gorsuch leave his seat?
Business fell to deal with...
Shiite proximity
The source close to the administration said: "According to the Self-uproar, Mehmet Donmez didn't have the egg sauce!"
The code for this script is: He didn't have Sunrise!
The person who made this joke tweeted back: "Modernist found by Self-ulema!"
So, Mehmet Gormez was seen as innovative.
What was it to say, innovation?
The answer was hiding on a domestic trip by Mehmet Gorsuch.
Date: December 27, 2015.
Mehmet Gorsuch traveled to Iran to attend the 29th Wahdet Conference in Tehran - which aims to bring Islamic sects closer.
He met with Iran's religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Hamaney.
He paused with Shiite clerics and prayed.
And he said at the conference: "Graduates are the five shuttles that have formed over time, representing different ideas and conviction in understanding the religion of Islam."
The aim of all is to determine the expedition up to God.
Each one is an instant road distance up to the main road, but where they will arrive is the same.
It is never acceptable to mirror the sectarian religion, or to see sectarian sect, above Islamic audacity.
Segregation based on graduation, loneliness and conflict are a reflection of grace and ignorance.
The religion itself has been the hardest hit in the way graduates go before religion....
I want to stress again, underlining here:
Shiites and Sunnis are a single Promise...
"No one can tempt somebody else for mocking Islam as he understands..."
A year later...
Only Xhaferi leader Selahattin Ozdayz of Turkey attended the 30th Vahdet Meeting.
That is...
Vehhabilik, not Sunnis
Mehmet Gorsuch's trip to Iran, and his speech at the conference, made him the target of "traditional uproar."
Representing the Turkish State to the next Tehran conference - again - it was that no one attended.
Already, Mehmet Gorsuch hasn't gone, having been invited four times since taking office.
The cause was clear; the Shiite in the DIB - the anti-Iranian "traditional ulema!"
In the immediate aftermath of his trip to Iran, from early 2016, Mehmet Gorsuch's seat began to wane.
At the beginning of this was Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus, who was in charge of the DIB - his turn!
Mehmet Gorsuch drowned so much that he wanted to "let the DIB be tied to the Presidency."
At the core of it...
Within the state, there was a discrepancy when it came to the view of Sunrise.
Some "traditional ulema," whose theoretical worlds were created in Saudi Arabia and Egyptian media, was synonymous with Sunrise - in the shadow of the United States - Vehhabi-Selefilik!
These were Iranian opponents who did not even have a commitment to a trip to Tehran.
His remarks about Mehmet Gormez were not surprising: "There has been no danger to Republicans from that."
"My recollection is that vatana is attached to the nation and a wonderful reis loyal to Ehlisunnette is nasty..." he said.
"Ehlisunni" was using it as a symbolic concept of Iranian hostility.
New figures were now running the Iranian dissent, which was once made by FETIC - supported by the CIA.
And with FETIC sandwiches...
A photo of a teenager with a body in his arms was served to the media with the denial of "Mehmet Gorsuch's son!"
Oh, what a coincidence!
Who has made the biggest opposition to Mehmet Gorsuch in the media: Turkey, the newspaper of the U.S.-based Irishman Community!
After all...
Pm Sunrise resists not bringing Saudi Vehhabi-Selefi line...
Pm's not fuelling muscle separation...
- modernist... a cleric was destroyed by "traditional ulema," whose consciousness was created during the Cold War...
Us cultural empowerment continues to rapidly ramp up Turkey (Vehhabi-Selefi).
You will no doubt be the Vehhabi-Selefi representative of the future head of Religious Affairs!

Faulty and Death in Indonesia's Golden Diet
Bardina Degei doesn't use oak when cooking food.
Indeed, he rarely uses a knife.
The housekeeper puts a sweet potato directly over fire in Papua, Indonesia's disgruntled region, in his wooden home in Enarotali in Paniai namesake, often known locally as a "note."
Half an hour later, the knitted egg is picked up and slapped and swept away by the appetite, hands unwashed.
Degei sits on the muddy ground, where she does kangaroo things like washing wash with bleached water from the nearby blanket, with no furniture at all.
A kayak in the Catalan house serves as a field helmet.
As the youngest of her husband's four carers, she has not been served in any field.
The Co-op is a regular here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most of the men in the village are unemployed and most drink a lot, and then there are soldiers.
"No one walks around the village after 5 a.m.," she said.
It's a rare instant view of daily life in the mountainous areas of Papua, a former Dutch colony absorbed by Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum in which only 1026 elderly people were forced to vote by forced seizure as umpires before the units occupied.
An existing movement propagating independence against the Dutch administration has swiftly turned its ire on the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region, banning foreign journalists or rights surveillance organizations.
In 2003, the region was officially separated as Papua and West Papua, in a way that the independent Papua New Gine would occupy the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as unworkable as it is far away; the journey here involves a 90-minute flight from the regional capital, Jayapura, to Naeque, and a five-hour drive drive that tumbles into the mix with a rental vehicle.
No public transport.
The 19,000-strong resort includes wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and solar-powered iron roofs have been turned into a variety of garlic brown tones by the pitch.
Leave journalists, very few Indonesians have traveled here and virtually no foreigners have traveled here.
Before the Christian Missionaries arrived, he taped the Mee Pago Papuals to a goddess called Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," Degei says of her vibrant colours, touching palm, sheer skirt and bright ear.
"We'd just wear leaves on our body beforehand," he said.
Papua is the poorest region in Indonesia, with 28% of people living below the faulty border and the worst plumbing death and readership rates in Asia.
But at the same time, this is Indonesia's golden bottom.
Grasberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a mountainous area in New Jersey dimensions and home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport released gold and copper worth $3.1 billion to the taxpayer from here.
In addition, Papua has timber reserves estimated at $78 billion.
But these riches, a source of misery for the Papuans, allow Indonesia's powerful military to maintain a straight presence.
The New York Times study in 2005 reports that Freeport paid about $20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including sums of up to $150,000 for a single officer.
The Papuans' call for more automation threatens this golden egg chicken and comes from their merciless rights.
Since 1969, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by the Indonesian military, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned, according to rights activists.
Mass killings in the mountainous parts of Papua in the 1970s reached genocide figures, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peaceful demonstrators in the area last year alone.
The Archbishop of Brisbane's "We're going to lose Every Child" report in 2016 includes witnesses to graduation committed the previous year, including unlawful executions, torture (according to another report, death by rape and electricity is particularly popular) and the brutal crushing of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to calculate the number of victims because there are incidents every week," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesia researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Pressure has been heightened because Papua's resources have brought in settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
The region's population of 3.5 million is 83% Christian, but demographics are changing as extravagant migrants from Indonesia's crowded islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi arrive for economic purposes.
Javali warung buckets sell gado-gado, served with ground beef sauce mixed with fried chicken and vegetables.
Locals are finding it hard to compete.
"Migrants sell chickens and vegetables cheaper than local Papuans in traditional markets," explains Abeth You, 24, the landlord of Paniai, who has moved to the regional capital, Jayapura, for work.
"This has led to the loss of the marketplace of local Papuans, the Papuan mama-mammals (women)," he said.
The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, better known as Jokowi, vowed during his 2014 election campaign to address inequalities and rights violations in Papua.
The former anchor was on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta, with 27 of Papua's 29 regions, including Panaia, getting the vote.
But little has changed in Papua and today locals feel deceived.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 in anticipation that it would realise our hope that justice would be restored," You says.
In fact, Paniai suffered its worst condition just two months after Jokowi took office in October.
Two Indonesian military careers wound up on a motorcycle as they sang Christmas songs in front of a festive fire in Enarotali outside a group of 11 children on December 7, 2014.
The frightened children told them they needed to open up their futures.
One of the soldiers included them in their base and, according to local pope Yavedt Tebai, later returned with four soldiers.
Victims and witnesses said the soldiers, who had been drinking, chased the group and beat them with their rifles' digs.
Then one of the soldiers fired at the group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, had been beaten so badly that he went into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby government electoral commission building was set on fire and events escalated the next day.
Up to 1,000 Papuan men, women and children gathered to demand justice on a football field outside the local police station and a military command centre.
They were carrying ceremonial aerial peaks and they had the waita dance of Papua's Mee Pago ability (by running in the way of the public and installing the bird outing).
Some protesters began throwing stones at police and the military garrison.
As the nerves dropped further, an order was sent to soldiers through drone radio: "If the crowd showed more than three times of resistance, shoot them and kill them." Such was an official paperwork seen by Time, which was not disclosed to local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood in Enarotali, saw the impending danger and demanded calm by waving to the crowd to return home.
No one had any intention of listening.
"When I came back, I was shot from multiple left foot," she explained to Time in the presentation of her wooden house, painted with bright colors.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from a gathered military eruption
"It was heartbreaking, fired a lot of times," he adds.
Local Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who was shocked by the attacks.
Like many Indonesians, Yohanes, who is known only by one name, sarcastically explained to Time: "I ran Ona and examined her body to make sure if she was the one."
"I saw him die... I kissed him," he said.
Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers were only "securing" the station, because the station was under attack.
"When people threaten to kill us, we have to defend ourselves," Papua police spokesman Chief Superintendent Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"This is a matter of death."
Five young protesters were killed and many wounded, according to Human Rights Watch.
News of the deaths reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an enthusiastic speech in Jayapura in which he said he shared the plight of the victims' families and vowed to resolve the historic abuses in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so it won't happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Wiranto said he had set up a non-criminal mechanism for historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most of the expulsions were long ago.
Some are in the 90s and some in the early 2000s.
The issue is that we are committed to solving these breaches, but there are processes that we have to go through, "he said.
Speaking to Time on June 5, Wiranto hit back, saying there was no plan to set up a complaints mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "it will all be solved by the law," he said.
Eleven cases of human rights violations in Papua, including the Paniai case, have already been resolved, said Wiranto, whose B.M. was accused of "crimes against humanity," alluding to more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999.
The families of the Paniai victims have welcomed such claims with bitter skepticism.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress," says Yohanes.
"I was tired."
Years later, she says she still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," she said.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by a soldier, I'm afraid of being shot," he said.
His brother Yacobus repeats his view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the case.
He says he was beaten by a soldier after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After we buried the bodies, the soldier came looking for me," she said.
The attacks have yet to stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at villagers in Paniai's neighbor Deiyai namesake.
One person was killed and 17 others, including children, were injured during a confrontation between villagers and the director of a construction company that refused to help a man who was not on his own being taken to hospital.
Ravianus Douw, 24, who drowned in a nearby lake while fishing, died on his way to hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the company's site office.
Police said villagers threw stones at officers, and they responded by firing a warning shot.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) opened fire on the crowd and killed someone.
"We were very panicked, feared there would be revenge," recalls Dominggu Badii Time, 29, who lives close to the hospital and was shocked that the injuries had been raised.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days," he said.
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved in the job to be held accountable and for the mobile police brigade to withdraw from the area.
Paniai has always been a problematic area for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal cabin peoples, who live in disarray along Papua's green mountainous centre.
Many have joined the rebel army Free Papua Movement (OPM), which claims Papuans protect their rights by carrying out random attacks and abduction raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some top OPM leaders, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya, come from Paniai.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and held arbitrarily by soldiers in recent years under the guise of "protecting national sovereignty."
Some never see it again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as a "tragic and forgotten place."
Faulty feeds dissatisfaction.
The decadent rice on sale in Enarotali is too expensive for landlords to buy.
Bread is inaccessible.
People here grow everything they eat: Basically, the note, as well as some fruit and leaves vegetables.
Farming is the work of women who can snap up a sweet potato with four or five fields.
They usually store most of the harvest for the family, and sell the rest in the local market.
The £10 note is just 10,000 Indonesian Rupiahs (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between local Papuans and new migrants arriving in greater numbers since the opening of new air routes to Nawhe Airport.
Jobs that are already few usually go to immigrants who are better educated and richer.
It is very rarely the capitalists or the necessary lyrics of Papuans to run their own business as competitive.
"Young people do not have an interest in staying in the village because there is no job or money here," says John Gobai, head of Panai cabin council.
Isolation keeps the world's eyes away from Papua.
Other than that, the limitations of reporting for the international media remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalist Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for a "lack of coordination with the relevant institutions," despite a rare permission to film video given to them.
According to Phelim kine, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's election campaign has not been carried out to remove the limitations of reporting and development to increase transparency.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's disgraced eastern serviceable villains Papua and Western Papua: Visa rejection and being blacklisted," he said in a statement.
The lack of a media audit means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is mostly limited to its neighbors just near Papua.
In March, he encouraged six Pacific nations (Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands) to investigate "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Panaia attacks.
The same countries historically support OPM.
"The democratic system in Indonesia is still valid and there is free media so the evidence in human rights cases is difficult to cover," Arrmanatha Nasir, a spokesman for Indonesia's Foreign Ministry, told reporters in Jakarta, and did not care about the group's claims.
Locals want more foreign governments to deal with.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands visited Jayapura on May 4th, led by the country's human rights envoy, Kees Van Baar, locals broke their silence with the beginnings of "We want freedom," according to a source who attended the meeting and did not want to be named.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say there is little chance that they will vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person with good intentions, but it is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai attack," says Gobai, head of the cabin council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai, apart from living under the imminent threat of the hardship soldier, are rolling in faulty envelope with sore education and health care.
Like other Papuans, Gobai says, Paniai people see their own vote as a "debt" to pay back to Jokowi.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," she said.
Despite the threats and hacking, the families of the victims of the Paniai attack have carried out a final symbolic counterinsurgency: Burying a victim's body to land opposite the police and troop station.
Knowing that justice may never be met, they will at least make sure that those responsible do not forget about their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus, head to head.
"What else can we do?"

Fire engulfs Dubai's' torch 'skyline for second time
On Friday in Dubai, a fire ravaged the world's highest residential towers and forced hundreds of residents to flee the 337-foot-long 79-storey structure.
This is the second major fire to spread rapidly into the high building, which has been dubbed a torch tower in two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and there was no explanation for the cause of the massive fire.
"We were sleeping and woke up to a fire alarm, people were crying," he said.
We ran down the stairs and it took around 10 minutes for us to reach the 50th floor, "a quiet who gave his name as George told Reuters.

The government said it was trying to provide shelter for those affected.
The incident could raise questions about the safety of the malware used in the outskirts of high buildings worldwide.
The tornado management's investigation following the fire in 2015 found that most of the damage was in captivity - external panels used for decoration and isolation.

More than 4,000 chronic patients hailed for 'benefits
4,300 tuberculosis and SSPE patients will benefit from the benefit program, which will be launched by the Department of Family and Social Policies for poor residents and their families struggling with chronic diseases.
With the assistance program, the Department plans to give patients monthly support over two-thirds of the minimum wage, and will also provide regular psychosocial support.
Details of the "New Social Assistance Program for Families Against Kronic Disease," which recently began work under the direction of Family and Social Policies Minister Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya, were unclear, according to the report.
The welfare programme, launched with the Department of Health to support citizens struggling with chronic illnesses, economically and psychologically, is the first in the world in many ways.
Completing all the preparations for the launch of the program, the Department will also provide families with regular psychosocial support, not just transfers, through the welfare program.
It aims to ensure that poor residents who have chronic illnesses and continue their treatment processes at home and their families are not left alone, both financially and morally.
According to studies, the first stage will provide regular psychosocial and transplant support for poor citizens struggling with Subakut Sklerozan Panensefalit (SSPE), a brain disease caused by tuberculosis and upset microbiome.
Later in the program, poor residents who are struggling with other rare and risky diseases will be covered by the assistance program.
In addition to the planned support for a rate of more than two-thirds of the minimum wage, additional payments could be made to tuberculosis patients identified by the health unit, where they are unable to address their medical self-care, keep their lives dependent on bed or need to improve their home living conditions.
To benefit from the support, the household seeks a requirement that the monthly income per capita is less than two-thirds of the monthly net consistency of the minimum wage.
In addition, citizens with SSPE must find a health board report based on procedural and espionage outlined in the "Regulation of Health Board Report, which will be measured, classified and tailored to liberty."
More than 1 in 5 US passengers bring banned substances on board, survey finds
More than 20 per cent, knowingly or unknowingly, have missed banned substances to the plane from the checkpoints of the US Transportation Security Agency, including at least 6 per cent carrying banned bats or other sharp objects without knowing it, according to a survey of airline passengers.
Less than 1 per cent later claimed to have noticed that he was mistakenly traveling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The research, conducted by the jet rental service Stratos Jet Charters, with more than 1,000 people, has also found that younger travellers are more likely to break the rules.
Among respondents who admitted to trying to fly knowingly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 per cent are from the Y generation, so fewer than 15 are members of the X generation.
The most general substances knowingly missed from TSA agents are food and liquids.
More than 3 per cent admitted knowingly suffering sharp allowances from safety, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also admitted to knowingly carrying banned drugs on board.
The firm said it had surveyed passengers across the country to find how many people had mistakenly brought illegal goods from airport security and how many of them had done so knowingly.
It's no surprise that the most likely people to pass illegal goods from security, knowingly or unknowingly, are the most fleeting.
Still, as the firm put it, the TSA rules are a piece of rough and confusing.
Most of the time, people aren't sure what liquids or how much they can carry from them.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of substance seized by the TSA has emerged as banned liquids.
For a while, people thought that the TSA may be treating books as illegal goods.
The liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but are not allowed in international ones.
China welcomes US statements positively
At a news conference in the capital Beijing, Chinese Foreign Minister Vang Yi expressed concern at Tillerson's remarks, attributed to the Pyongyang administration: "The change of regime, the collapse of the regime, the peninsula going quickly to reunification, and we are not seeking an excuse to send our troops north of the 38th parallel."
Chinese Foreign Minister Vang said Tillerson had re-emphasized the Washington administration's principles for the North Korean issue, and that he hoped the United States would implement those principles effectively and in a policy focused on concrete results.
Noting that the security of the Korean peninsula is their priority, Vang stressed that he expects the parties to find the middle way in which they can resolve their concerns through equal dialogue, and that Beijing's administration has been adamant ever since that the peninsula is free of nukes, maintaining peace and stability, solving problems through dialogue and negotiation.
EPA Chief Pruitt Takes Over Obama Era Emission reduction laws
A day after it was sued by 15 counties, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Organization, reversed a previous decision to delay the implementation of Obama era laws that reduced air polluting emissions that caused pit smoke.
Pruitt represented change as his own organisation is more sensitive to the needs of provincial environmental regulators than past administrations.
He never mentioned the issue of legal appeal filed in a federal high court against his own previous position.
What is at stake is that counties are beginning to meet October 1, the end of the 2015 standards for ground level ozone.
Pruitt announced that he would delay hazardous compliance by one year to give his own organization more time to work the plan and avoid "interfering with local decisions or curbing economic growth."
Before his appointment by President Donald Trump, Pruitt, Oklahoma's state attorney general, had long served as a reliable ally against tighter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has moved several times to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden change is Pruitt's latest legal defeat for his agenda of rolling back the regulation.
Last month, a federal high court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator's attempt to delay the practice, which demands that oil and gas firms, an Obama administration law, oversee and reduce methane leaks, exceeded the limits of its own authority.
In a statement released Wednesday evening, Pruitt said the reversal of ozone standards reinforced the EPA's commitment to only meet the counties at the time of the new standards and work through complex processes.
Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job, said: "Under previous administrations, the EPA would often fail to meet the final dates of decisions, wait to be sued by activist groups and others, and would be happy to resolve the dispute to adjust the timing for the decision."
"We do not believe in the arrangement through suing, and we will take the dates of the Terror seriously.
We will also take seriously the law and the authority it gives to us. "
Still, the EPA's statement said Pruitt could use his "authority to delay" once at some point, and all the other authority that is legally available, to ensure that regulations are "supported by robust policies and the best information available."
Republicans in Congress are pressing for a broader rewrite of ozone laws.
A House bill passed last month is striving for the implementation of the 2015 laws to be delayed by at least eight years.
The measure has yet to be brought to the Senate for a vote.
Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general who led a coalition of counties that sued the EPA this week, said the group was intent on maintaining legal pressure.
Schneiderman said: "Following our cases, the EPA's change of judgment is a significant win for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who have been directly affected by the pit smoke flowing into their communities."
In the case, New York was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont.
Ozone at ground level is created when overall pollutants are released by cars, power plants, oil refineries, cherry facilities and other sources who react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting pit smoke can cause serious breathing problems in a group of people who are affected quickly and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists applauded Pruitt's surprise decision change.
Lori Ann Burd, of the Centre for Biodiversity, said: "It is disturbing that so much pressure is needed to achieve this health-care step from the person tasked with protecting the air we are soliciting."
"We must continue to fight against the ideological struggles of the Trump administration to belittle those who pollute the environment and interest groups," he said.
Inflation single households
Turkey, which saw its biggest increase in exports in six years in July, pushed unemployment to 10.5 per cent in the oceans, and its economic confidence index also rose to a 3.5 year high, bringing inflation down to a single digits.
The Consumer Price Index (TUFE) rose 0.15 per cent on theirs, while annual inflation jumped to single digits for the first time since January at 9.79 per cent, according to data released yesterday by the Turkish Bureau of Statistics (TNC).
As of the main spending groups, theirs was in the group of restaurants and hotels, with the highest monthly increase of 1.75 per cent, while the group that declined the most was clothing and shoes at 3.51 per cent.
The highest year-on-year increase was in the transport group at 15.24 per cent.
"In the moderate trajectory of inflation, there is an impact on the slump in prices for food and clothing groups," said Muammer Bridges, a Business Investment Economist, noting that inflation in theirs, in line with expectations, has dipped into the single digits.
However, there is a rise in core indicators compared to the previous month, unlike the headline.
"We don't expect there to be a loosening of the hard stance of the Central Bank," he said.
Despite the drop in headline inflation, there has been a rise in core inflation indicators.
The B index of specialized TUFE indicators, which is also closely watched by the Central Bank, rose from 9.07 per cent on theirs to 9.46 per cent, from 9.20 per cent to 9.60 per cent.
"Inflation could fluctuate by December and fall into the single digits in December."
"The Central Bank could get an opportunity as of the early months of 2018," he said in a statement.
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek: Inflation will close the end of the year with a single digit.

Development Minister Lutfi Elvan: There may be some upward trend in annual inflation due to the blockbuster effect in the coming months, but the decline in inflation from the early months of 2018 will be uncertain.
We anticipate that annual inflation will come down further.

Sick relatives break doctor's neck
Doctors and employees at Turkey's High Excellence Training and Research Hospital briefly left work yesterday morning, in response to the smashing of a doctor's friends by sick relatives.
Crowds gathered outside the hospital's main entrance, holding signs reading "No to violence in the street," in response to the incident.
The hospital's Clinical Chief of Child Cardiology, Dr Feyza Ayshenur Pac, said: "The slogan" No to violence in health "seems to me to be inadequate or even a bipartisan slogan."
In health, there can be no place for the violent label.
"If it goes that way, this public will not be able to find a health guru who will soon be self-serving," he said.
The medics' action was supported by Ankara City Health Director Dr. Kamil Turkmen, Professor Oner Odabashi, secretary general of Ankara First Regional Public Medicine, Turkey's High Excellence Training and Research Hospital, and patient relatives in the hospital yard.
Pross, who condemned the incident, said.
Unfortunately, violence against health workers is growing.
We have experienced one example of this incident yesterday (the day before) in the evening, when our cardiovascular surgery physician was crushed by a patient burglar.
We have taken the measures we can as our state, ministry and governor for these events to end as soon as possible, but we are also demanding that our people's desperation to do so.
I condemn yesterday's events on behalf of my hospital and health workers.
"Unfortunately, this has become a professional complication, which we occasionally experience," he said, noting that society needs to be conscious about violence in health.
"And we will take our own measures, but the most important thing is that our nation has its own health care," he said.
The criminal process in the case is under way, Turkmen said. "Our laws on violence in the judiciary have been effective enough."
The ranks of the state are implementing it.
At the moment, the police are working.
In the past, they have always been in vain, but at the moment there is a direct public case and the state is hiring a lawyer, following the case.
"There are also severe penalty samples taken about it," he wrote.
Following the revelations, the employees continued to work.
The alleged incident took place at about 17: 45 the previous day.
Relatives of the patient, who died in intensive care, attacked Dr Hamdi Mehmet Ozbek, who worked for the Heart and Damar Surgery department, who reported his death.
He was escorted from the scene by doctors and assistants; police were called to the hospital.
Ozbek's neck was broken in the incident, and the attackers were taken into custody.
A doctor, a witness to the incident, said.
When our friend went to the care of sick relatives to report the condition of a patient who died, sick relatives blamed our friend and us and attacked two of our friends.
Our friend's neck was broken, and she stayed in the woods.
Then we took our friend inside the surgery and hid it.
For 15 to 20 minutes, security drew a seal to us.
If sick relatives had crossed that safety wall, there would have been a lot worse things.

YPG looting in Syria...
United intervened
YPG terrorists have ravaged the homes of residents of the Tel Semin resort, in the northern countryside of Rakka, where the United States is engaged in military support, on the grounds of fighting the terrorist group IS, according to local sources.
The reaction of civilians whose homes were looted and seized has turned into clashes with the terrorist group.
Us forces in the area then entered the resort with armoured vehicles.
The "Cougar MRAP" type of armor, staff-carrying vehicles and Husky type mine setting tools were found to create a buffer zone at the resort.
The terror group YPG does not allow civilians fleeing death in Rakka, which has come under fire as part of an anti-IS crackdown, to enter the cities under its control.
The local activist network, "Rakka is silently slaughtered," announced yesterday that 121 civilians were killed in the organization's artillery fire in August alone.
Let's not take the old world's fights to tomorrow
The delayed perception of domestic and world realities could lead to crises in countries as well, not same-sex people.
One of the reasons the reclusive East, which we describe as "Sharing," perceives world realities by delay, may be that the relevance of these facts to the geographies of the East is blocked by certain chambers or announced in real terms.
Don Kisot and Oblomov have also been the subject of the literary world to perceive reality and change by delay, or not at all.
Cervantes's "Don Kisot" is a metaphor in the cycle, when scholarship begins to form, that still makes him think of a shirt.
Or Goncharov's "Oblomov" is a clever legacy that, when he ignored the facts, he thought it could last as it was before.
Chinese example Mesela China is open to the world by the end of the 15th century, and while it is a sovereign country to the seas, it has closed in as a result of a passionate dynasty going into the woods.
This has relied on the death of captains of boats out of Chinese territorial waters.
With one leg, eyes and glasses in the West, and the other leg, eyes and glasses in the East, we Turks have had constant dilemmas about perceiving facts and change, starting with the Empire.
We have tried to bring the world of an old and new episode to date, to understand today with concepts that fit old conditions, to think about yesterday tomorrow.
One episode is that when it comes to perceiving domestic and world realities, as well as change, we have been able to act as fast as the focus of thinking in developed countries.
This has been a source of constant conflict, tensions.
College with the media, the modern army with newborns, susceptible encounters with faith, led to a dramatic content duplication.
Progressivism is even worse, and the hearings, which were new and advanced at a time, were also not accepted that they would be escorted and left behind at the end of certain periods of time.
After a period of time, the progressives of yesterday began to declare the new and advanced, "Three," and "Hain," as they tried to interpret domestic and world conditions in line with the current reality.
The most important lesson is that those who dismiss the realities of home and world in the Empire by delay dominate thought and state life, eventually the empire fell apart, collapsed and the public became impoverished.
The most important lesson of our Ottoman past to the Republic was the fact that the rapid perception of the world's congestion and change is an inevitable prerequisite for survival.
Since this lesson is very well sacrificed, we have been able to become an exemplary country of this geography, which has so far managed to preserve its unity, integrity, stability in peace from the 1st World War.
In order for us to survive the process of global change that is embedded in a different approach to survivors and survivors, we also need to put the tackles behind them and be compatible with the facts.
In other words, there will be no to anyone from carrying the meaningless campaigners and blood cases to date, which in the past have led to the toppling of our democracy.
And in today's world, the smallest failures lead to huge and dramatic crises.
The most problematic geography about that is the Middle East, which we are in.

Turkey wind
Relying on Turkey's future, the global giants struggled to break in yesterday's wind farm auction.
A world record was broken in the auction with the model created by the Department of Energy and Natural Resources to make a transition to national energy by reducing outsourcing.
The tender, which will bring down Turkey's energy costs, also paved the way for a $1 billion investment and up to 4,000 jobs.
Local production wind turbines will be incorporated into the system by early 2019.
Eight consortia, including US, Chinese, German and Danish giants, took part in the tender for a renewable resource areas (YEKA) wind plant licence, which was opened by the Department of Energy and Natural Resources.
The tender opened financial bidding envelopes in a bid to determine the five bidders who first made the lowest bid.
After the initial bidding treats, the lowest bid was $4.19 / kWh.
The open screen range was set at 0.01 cents.
Once the tender began, the joint venture groups, which include Enercon, Gold Wind, GE, Senvion and Vestas, decided not to participate in the auction.
Groups including Siemens, Nordex and Mingyang competed in the auction.
MingYang-First Construction and Siemens-Turkerler-Kalyon were the last two after the consortium where Nordex was also pulled out.
MingYang-First Construction has taken a break 11 times.
The Siemens-Turker-Kalyon Energy consortium never used a break.
Energy and Natural resources Minister Berat Albanese: A record day for Turkey.
The open screen continued 30 rounds.
The winner of the intense confrontation between the two consortia was the Siemens-Turkerler-Kalyon joint venture group, which had the lowest bid of $3.48 cents / kWh.
The consortium offered $3.49 cents / kWh at the auction, while the tender commission, headed by Assistant Chief Constable Alparslan Bayraktar, withdrew its bid to 3.48.
With the result in the two-hour YEKA auction, Turkey achieved a world record.
$3.48 / cents per kilowatt offered in the tender made history as the world's lowest figure in this area.
The previous record was held by Mexico at $3.84 / cents per kWh.
At a press conference following the conclusion of the tender, Energy and Natural Resources Minister Berat Albanese said winning the competition by the German company Siemens was an important message to the region and the world. "Looking at Turkey and Germany's 200-year historical co-operation, I think this result will be an important contribution to Turkish-German relations," he said.
Our goals are great.
What comes out today has revealed just how robust and confident steps the economy and energy market is moving into the future.
No matter how much regional crises in the world, I was very proud to put up with this tender that Turkey is leading the region and the world's most trusted investment countries.
"All of Turkey, in this painting, which we will be proud of at 80 million, the biggest contributor, within 15 years of power and leadership, is the president who led Turkey to this point," he said.
"One of the most important steps of this was the cost of buying $10.3 / cents per kilometre with domestic contributions in the wind up to yesterday, down from a world record of $3.48 / cents," he said, adding that he had launched a new era with the auction, which was open, transparent and comparable competition.
I'm proud of it, on behalf of my nation, for the sake of my country.
She said she aims to activate the first domestic production panels in solar power before the end of 2018, adding: "Hopefully by early 2019, we will incorporate our domestic production wind turbines in the system."
The turbines will be built in five designated zones.
The firm that won the competition will launch a 1,000-megawatt board force in total, with a requirement to build at least 50 megawatts of wind power in each of those five regions.
The total investment in the Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon group will be worth more than $1 billion.
With local wind power plants entering the business, a minimum of 3 billion kWh of electricity power will be produced each year, and the annual electricity needs of about 1.1 million homes will be covered by the wind.
There will also be an average of 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 / year emissions reduction thanks to future wind facilities.
The winning bidder will build a factory with investments of more than $100m.
The plant will produce an average of 300 to 450 domestic wind turbines, including at least 2.3 megawatts of power.
The consortium will conduct R & D work for 10 years in a total of five areas in at least three of the canvas, generator design, materials technologies and production techniques, software and innovative teeth box areas.
A budget of $5 million will be allocated each year for R & D work, with 50 technical staff, 80 per cent of whom are local engineers.
The plant will be built 21 months after the contract is signed.
The licensing period for the project is 30 years.
Kazim Turker, executive director of Turkers Construction, which is part of the consortium that won the tender, said domestic production will be around 64 per cent, while 35 per cent will come from abroad. "We plan to finance the equipment from foreign sources and the rest from local banks," he said.
He said the tender reflects confidence in the Turkish economy.
"It was a tender that would reduce Turkey's dependence on the outside by another 1,000 megawatts."
"We are pleased with the outcome," he added.
Siemens Gamesa Turkey Senior Administrator Hakan Yildirim also said they had been operating in Turkey for 160 years, adding: "We will do everything we can to lower the cost of power units."
The relocation rate for wind turbines to be produced at the plant will be a minimum of 65 per cent.
Of the 8,000 industrial pieces found in the wind turbine, 65 per cent will be local (at least 5,200 pieces).
At least 50 MW, a total of 1,000 MW will be built in each of the 5 regions.
10 years of R & D obligation of 3,750 jobs, $5 million to leave each year for R & D activities
The 1,000MW Round Reserve 65% Earth Forest is the production of 300 to 450 domestic wind turbines with at least 2.3 MWe power.
More than $1 billion in investment Years 400 MW / year wind turbine production capacity is more than $100 million worth of factory investment.
Electricity generation, which will cover the needs of about 1.1 million homes, is a minimum of 3 billion kWh of electricity power generation Organization 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 / year emissions reduction each year.

Moore's Ford massacre: Activists Reinvigorate racist Link Place for Adalete Count
A 1948 model Ford Mercury was passed among a group of spectators in the Monroe Georgia countryside and a tall marker proceeded toward the small Ford Bridge in Moore.
The car, with four black passengers and a white driver, came forward to cover the path of an armed group of white men before they reached the bridge.
The leader of the gang, a man in a middle-aged fine line team suit, took a long breath from his pram and looked carefully inside through the front glass.
Inside, those who sat were associated with fear.
"Right now, we want.., Roger!" The man barked.
"It's out of the car, it's him!" "
As a young black man was dragged out of his front passenger seat, the flashes were going through the dark desert.
Fortunately, this horrific scene on June 22 is just a revival.
But when a promo was thrown around the neck of "Roger," almost everyone from viewers gave it quite realistically solitary.
Since 2005, human rights activists have been returning to the Ford bridge in Moore, to revive the lynching of two black couples (Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey) by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
So far, no one has been charged with the killings.
Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the revival, said: "Although we see them in our communities, it does not characterize the fact that not a single person has been arrested for all these years, even though we know who they are."
"It's a leap on this date, but it's a burden on our Spirit," he said.
At the age of 71, Brooks was a former Georgia state congressman and a lifelong human rights activist.
For him, this revival is a call to a dramatic action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been fixed.
"We want to prosecute, we want results, we want the wounds to heal, we want reconciliation, but we have to get justice first," he said.
"We can't have it until we get justice to heal the wounds and compromise," he said.
The forensic tag puts a shirt on the body of one of the victims of the Ford lorry in Moore on July 27, 1946.
More than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding areas were suspected in the lineup, according to FBI files obtained by NBC News.
But even one has never been investigated.
The suspects remained on the run for decades, but human rights activists say the twin motivations of the linemen are always very well known all over town: Politics and sex.
In April 1946, a supreme court judgment made it possible for black residents in Georgia to vote in the primary at the end of that summer for the first time.
In virtually the same time as the election, black Orchestra Roger Malcom stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landlord, apparently in connection with a woman during a fight, according to the FBI.
Brooks said the episode in the town was that Hester was in bed with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and the baby she was carrying was not from her own husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a leading white landlord, paid $600 to get Malcom out of jail, according to the FBI.
Dorothy and her cousins, Mae Murray, have gone to jail in the George Dorsey refuge.
But when they arrived at the Ford Bridge in Moore as he walked away from prison with the vehicle, a lingerie gang surrounded the car.
"It is understandable that it was Harrison who arranged and ordered the killings," an FBI report concludes.
"Also, obviously, there was a secret agreement between the provincial and local arm forces, which not only involved in the murder, but destroyed evidence and hid the identities of witnesses," he said.
Brooks explained shorter and self.
He said: "This was a massacre of voting rights."
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you register and vote, that's what will happen to you,'" he said.
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has been leading a revival of the Ford Bridge lineup in Moore, which takes place every year.
His performance, given all the details, is notable and based on a deep kind of racism that many believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch and even harder to turn her looks, but Greene says that's the goal.
He said: "We don't want to talk about lynching because that's what confronts our tobacco with the bullying in our drinks."
"But if you don't listen to me or listen to what's happened to me, I can't develop a relationship with you," he said.
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, up to 30 actors (a dozen white and the rest black) walked into a room, and when Greene reluctantly embarked on the game's well-rehearsed general lines, they listened.
Wade Marbaugh is associate director of Greene.
Over the years, he has played the role of President Klansman, but he says the role has never been easier.
Marbaugh said: "I feel dirty because this is not me."
"But I think it's very important to keep this past alive because we don't want to go back to those times," he said.
The actors who played Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester throughout the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, were rehearsing their own selfies.
The game begins with Malcom shouting at Hester and pushing him as he is so furious that he is lying with his wife, Dorothy.
"Z.... i, knocked out of my property, I said!"
Rascona responds.
There's a shooting voice.
And then everyone (at least black actors) drops to the knee.
Most Greene laughs.
"What?!" Asked Rascona.
He was Teacher, surprised.
Am I too fortunate?
"No," Greene said in the clouds.
"I just don't think white people say z... i at the time," he said.
"Yes," said one of the black players, throwing mixed stones with a shotgun.
"You have to push the 'R'," he said.
Thus, the energy in the room changes and a form of sincerity replaces the unrest.
Everyone is dedicated to doing it right, not only for the fault of the game, but also for the memories of the four people killed.
The stage is resting.
This time around, he says the word that starts with Rascona N, sharp and emphatic.
Absolutely no one laughs.
The revival ends in a violent way and speedy.
There are flashes, gun fire and then silence.
A woman dressed in a funeral sidekick is standing on the actors' blessings and reads Billie Holiday's hilarious memoir, "Garip Meyva."
In one of both words, her voice is broken.
Face Yard is an average of four dozen audience members behind, weeping and wiping away tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost equally divided, in black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many of them from across the road.
While Brooks took them on a holy journey to the cemeteries of the Malcom and Dorsey, they were all based on Georgia's oppressive edge for almost eight hours.
Up to this point, the killings were left as an anecdotes, but standing in the same place where there is now lust means the weather seems to be adorable.
As the song's final notes are weakened, Greene invites the crowd to get closer and study the blessings.
The children wash their hands on, kick the fake knife and unaccompanied blessings and flip each other.
"They didn't really die," a little boy grins, as if remembering himself.
A few minutes later, Greene thanks the crowd and ends up multiple times.
The actors take the lingerie lead and wipe away tears.
Bradshaw is engulfed by team elder Marbaugh, who plays president Klansman.
Nick Rascona is engulfed by two of his fellow players and ages are divorced from his eyes on their arm, the emotional cost of the performance coming to him at last.
"It's not a problem," fumes one of the women.
"We know that's not what's in the heart of the show.
Do this for some reason. "
Later, viewers sit down to lunch with the actors.
At one table, the white couple, from Atlanta, barely chatter about the revival with a black couple.
Denise Duplinski finds it hard to find quotes about how the performance made her feel.
He said: "To hear these terrible, bereaved words and those behaviours... come out of people who look like you and they do them because they look like you."
"What this has done to me is for the linesmen to think that it is still going on," he added, "and they are now being tried only by the police."
At the end of the room, Tyrone Brooks is the focus when eating at his desk and understanding human rights memories.
He said he had already started planning for next year's performance.
He said: "The revival is inspiring in a sense because it weighs up what we've been catching up with, but it's also teaching."
"It seems like, if you don't learn from it, it could happen again.
Those who do not study their own backgrounds, who do not know their own past, are doomed to repeat it. "

To revive business, Pearson makes another 3000 job cuts, cuts profit share
Britannia education group Pearson said it would make another 3000 layoffs on Friday and cut its occasional profit share by 72 per cent as it embarks on another restructuring programme to overcome the pressures the business faces.
The layoffs, which will mostly come in late 2018 and early 2019, will be in addition to the 4000 positions lost in the previous restructuring, chief executive John Fallon said.
Pearson announced a plan in May that would save a further 300 million pounds ($394 million US) by experimenting with restoring the business, which has shifted rapidly to digital learning through a third cost reduction program.

Metin 2 took him to death again!
Hakan's death is suicide, according to initial findings in the preliminary autopsy report, according to an initial report by the Census Bureau.
A detailed examination found no trace of shots and pockets in the child's body.
The cause of suicide is that he was left breathing as the elastic bandage he grabbed on his neck tightened.
The beast, which his family described as a shaky beast, was also determined to be an elastic bandage used in the injury.
After a detailed report into the boy's death was prepared, the report, which said the incident was a suicide, was to be sent to the Metropolitan Public Prosecution Service, which is leading the investigation, according to newspaper Haberturk's Muslim Sariyar.
Police are investigating the boy's suicide with all the details, and examination of his computer, which was seized after the incident.
Police will also apply for testimony from Hakan "friends," it said.
It also states that a third person, or a gang, could be accessed with information from Hakan's computer, which neighbors said was "cleaned."
Police are assessing Hakan "may have been driving a gang to suicide."
The certainty that Hakan committed suicide turned his eyes on the violent Metin2.
Metin2, which has come under fire for causing addiction and violence in children, was banned by Antalya's governor last year from the age of 15, opened up about the murder of "mini-hacker" Metin Kang, also 13, in 2009.
In 2005, in order to play Metin2, designed in Korea, he needs to go on his site and register a member.
The players are trying to ensure peace and justice in the world with the Ejder goddess in the game.
In doing so, there are wars, and the dose of violence is on the rise.
The game also features images of war with intermittent, defiant weapons such as selfies, swords, pala, balls, as well as images of people being torn apart by wild animals and rendered their meat.
The actor buys characters with money to strengthen.
The family who buried their children the next day after the July 25 incident at the home in Esenyurt Explosive Challenge Content Street continued their alleged murder.
"The whole dream was to be a doctor, we don't think it could hurt him or someone else because of the game," said his father, Mehmet Ekinci, "but they pulled the elastic shaking on his neck and threw a wedge on the side."
It was found that way, my son.
We certainly don't think our son is capable of hurting him and someone else because of an online game and he can either commit suicide.
We were aware that he was playing a game like this.
It wasn't a game where he played havoc.
Yeah, he's got a bit of the cat out of the game to leave when he's tired.
Her mother, Gülizar Ekinci, said, "There is no getting in and out of the building."
At a certain hour, my child is said to have entered the house.
None of them hold each other.
When his dad came home, he had one seat.
"But when his body was found, he had 2 seats next to the computer," he added.
Ilker Karash says he may have been involved in gang
Families generally don't pay attention to this issue.
"They look like," If my child is at home or whatever it is. "
The boy has been communicating with a lot of people through games.
It may have been a lending situation there, or downsizing.
Or he has invited a man in the game to the house, and it may have been a problem between them.
He may have stayed in an impact, not because of the direct game but because of his problems with other people he communicated through the game.
The boy may have mocked the visibility of the game, its fiction.
The trauma that drove her to suicide may be about blackmail.
If the child has faced a state of being scared of the family, there is also a case of getting away with it because it cannot solve the problem.
He can't have committed suicide because of the game itself.
There is also the likelihood that the child will be bundled into the gang.
He may have been involved in the gang.
Individually, it can't be something the child may have done on their own.
IT systems consultant Four NEBIL says families should know their children's interaction
We can't say the games are harmful.
Studies also say the games are useful for children's development.
What's important here is that parents pay attention to what their children are playing and, honestly, how they talk to the players.
Families should know how children are affected by what content and take the measure.
There are only 2 children in five years in Turkey who are said to have died because of the vote.
This shows that ending a child's life is not just the impact of the games.
What was it that pushed this boy into that?
We must learn that first.
There is a need to look at the sociology and psychology around the child.
Stock market relies on 8 month yield in Istanbul to 50 per cent
The BIST 100 index continued its upward trend, which began in December 2016, in May, and pushed its rise to 8th in the top flight.
Thus, the index jumped 45.3 percent over the period as it posted a rise in eight months in a row for the first time since July 2007.
The BIST 100 index, which has outperformed the world's major stock markets, including Germany, the United States, Britain, Japan, for its performance since the start of the year, did not leave the lead on a yield basis in May.
The BIST 100 index, which ended July up 7.06 per cent, was up 2.54 per cent, followed by the Dow Jones index in the US and Britain's FTSE 100, up 0.81 per cent.
In altitude, the DAX index and Japan's Nikkei index finished the month of theirs with a loss of value.
As of January-July, the BIST 100 index showed a high performance from both the major world stock markets and emerging country stock indexes.
The BIST 100 index, up 37.6 per cent from its 2016 close this year, was followed by the Dow Jones index, up 10.76 per cent, the DAX index, up 5.55 per cent, and the Nikkei index, up 4.55 per cent, and the FTSE 100 index, up 3.21 per cent.
The benchmark MSCI EM index for emerging country stock jumped 23 per cent.
Based on the historical process of the BIST 100 index, it has shown similar performances in the past.
The BIST 100 index, which last finished eight months in a row between December 2006 and July 2007, was up 38.3 per cent over the period.
In addition, the BIST 100 index finished 8 months between August 1996 and March 1997, up in a row in the nine months between May 1997 and January 1998.
Meksa Investment Research Director Eren Can Umut told an AA reporter that the BIST 100 index has been on the rise for eight months, noting that since the start of the year, the rise has surpassed the 37 per cent mark.
He said the MSCI emerging markets (EM) index recorded a 23 per cent rise, with positive distraction, even when we look at those rates.
The flow of funds to developing countries has been going on since the start of the year.
In particular, funds in the search for higher yields prefer countries with higher interest rates.
As it stands, domestic markets are affected in a positive way.
Of course, the appetite to take risks on a global scale is a wonderful one.
That said, stock indexes with risky asset status are priceless.
In the US, the S & P 500 index has risen by close to 11 per cent since the start of the year, and we see new record highs being tested almost every week.
At the start of the year, he stressed that the US Central Reserve (Fed) had studied estimated markets for 3 rate hikes, but had used the Fed's verbal directive policy quite well to remove uncertainty, noting that there was a desperate market for the Fed to raise interest rates.
He said inflation in the United States is not yet at the desired level, but expectations that the Fed will not be rushed to raise interest rates and avoid radical moves are also highly effective at current pricing.
Us President Donald Trump's failure to cancel health care reform, known as "Obamacare," reinforces the perception that he can't deliver on his promises of widening finance policies, he said: "Thanks to any Trump, fast-growing US economy expectations make stocks markets positive at a time, but the failure of promises will be responded to faster growth and faster inflation."
He noted that 2016 was a year of many upheavals in terms of Turkish markets, and said the BIST 100 index, which was negative distractions and oversold, was in an effort to close the gap relative to its similarities.
He said he had not seen a strong recovery with out-of-pocket news flow, noting that the current outlook could be interpreted mainly as an increase in appetite for risk taking abroad, triggering domestic markets' willingness to close the gap based on their similarities.
He said he watched some snow sales on the BIST 100 index, which technically tested new records of 108,600.
The 109,500-110,000 area in particular is a critical threshold in the short term.
It's normal for snow sales to take place after it gets close to those levels.
In the short term, we think there should be a local or global new story for pricing of 110,000.
For now, a downward spiral of 107,500 support could trigger profit sales.
In this case, I think gearing up to 106,000-105,500 areas can be seen, even if we follow the support of 107,000.
Breaking 105,500 support, in particular, could bring a pullback to 104,300, a level that is credited with Fibo 50 per cent of the rise from 100,000 to 108,600.
Both the Fed and the European Central Bank's (ECB) resolutions will be at the forefront of the global market, he said, and expectations for the Fed are already clear, but a balance sheet reduction program is not expected to raise interest rates at the FOMC on Jan.
He said this could trigger profit sales in emerging country (GOC) stocks indexes, which are overshadowed in the short term, adding: "The main thing next to this is what the ECB is going to say."
After the July monetary policy board meeting, ECB President Mario Draghi said he would discuss the course of monetary policy in the autumn, a rhetoric that has allowed the euro / dollar parity to rise above 1.1700.
So statements on whether the £60 billion monthly asset purchase programme will be reduced or terminated will mean that on a global scale, post-Fed liquidity will also be reduced by the ECB.
"Therefore, negative pricing can prevail on the part of the country's markets, which provide a high current account deficit such as Turkey and have limited access to foreign funds," he said.
Erol Gurcan, director of Global Investment Investment Consulting, also said there had been a pretty serious rallying for global stock markets in the wake of Trump's election as president in the United States in November 2016.
Gurcan said it was possible to say that the main factor triggering this rallying move was developments that boosted expectations for global growth, particularly Trump's promises to cut taxes.
The stock market, Istanbul, was also at the forefront of emerging stock markets in the global rallying.
One of the main reasons is that the BIST 100 index has remained highly skewed in recent years compared to similar emerging country markets, but it is worth noting that steps taken by policymakers to support the economy and financial markets have also played a serious role.
In particular, we can say that the Credit Garanti Fund (KGF), which became active in March with a reputation, has a serious impact on the rise observed so far in the index.
For the remainder of the year, Gurcan reported that positive developments reflected substantially pricing and that the KGF, which has a key role in this rise, was also slowly reaching the doorstep, a new story for the rest of the year, although the BIST 100 index still remains isolationist compared to similar country markets.
In particular, Gurcan noted that developments such as the much-anticipated 180-day action plan to share details for some time, arrangements to support corporate profits, such as increasing the limit for the Credit Garanti Fund, and possible tax cuts raised recently, could make a positive contribution in this respect.
Gurcan stressed that the fact that key sophisticated country central banks such as the Fed, ECB and Bank of England (BoE) would also tighten current expansionary monetary policy hearings, albeit slowly, would still be among the key factors of risk for developing countries, "the Fed, which has continued its measured rate hikes for some time.
In possible correction moves in the index over the coming period, the 104,150-104,600 support zone, which corresponds to the 200-hour moving average with an upward trend since the beginning of the year, is critical, he said, adding that the correction movement could continue to 101,700, 100,000, 99,200, respectively, if that support zone is broken.
In the case of maintaining the current upward trend and breaking 108,605 resistance, the current historic peak level, the index could rise to 110,000-112,000, he said.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding a few, officials say.
In a statement, NATO said five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded.

The bombing is the latest act of violence in Afghanistan this month; more than 30 people were killed on Tuesday in a mosque blast in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
The NATO statement said Thursday's blast was attacked by a 'staff-driven improvised explosive device' on a joint patrol with the Afghan military.

Reporters say the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh is a major concern for NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
In the first half of 2017, according to the United Nations, Afghanistan has witnessed the deaths of at least 1662 civilians, with an average of 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in the mostly Shiite area of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out the attack themselves.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people in the deadliest militant attack in the country after U.S.-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.

EPA stop delaying dirty weather rule after lawsuits
The US Environmental Protection Organization returned, as 15 counties sued the organization over the initiative a day later, after a decision to delay a law demanding that counties block emissions that cause pit smoke.
The EPA announced its decision late on Wednesday that the organization would continue with its "2015 Ozon HQ," saying it showed its commitment to working with the counties.
"We believe in dialogue with our provincial parliamentarians and to be sensitive to them," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA's intention to delay ozone decisions by one year until October 2018; with these decisions, current pit smoke pollution is measured across the country, and where cuts are mandatory to meet more challenging air quality standards.
The 15 counties, mostly Democratic, and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit on Tuesday saying the effort was illegal.

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, to discuss a possible curfew
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who will be off the road to showcase their most satisfying boxing match in the near future for a 147-pound six, met each other for the first time on Thursday.
Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, was in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until he walked the corridor and greeted World Boxing Organization super-ride-coin champion Lomachenko.
With a voting union at Showtime on Friday, the former world champion in four coins, Adrien Broner, is among the top five members of the list who, after Garcia's defeat, have not been followed by a coin.
Garcia extended his right hand and said: "How's it going, the champion?
Good luck to you. "
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN at 7 p.m. on Saturday night.
As the two posed for photos, Lomochenko's manager, Egis Klimar, notified that a potential curfew between the beat would be "the perfect size."
"I'm an old ribbon coin," Garcia recalled.
"I've been on the rise (140 pot) for the Broner, but I'm not that big," he said.
I'm downstairs for 140.
I want to get down to the light coin.
He should go through the light coin (135 pounds), then we can get beat.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them that. "
Lomachenko attended.
"Boxing needs this beat," he said.
Klimas asked if it should be in 'grime and watch'; it's part of his strategy to arrange a date for a groundbreaking summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 transplants) and to beat Lomachenko in a 135-pound-for-pound opening match later this year, while Garcia was on September 23.
"The dress' may be on the outer and watch because all the fans want it," Garcia said, adding that he was open to it whichever channel offers the best financial package.
We are the main names.
No other name creates that degree of interest.
Whenever they are ready... "
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as a "tremendous beat" and could take part in Saturday's match.
But Lomachenko hesitated in tweeting praise for Garcia that cut plenty, and said he thought the three coin champions from Riverside looked "very slow," adding: "Look at the knife, Mikey... ask you for the transplant."
Garcia said the foot was boxing after showing off his eye-popping power first.
Both said they felt the momentum was created for their own encounter.
"This is a beating that has to be done.
Another beating doesn't create that much attention and speculation.
"I'm very happy to deal with that," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I waited for the best beat and that's Mikey.
It's going to be a great beating. "

The White House does not plan to impose sanctions that would affect Moscow's pipeline construction, but sanctions against Russia could push up the cost of those lines.

New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment test have been released
The most recent results of assessment tests by refugees, subject to a new method of medical age assessment in Sweden, have ruled that more than 80 per cent of those surveyed are older than 18 years old, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these tests.
Sweden's national Office of Forensic Medicine and Disease (Resttsmedicinalverket) started doing the tests earlier this year.
The tests are designed to make age assessment more accurate in the asylum process after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for its failures in assessing the right ages of some refugees who claim they are not restrained.
So far, Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases to the test, and the Department of Forensic Medicine and Medicine has now announced the outcome of a total of 2481 from the period from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
In 25 cases, the Office of Legal Medicine and Medicine ruled that the experiment was "probably 18 and above."
In 432 cases, the result was that the person was "probably under 18."
The tests were conducted only in cases where the person's age is suspicious.
The results are consistent with past months, according to Johan Goransson of the Office of Legal Medicine and Disease.
"We don't see a big difference in statistics compared to past months, the numbers are pretty consistent," he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases deemed to be older than 18 does not mean that refugees are hugely lying about their age.
In May, the agency announced the outcome of 581 deliveries and said there were 442 cases where "people surveyed were shown to be 18 years old or older."
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of the 581 reported cases, it found that 243 cases clearly declared that she had turned 18 this year.
The medical age assessment method, which involves attracting a rollercoaster of 20-year-olds and doing an MRI screening of diet screens, then analysing them to teeth and radiologists, has been criticised in some circles.
One of the Kushners is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, who assesses the biological maturity of people who also have work on whether the age of bullying is sooner or later than usual.
"I have reasons to think about it, and I think that's not the kind of measurement used.
It's very suspicious to decide the biological age in this way.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't do it as it is, "he told the Metro newspaper.
But Goransson, of the Office of Forensic and Medicine, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you might say the risk of a child being ruled incorrectly that he was an adult is small.
The biggest risk is that a person is just under the age of 18, and in this case the risk is around 10 per cent, "he said.
However, when the Turkish government said it was committed to launching the dam at the time it was scheduled, archaeologists launched a large-scale effort to save items found in the area before it was flooded.

Star Hamidian Mosque opens to worship today

Olympic third, Turkey receiver.
He was born in Cuba, but his own volcano documented Turkey when he arrived for the F.B.
He became a Turkish citizen in 2013 and played for the national team....
He became European champion first, then the Olympic third...
Now he is one of Turkey's top medal prospects at the World Athletics Championships.
Yasmani Capello, who competed in the 400m hurdles, spoke to SABAH ahead of the championship, which begins today.

Develop the coaching passion.
Then they called it, but this time, you didn't go.
Some of them think the squad chose Turkey for money.
What do you say?
The last thing I remember about Cuba was my departure from the national team.
From that moment on, I can say, I drew a line to the events I had, what I had.
And then I came to Turkey at the invitation of the Fenerbahce club.
The attempt at the Team was also thanks to Fenerbahce.
They offered me an offer for reinforcements.
I opened a new chapter with Turkey.
I had a lot of injuries in my youth but had significant success in Rio and Amsterdam after the opportunities presented to me in Turkey.
I'm looking forward to doing the best at the World Athletics Championships and winning a different title.
Screaming at the press conference recently.
Do you understand the cause to us?
Whenever a question is raised about Turkey having me; in my mind, my childhood comes, at the age of 23, to be thrown out of the Cuban National Team.
And, of course, people in Turkey have an approach to me.
When I won a gold medal at the European Championships in Amsterdam, I felt things like that when the Confederacy was knocked out.
I couldn't keep my tears.
I am also very grateful to Turkey for giving me the opportunity to realise my dreams.
I am so happy that I belong to the Turkish National Team.
I'll be here until my legs run.
You've said before that he might be a Turkish lover.
Right now, you're with a Turkish, you went to Cuba together.
Want to share what they've been through?
Calamity is the biggest increase in being with a Turkish...
When I compare it to Cuban women, peace...
Turkish girls have their relationships.
The girlfriend is also an assistant coach.
You are together all day, for example, involved in feeding?
He's been eating more sweets than me.
 (Both laugh) I don't actually have a very tight diet, but occasionally gets involved in what I eat.
My coach, Massimo Matrone, also often makes tough warnings with my diet, but I know that these are for my well-being.
How about looking out for Turkish food, does the loved one eat for you?
Turkish women do a lot of good food, but my loved one makes it better.
 (Laughs) Kuru fashion-pilgrimage is the first choice.
I laughed at him SADECE
My coach in Cuba didn't believe me.
He got other young people to my place.
We met in Cuba after winning medals on behalf of Turkey.
Looking at my face, he showed me to the young athletes next door and said: "Look, that's it, I raised him."
I just laughed at him.
My observation is BENIM nervous
Wonder of the observation you wear at the races...
I just use it for concentration.
As soon as I wear the glasses, I cut off my relationship with the world and dug in on both sides.
I'm just focusing on the finish line and I don't see anything else.
What's the first thing on his mind when we say Tokyo ICIN HEYECANLI Tokyo 2020?

CoE praises Russia's' sincere 'apology for doping scandal
Sebastian CoE, the boss of global athletics, praised Russia's apology, which he described as sincere, referring to the doping scandal, but insisted the time was not right for the country to be re-admitted to the sport.
Russia's athletics boss Dmitry Shylakhtin told the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that it was right for his country to be banned from the sport and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he had apologised to "all athletes whose gold and silver medals in competitions were forced out of them."
Despite his assessments, the IAAF Congress voted to continue the ban in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think today is a very sincere response, a very sincere presentation," the head of the IAAF told CoE reporters.
"The whole council and all the congressmen were satisfied... that the Russian Federation accepted him, that he had survived the very turbulent days and that he did everything possible to ensure the federation was restructured," he said.
CoE said Russia was also "pleased" that it had accepted the criteria for re-admission.
"I think it's a very constructive day, and I think the way has been taken, but Congress supports the suggestion that the task force is not the right time for Russia's rights to be returned," the CoE said.
"We must do everything to normalise this situation over the next few months.
Our roadside principle has always been to ask to separate clean athletes from the sluggish system, "he added.
Twenty-nine Russian athletes who meet strict IAAF criteria will be competing as neutral at the World Athletics Championships in London, which begins on Friday.
Rune Andersen, the head of the IAAF task force, said on Sunday that Russia had yet to meet a number of criteria for the return of its rights.
After a presentation to the IAAF Council in London, he told reporters that drug testing was still inadequate and banned coaches were still working freely.

TYDTA President Ermut: Foreign direct investment would be higher than last year
TYDTA President Arda Ermut said 55 per cent of all investment last year came after May.
"Maybe there would have been more increases, it hit the market," Ermut said, noting that there was no reduction in investment because of the July 15 FETIC coup attempt, but an increase to the contrary.
Maybe if these conditions were not created, if not some regional developments, we could see a further increase in the impact of the collision.
We are more hopeful for next year because of it.
Hopefully it will be a brighter year in terms of direct investment.
We are already going through the first five months, an 11 per cent increase from the first five months of last year.
But we don't find that enough.
"We're hoping there will be more," he wrote.
"It doesn't worry us, both global and regional developments," Ermut said, stressing that they are trying to diversify investors.
He tweeted that 75 per cent of direct investments normally come from Europe by 2010.
That number fell to 66 per cent.
Yet Asia's share rose from 2 per cent to 7-8 per cent.
Russia's share has increased.
As we tried to do that, the Gulf states had some problems of their own.
Turkey has good relations with all of them; in particular, Saudi Arabia and Qatar are two key actors.
But we are saddened by the problem between these two countries, and in its case, it allows investors to delay their decisions a little bit more.
We may be experiencing some delays, not only in terms of investments in Turkey, but because of that.
Arda Ermut tweeted that there had been some incidents over Germany last week, but the government, in particular President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has shown clear and precise representations of the situation.
When they talked about investors in countries where there has been the toughest political crisis, President Erdogan's retreat was, "Our problems would be between governments, and certainly not among peoples."
Second, these people have come and invested in my country.
They have no difference from Turkish companies for us.
On the contrary, they will come to us when they have the slightest problems, and we will solve it.
"We are certainly not going to let them become victims," Ermut said, adding that they continue to support all investors with the relief of it.
"We can give the assurance of that in the next period," he said.
You will see that neither German companies, nor investors from countries where we have had some problems in any way politically, will have a shortage.
On the contrary, hopefully, we will do all we can to increase investment from these countries as well.
We think investment from here will continue to rise.
Of course, political developments can sometimes affect perceptions of the investment climate.
"But we are going to do our part at this point and do our best with the goal that our investors, as well as the perception of the investment environment, are not affected," he said.
After a one-generation one-way strategy, Turkey is starting to get a lot of interest from China, but if problems in the Gulf are resolved, they expect the biggest investment from the Gulf, TYDTA President Ermut explained.
"In relations with Germany, there is not even one investor who said, 'We've been in trouble because of these relationships, we had investments because of this incident, we're running away,'" Ermut said, noting that there are companies that are coming, coming and following.
"Currently, up to 10 per cent of the projects in our portfolio are German companies," he said.
So the companies we've talked to from all over the world, almost 10 per cent are German companies.
Some of these are companies that already have investments in Turkey.
The man is going to grow his investment, or he has an issue, and he remains open as a project.
"So German companies are actually still an important part of our daily workflow," he added.
Stressing that all state institutions must be careful when perceived operations are taking place in Turkey, Ermut said the issue is sensitive and can be affected in the slightest of poor communication.
Ermut said what happened in the last two or three weeks was a good lesson.
The agenda of investors and politicians is always different.
We've always seen it; economic relations always allow political developments to sort of get in the way.
Germany will continue to remain an important commercial parent and a key investor.
Because it already has a lot of investments in Turkey.
The election agenda in Germany, unfortunately, adds to such rhetoric.
And when they go through, I think they are going to get a little bit more on the way.
In Saudi Arabia's feature, too, the two countries are careful not to make negative statements.
Ultimately, an investor investing in Turkey is investing, aiming at all the surrounding country markets.
So it's not because of Saudi Arabia, but because of the uncertainty in the region, there have been some slowing processes.
But we are still in talks with these investors.
My personal view is that investors are now waiting for a decision that maybe they can get faster.
'in a negative sense, I see uncertainty because of the crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia, I'm out of here, and we don't have Saudi investors.
On the contrary, we still have Saudi investors who continue to live in Turkey, while on holiday here, and at the same time talking to us, that we are following all their processes.
Arda Ermut tweeted that international direct investment (UDY) coming to Turkey last year was $12.3 billion, adding: "I think we're definitely going to pass it this year.
"But it will affect how far to go, these regional developments, global uncertainties," he said.
While he hopes the normally striking effect will be more, perhaps a little more limited, Ermut said in a statement, pointing out that there had been an 11 per cent increase from the first five months, which could be maintained: "Hopefully, if there is no bad development, I believe we will definitely close the end of the year like this or so, better than last year."
Ermut pointed out that a significant proportion of the attracted investments will continue to be real estate, and that new investments in logistics, health, fintech, IT, petro-chemistry, food, energy and manufacturing could be seen.
"We may soon have an investment announcements in terms of manufacturing," Ermut said, stressing that there will be new investments in which they will make their announcement in the coming months.
It's not a billion dollars, but it's a big investment.
"There could also be investments from intriguing countries," he said.

How will football's financial rules affect Neymar's departure to Paris?
Rules to prevent unlimited spending by European football clubs will not block Neymar's world record transfer from Barcelona, Spain to Paris-Saint Germain, France.
Any results could come from UEFA to Paris Saint-Germain, the governing body that oversees the European game, which has the power to mentor teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament.
The rules of the UEFA Financial Adil Games in 2011 mean PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar is funding his transfer without huge losses.
Barcelona were paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of its contraception, and Neymar will rule on a salary that would total tens of millions of dollars a year.
Some financial aspects of Neymar's departure to France:
Given the team's money from the energy-rich Qatari family, PSG could, of course, pay the money to sign Neymar and add him to the galaxy of other stars.
Clubs are allowed to spend loads of money to buy players, but they also have to balance it with legitimate income resources, provided they can cope with their work on football.
The FFP was designed by Michel Platini, after he was elected as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed clubs with big debts in pursuit of success were actively fraud and, if banks or owners withdrew their support, he was at risk of bankruptcy.
In 2011, the FFP began tracking its losses rather than concentrating on the debts of the clubs.
The change meant that the model that Roman Abramovich first used in 2003 at Chelsea (a club al with potential, high spending walks and a global brand to improve the team) turned into a more difficult venture.
During the three-year FFP assessment period, which runs through 2018, clubs can suffer losses of £30m.
Although Platini was discreetly removed from the presidency in 2015, his successor at UEFA, Aleksander Ceferin, is still determined to give up overspending.
Andrea Traverso, who runs the FFP at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week: "The FFP has certainly not died and we will hopefully strengthen the rules by moving forward."
If anything, PSG will collectively pay Neymar's purchase clause, but it could spread the expense to the contraceptive suite for accounting reasons.
Neymar signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee could be cited as a cost of £44.4 million in annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave in 2014 saw the introduction of the heaviest currents to Manchester City, which PSG and Abu Dabi owned.
PSG were fined €60m ($82 million for then), which was later reduced to £20m, and ordered to limit their Champions League squad to 21 players instead of normally 25 for the 2014-2015 season.
UEFA is in jeopardy against clubs who may try to deceive financial regulators by inflating their income through companies linked to the club's owners.
A Qatari company can sponsor PSG, but if it is thought that the value of the sponsorship exceeds standard market values, UEFA will not allow it to be counted as a rightful income.
That was the case when UEFA ruled in 2014 that the Qatar Tourism Authority's PSG sponsorship was inflated.
Part of Neymar's earnings from PSG could reportedly come through payments from Qatar's 2022 World Cup organising committee.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar would be an ambassador for the World Cup, and such a move could easily be revealed by UEFA regulators.
The sanctions against PSG in the past mean UEFA will be even more careful against experiments to circumvent the rules.
UEFA is not in a pre-emptive meeting with PSG over Neymar's transfer, according to what those who have been involved in the matter said on Tuesday.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about PSG's situation.
Recent published accounts show that PSG made a profit of more than 10m euros in 2015-16, with 542.4m euros in equipment.
Accounts for last financial year have yet to be published.
PSG expect Neymar's arrival will contribute to sponsorship deals, souvenirs and format sales.
The club expects turnover to increase by at least 30 per cent after it is signed.
Clearly irritated by the departure of one of football's greatest players, the Spanish league has tried to block Neymar's departure from PSG's alleged breach of the FFP.
La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS: "This is a clear case of 'financial doping' with his club and state," referring to Qatar being the exact owner of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose own club is owned by an American sports giant, shares his concerns about La Liga being funded by a state.
"This is a result of having, and it has completely changed the whole range of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"When a country has a club once, anything is possible," he said.
It makes it very difficult to respect the Financial Fair Play because for a country, it can lead to different methods or different areas of interest for such a great player to represent a country.

Significant 'ceiling price' islanders
The insurance industry has been hurt in the traffic bracket since 2006, according to TSB data.
The sector lost £2.35 billion in 2015 and made just £19m of profits in 2016.
The stock is trading at Akinsurance, Anatolia Insurance and Sun Insurance in Istanbul.
Speaking at a meeting assessing the TSB's first six months of results for 2017, Councillor said 11 years of damage to traffic insurance had reached £7.3 billion, with a ceiling premium practice forecasting the industry's losses to £2.3 billion this year and an estimated hard-to-premium rate to 12 per cent.
This year, the 2015 figure will be captured, he said, noting that the damage written in 2012 and 2015 also took the profits of other brackets, "which means that by funding the bad driver, we are also increasing the price of the resident's housing policy."
"75 per cent of the industry is foreign, and our partners abroad, in some ways, have funded bad driving," he said.
"It's crazy," Countess said.
We don't have an expectation of profit from traffic, but as we look at the past 11 years, we can't show that we've made any year of profit.
"We accept that as well, but we also remain hopeful that we can carry that damage in a reasonable environment, along with other policyholders," he said.
There were dramatic price rises when the damage to traffic took the scarcity of other products, he said: "There were around 30 per cent price increases in traffic signage in 2012, it became almost double in 2015, we wrote about the biggest loss in our history."
"Even in an environment where prices have increased so much, our traffic profits were just £19m at the end of 2016," he said.
"We will lower the price of good driving on a free tariff and impose a high price on bad driving," he said, adding that he expects the free tariff to be passed next year.
"However, the Treasury is looking at the overall trend, and the final word on when it will be in the Treasury," he said.
The Treasury said the rise in mandatory car insurance premiums from 2015 had affected a wide range of the community, introducing a maximum premium (ceiling price) from April 12.
By contrast, each group of vehicles for mandatory traffic insurance policyholders has set maximum premiums for mandatory traffic insurance on the basis of designated city groups, with printing and traffic congestion and accident statistics.
Meanwhile, as of July, the "Highway of Risky magnets" practice was implemented for damage frequency high footprint or vehicle groups in mandatory traffic signage.
Premiums and damage to car insurance policy under the pool will be split among insurance companies.
The premium for these magnets will be identified by the Treasury Department.
With the ceiling premium applied, traffic saw premium production fall by 11.5 per cent in the first six months of 2017 compared with the same period a year earlier, while the number of policyholders rose 4.9 per cent to 8.6 million, while the reduction in traffic policyholders reached about 30 per cent, given inflation.
"With these ceiling prices, this loss is unsustainable," he said, adding that traffic will still take profits in other brackets this year.
How much longer can the industry bear the damage? "He said.
The capital of all companies in the sector is £9 billion, the industry's capital would have been finished in three years when only £2.3 billion was damaged by traffic, Councils said, looking at 'What good driver is funding bad driving, why are my thousands of shareholders funding bad driving in Turkey?'
"At this point, we're trying to explain our lesson to the Treasury," he said.
Asked whether foreigners had come to the point of reducing weight in the Turkish insurance sector following these developments, Caglays said: "They still haven't reached that point."
They expect to invest more in Turkey because the Netherlands has an average of 6 policyholders per capita, compared with 1.3 in Turkey.
"So Turkey is a place that needs to be truly magnificent," he said.
So they have not given up here.
However, although the company makes a reasonable profitability each year, it leaves all profits in the bungalow and uses it for the company's growth.
Premium output in the sector in 2016 was £40.5 billion, compared with £23.1 billion in the first half of this year, up 12 per cent from the same period last year, according to TSB data.
Councillor said it estimated the industry would not finish the year with 15 per cent growth in total premium production.

Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his waiver.
There is also another fabulously cruel plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who has now been decapitated by George H. W. Bush (a taxpayer very well situated by Michael Ian Blatter).
As usual, the best part of the series is the occasional words.
It's very pleasing to see the always young Mr. Rudd, who has Matt Dillon's dusty underwear beard in "Beks," in particular, that his, Andy, the former school's most popular boy, now seems like a moron.
There may be random hole moments that give power to this series (for example, the series "Seven Up!," which is kind of repeating), so until I reach what I think is the logical result: "The American Way of Issue: Twenty Years," so it's a friendly description of the final film "Issue" to see.
Meanwhile, the "Road Debate" on Amazon speaks to a different kind of nostalgia: The Cold War resurgence of "The Americans," the film "Bomba of Sargent" and even "GLOW," with its iconography against Eastern, Western wrestling.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, the comedy, directed by Rhys Thomas, looks like the TV found: A 1980s Romanian police drama in which two Buddhist police officers fought for real, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist road.

There are some pleasant visual comics (as Americans watch football, officers spend time watching chefs on TV) 
The famous vocal artist cast, too, among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny; "sound is a good material for the bitch" game.
But "Road Debate" is so devoted to the fact that a bearded propaganda drama is embedded in reality (including a killer wearing a Reagan mask), it often plays exactly like it.
He doesn't know how to go through six long episodes and comedy isn't quick enough or often enough.
As Gregor and Iosef controversially visited the American embassy, where there are two bottled men in the lobby who always eat a wild rainbow like a hungry wolf, the "road detective" could have better fulfilled the propaganda satire if shortened to a narrower length.
His message to the fictional communist viewer is that Western culture can translate into eating that will defeat anything serenely.
The fictional Romanian creators weren't unfair: We are doing this to our own recent past, and even to them.

FETIC "s horse, Kadyannás
The British Government has seen our family suffer and sacrifice as a result of fifty years of experience.
The government's youthful authorities have acknowledged that this family has been intimately committed to the British Government since the outreach and has done great services.
It is loud for the British Government to be smart and careful about this fixture it planted with its own hands, to thoroughly investigate and examine everything and decide carefully.
As we try to understand FETIC, the organization of the Hashhawks is dealt with as a starting point, but an elusive difference that has been forgotten is that FETIC is an organization that emerges in the emperor era and acts with colonial satellites.
The 'pioneering movement' that needs to be dealt with in this miniseries is candidly Cabinet.
In British praise at the entrance, the man who describes himself as' the fireman planted by the hands of the British Government 'is the founder of the Cabinet, Mirza Gulham Ahmet Kadiyanni.
"On December 1, 1888, he reported that God ordered him to take a bite from his fans and create a separate community," said Gulham Ahmed, a native of Cabinet, a small town in Pencap, India.
Gulham Ahmed went a little further, in 1891, when, according to the validity and medication he received, Marsh b. Meryl, like other neutrals, died of a death of course, that God sent him to messaging and Mehdya, where Christians and Muslims were waiting.
By contrast, with the messaging that Muslims expect, Mehdali is the same person, and that is the Mirza Gulham Ahmed Caucasian.
 (Isis Encyclopedia, TDV) 
In India, which came under purely British homosexuality after the 1857 Sipahi uprising, Gulham Ahmed, who wrote books defending persecuted Muslims against Hindu and Christianity, is thought to have been founded entirely with cardinal satellites, but the CIA support was later revealed by the Communism.
Like the same Gulen, Gulham Ahmed's favorite idea by emperors is that "jihad" is a struggle that Muslims only do with their own breath, and that there is no dimension of empowerment to fight if you can live their religion freely.
Indeed, if you remember, Gulen went a step further, praising even attacks by Hearts, whose wound in our history is still open, in a 'vault' last year: "It is not too dangerous for Hearts to occupy your country.
Because there are red lines between you and them.
Once, they don't relate to your woman, your daughter.
They're not mainstream, they're uninspiring Hearts!
The idea that Mehdi and his memoir were united in themselves, that his own community would be the saviour of Isis, aside from the similarity of the stances with FETIC, as the concept of jihadism only means fighting hate, the way the Cabinet spread has generally taken place in the field of education and civil society.
The total number of adolescents in the world, said to have exceeded 2 million, is 1869, and the number of countries officially registered by the emergency charity "Humanity First" is 23.
In addition, there are 36 hospitals in 12 countries, 650 dispatchers in 55 countries, 8 mattresses in Africa alone; 505 educational institutions in 11 countries; and about 16,000 mosques around the world.
Given that the Nobel laureate's "first Muslim scholar," Professor Abdusselam, is Sir Zaferullah Han, who served as president of the United Nations Court of Justice, and the Muslim actor "Mahershala Ali, who won the first Oscar award," we can see the depth of global powers.
Let's note that the Cabinet's meeting last week in the UK, with 30,000 people, was also shunned as a show of goodness.
A brief look at their history is enough to understand that one of their slogans, "love everyone, don't hate anybody," actually means "love your occupants / colonies."
It is possible to drive the exit point and motivations of controversies such as hulasa, FETIC or Tahir-ül Kadri to the Cabinet, and all of these organizations are actually backed up by a parade of empowerment and mainstream communities to serve colonialism.
Carpenter's "last ambition"

Two new projects by Ahmet Kul
Ahmet Kul Construction, which has so far implemented major projects such as Lavinya Park, Otoport, Vetro City, Ginza Lavinya Park, has put the DIA Mare in Istanbul Mimaroba and Solse 7 projects on sale in Bodrum Walker.

The project, whose nightmare structure is completely finished, will begin to be handed over to new owners in March 2018.

He transferred £753 million to affluent companies
Peace Walker said many programs were commissioned outside at TRT, which employs 6,760 staff, and fly prices were paid.
"In 2016, TRT again pegged the nation's taxes to AKP companies," he said.
"The name of this is robbery," he said.
The source cited by TRT to affidavit production companies has been revealed with data from official documents.
The official response to an application by CHP Istanbul MP Peace Yarkadah under the Freedom of Information Act showed how TRT's resources were spent.
On TRT, where 6,760 people work as staffers, Yarkah said that although there are all kinds of technical opportunities, a total of £753,500,000 was transferred to affluent companies in 2016 through programs commissioned under the external construction.
The CHP councillor said: "What this means is a hit."
"The production companies of AKP journalists and businesspeople are ramping up the TRT," he said.
"Millions are being paid for productions that are not monitored or whether they are pulled out," he said.
"The institution, which has 7,000 staff, has returned to the AKP's arsenal," Yarkadah said, recalling that the money cited by the companies was collected from the public's taxes.
"What programs have these companies signed up for, which 7,000 people couldn't do, and got that money?" He responded.
TRT's advertising revenue in 2016 was £224,456,182, Yarkah said, adding that when staff salaries and other costs are taken into account, advertising revenue remained a listing for the gig.
"TRT, which has become the voice of the AKP, is also unable to advertise because it is not being monitored," he said.
Feedback journalists receive money from TRT, stumbling on behalf of the AKP.
"The nation is suffering the burden," he added.
"TRT gives staff an annual salary of £660m; but it gives all things to foreign productions," he said.
Peers have been drawn from TRT - from the people's pockets to 753.5 trillion supporters.
This is dubious reasoning.

Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%
Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will not change soon after sluggish economic growth and moving inflation reduce speculation that there will be an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue "slowly" as they themselves hold interest rates steady, along with shrinking family incomes.
Decision-makers on the bank's Parasal Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25%; thus, fewer members sought an increase this month after slow economic growth weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank raised its growth forecasts to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that household incomes will continue to shrink as inflation is still expected to rise close to 3% in the spring.
But he signaled that interest rate rises were needed to rein in inflation fuelled by Brexit over the next few years, and said borrowing costs could have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw some of the huge economic healing package launched a year ago, in the wake of Brexit.
The bank said it expects it to offer more than $15 billion (a total of $115 billion) under the plan, which would end the Deferred Funding Plan, which offers cheap funding to banks from next September.
"The central estimate of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP), remains slow in the short term as the narrowing of household real incomes continues to be a burden to consumption," the bank said, minutes after the rate decision was made.
On rates, he stressed that "some contraction in monetary policy" may be necessary to ease inflation and would be "a piece higher" than the market expected.
Markets are still predicting the first increase will be in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank stresses that any increase would be "step by step" and "limited."
The bank's reduced growth forecasts this year and next compared with 1.9% and 1.7%, according to May's estimates.
The bank maintains its forecast of 1.8% in 2018.
Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro following the news.
The pound fell 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% to $1.11.
The decision not to change comes after the latest growth figures, which were disappointing as GDP was 0.2% in the three months leading up to 0.3% in the second quarter, dampened expectations of a plummeting increase.
Growth will probably remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but according to the bank, it will start to increase lightly towards the end of the year.
While the Bank says the recession will worsen before recovery, the most recent inflation report leaves little joy for households hit by rising inflation and spiralling pay rises.
The bank said monetary policy "cannot prevent" revenue being hit over the next few years, but it expects wages to improve "significantly" towards the end of its three-year forecast.
Increased demand for UK goods as a result of the weak pound will support the economy, offsetting some of the reduced consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were slashed to 0.25% on last pound following the shock EU referendum vote, which took the pound down the head.
The bank estimates it will likely take four years for it to have an overall impact on prices and the economy.
Before the bank's most recent rate decision, there was a demand for a rising rate hike, with increased inflation pressure on households in difficulty and three policymakers calling for an increase in temperature to 0.5%.
Inflation fell from 2.9% in theirs to 2.6% last month, but the bank said it was expected and would rise once more in the coming months.
The bank said the vaccination was "purely" about powerless pounds, based on their 2% target.

NHS to write controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
In the High Court, patients will be able to access the 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment starting in September, after a battle over funding the drug on the NHS.
NHS England has announced that the pre-exposure profiling (PREP), a haul taken before sex, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk people by around 86 per cent, will be provided by health care to as many as 10,000 people estimated through a three-year preliminary experiment.
The High Court's ruling last year agreed to fund the experiment after the Court of Appeal upheld it - despite claims by the NHS to fund local authority - but was told it had the power to pay for the PREP.
The move, announced on Thursday, was hailed as a 'new and serious intervention' by Simon Stevens, the head of NHS England, with the National Aids Trust (nat) describing it as a 'turning point'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to record the public, and will have all been implemented across the UK until April 2018, with more clinics in the squad.
The pre-exposure profile (PREP) is a series of HIV drugs that reduce the risk of being infected with HIV before sex.
The experiments showed that PREP significantly reduced HIV transmission among those at risk of infection.
Getting a PREP before sex means a person has enough of the drugs to prevent HIV infection from settling in their body.
Such drugs can be taken every day, or until just two hours before having sex.
Those who are eligible for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transgender people and HIV-positive partygoers and those who can't be successfully treated.
The clinics will determine eligible participants who will settle for the experiment from men, women, transgender individuals and people whose parentage is not known to be controlled by an anti-retroviral treatment of their HIV status.
People living in the UK and enrolled in a practicing physician can also register for potential participation at participating local sexual health clinics.
The program will hold $10 million and NHS England has signed an agreement to provide the drugs this week with a bid auction.
The experiment was designed to assess the full potential of PREP, collecting clinical evidence on how PREP is targeted, conducted and applied on a large scale.
Mr Stevens said: 'This new and serious intervention will contribute to the vast and increasingly successful efforts in preventing HIV.
This is another milestone in three decades of development when it comes to subverting one of humanity's major health problems. '
Deborah Gold, the head of the nat (National Aids Trust), said: 'This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
If it is properly targeted to those in need and those at risk, PREP offers the possibility of transforming the HIV epidemic in the UK.
Starting in September, people at high risk of HIV, through this experiment funded by the NHS in the UK, will reach a new, powerful tool that is really specially controlled to the person and is not open to negotiating with a spouse; this will lead to the improvement of many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. '
Ian Green, chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'The priority now should be to ensure that the experiment is presented swiftly across the country and that no one at risk of HIV is left behind.
As the PREP experimental drug is now cleared, we are on the right path to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV. '
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow public health minister, said: 'We welcome the fact that the PREP experiment has begun and it has been late with months of delays and then the government's footing.
Evidence shows how transformative this drug can be in terminating the contamination of this infection, as part of our view of preventing HIV and changing lives
The experiment will take us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PREP altogether.
It is now important that this experiment is available as quickly as possible across the country to protect people exposed to HIV and bring us one step closer to finishing the spread of HIV in society.

Living the luxury life: Aspiring fold and smart design numbers have turned this little Earls Courts apartment into a ferocious house.
Former banker Joanne Leigh, a real estate treadmill pastor, went to shrink in 2014, moving from a vast house in Knightsbridge to the flat in Earls Court.
It's on the first floor of a screaming Queen Anne style tartan and proof of the new design that Joanne is convinced without collecting her luggage.
"Before that I was living in a much larger space in Knightsbridge with my former lover," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that coincided with my price.
The flat in Earl Court was shown to me and had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with him and made an offer that day. "
After the initial view, the 1,000ft apartment was refurbished from scratch.
Initially, it was a one-room and complex planned property; you had to go through the kitchen to reach the bedroom - and Joanne wanted to add a storage area and an assignment to take maximum advantage of the generous ceiling high.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows and a lot of light.
It was my condition, "she says.
For this purpose, he hired Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to benefit from the 12.5ft ceiling and create not just a structure but also a place for Joanne to live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two consecutive spaces, so the architectural challenge was to create an assortment of times that you could survive on the inside.
Erfan should have thought in a creative way to resolve the matter.
"The steel skeleton is quite complicated," she explains.
"We should have arranged the gaps so that they could walk away without needing to put down on each other.
It wasn't just about building a simple platform, but at the same time the steel would have been such a focus that they would have been on the right high based on the function at the top or bottom, "he said.
This arrangement also brought in a lot of additional drama, allowing Erfan to achieve two full-bodied rooms over each other.
For assignment, the old type of copper light window from Retrouvius looks at the magnificent living area below.
The bedazzled gold colour furniture, silver hats and the old type of Serge Mouille lights all set the style of the bill.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of the venue, space and light.
The mirrors placed at both ends of the short corridor make it look longer.
The mirror corner panel in the kitchen gives a sense of window to another room.
Antrede mirror units provide a storage space for Joanne's all-rounder blonde team and zombie.
The beauty of the sitting room, which creates a more magnificent perception of space, is to be able to cover the kitchen when not in use.
As soon as it opens, the kitchens are not new.
What is unique in that is that there is an upside-down door in the style of garage.
"We used some engineering in it," Erfan explains the skin MDF door, which was reinforced with steel.
"There is balance weight so when you push the door up, it really shifts easily," he said.
With the space and storage area used wisely, Joanne has won an additional 16 square feet, with an extra bedroom and an improved session plan.
"At the end of the day, it's what you're going to sell session space, or the value of your property is determined," said Erfan.
"As an employer will drink and make a calculation on the basis of the session area," he said.
There, they managed to use quality material that gave the space its luxurious look as it elevated ground space.
"The islanders are the objects you touch and thus help you build an emotional connection at home," Erfan says.
"At home, you don't fall in love with the power lines on the wall.
They are important, but do not tip the wings of your wallet. "
This is an illustration that, through good design and elevated meter, an agency can turn from a standard thing into something pretty amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you can choose not to leave.

Brothers fight for $500m property empire
The two boys are at war for one of Victoria's biggest property empire, valued at more than $500 million, forty years after the dynasty set up by Italian families.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who gave him to the High Court on how to share properties and business assets, at a property in Toorak.
Paul had wanted to get out of the family business since 2014, but there was fierce debate in the High Court over the breakup.
Brothers Smith Street, along with their mother Anna, are the owners of 38 properties in Collingwood with a value of more than half a billion dollars accumulated since a shop in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and raised it to a zinc with 160 retail sales centers.
It sold for $85 million in 1999.
That money has been invested in the mill, and De Lutis's portfolio currently includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento builder sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller flats and shopping centres in the suburbs.
As part of a deal with their father, who has passed away, Colin (portrayed by Paul as "an important driving force and a dominant personality" in the De Lutis family) owns two-thirds of company assets and Paul a third.
A court filing says that means Colin has a mortgage worth $316 million and Paul $176 million.
For Paul, dividing the property and cash turns out to be a contentious issue.
In his first wild statement to the court in 2015, he wrote: "The divides proposed by Colin were leaving him with properties that I always refer to as the best of me."
Last Friday, the first High Court hearing was held after a number of failed mediation.
The boys are also fighting over who will control the current job; Paul claims Colin left him out of the job.
Colin argues that's not true, but accuses Paul of incompetent managing some properties.
In a heartfelt statement at the beginning, Colin says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian roots dictate to me that family is the top priority," she wrote.
Expenses in the case are on the rise, along with hundreds of pages of wild testimony, emails and the best lawyers, such as Allan Myers, QC, and senior legal consultants hired by both parties, which have been noted by firms including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer.
Female De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were an Italian immigrant family who ran groceries and singers from the late 1950s, and they bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They had taken Colin's property hostage to buy the Collingwood property, where the family opened their first coin pancake shop.
Colin says he set up Westco there "in my last years in high school, when Paul was a little boy (aged 10)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hope to leave their own property to their son in a friendly way.
"Luigi would often tell me that he never wanted the boys to fall on the court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies; as Colin said, when he quit the job, Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million.
Both Luke and Mark were "dissatisfied with the terms of their financial divisions," Paul said.
According to a 2015 biography of Eddi McGuire, the TV star's best friend, Colin tried not to draw attention, despite being a former AFL club board member.
He communicated with Fairfax Media, Colin and Paul De Lutis and his lawyers on Friday.
"I can't say anything about it," he replied, simply because Colin was in court for the case with a text message.
"It has been very sad that my brother Paul pretended to sue me and put our family's name in the courts," she wrote.
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote in a court application that he was trying to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father, Paul, and I wouldn't want us to fall into the current dispute," he said, adding that he was "still hopeful of a solution."
On Friday, that hope seemed lost.
"Our problem will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new private heir plans to restrict the president's media diet.
Others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do that.
If so, it would be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House special counsel will restrict the flow of information to President Trump (including news media reports), in hopes of keeping the boss more stable.
Some small information from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new special heir to the White House, met with senior staff on his first day at work, he summed up a fundamental problem that President Donald Trump plans to resolve about the White House: That bad information is in the president's hands.
Kelly explained to staff that the information should flow through him, whether on paper or through briefings, because the president would have been able to make better decisions when good information was given.
Kelly's description makes a lot of sense, but others have tried and failed to impress Trump by overseeing the media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and he's now in the White House, and the TV watchdog is still in good shape.
"If Agent Trump was sorry for not being fairly involved in the media, the yield was heightened to show him that he had a fair place in persuasive media outlets," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
"According to the Six campaign official, the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control was to ensure that his personal media consumption included a steady flow of praise," Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time.
I can't.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit is "under control" at any time is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officers know something that the rest of us don't know, for example, that Trump's tweets will be far more inflammatory, if not their interventions themselves.
We'll probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his recruits were able to get him out of danger, even a few times, then his efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from repeatedly stirring controversy.
Part of the problem was that the White House was made up of hipsters competing with each other, or, in any case, people trying to advance their own agents with the material they presented to Trump (they could be trustworthy or untrustworthy) and their own world views.
Politico reported in May, throughout this whole story, that advisers tend to strategically convey skeptical information to the president.
One example detailed by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officers say Trump has reacted hysterically to negative Cups from the press, especially leaks that have a bad impact, and he has trapped himself to find out where they are motivated," he said.
That was at the end of February when someone falsely gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of the internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing the deputy special counsel, Katie Walsh, of being "the source behind a series of leaks" in the White House.
It was of no significance that Johnson was basically banned from Twitter for harassment, or that he did not offer any concrete evidence, or that he had leveled drunken accusations in the past, and that he had returned from them.
Trump read the article and began asking the staff questions about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that the then special counsel, Reince Priebus, and White House staff secretary Rob Porter, were "trying to install a system that manages and certifies documents that Trump received."
How did that result?
Three months later, Kelly is trying to do the same thing.
Perhaps he will emerge as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still in his own driveway and his aides are still competing for influence.
These variable factors will make Kelly's job quite difficult.

Crypto FETIC "reveals" with special shampoo
Izmir State Attorney Berkant Karakaya concluded the investigation after he said the undercover witness, codenamed "Sargent" as part of an investigation into irregularities in the "military spy investigation" and the leaking of some information, was the head of the Marine Corps Command's Personnel, the Confederacy. "
The review highlighted that, contrary to the fact that the Confederate Publisher was not a member of the organization, he helped the inquiry in defiance of members of the crippling organization in the Marine Corps Command and played an active role in the fight against FETIC.
The judgment, which pointed out that Yayci was meant to be ordered and pasted by the Marine Corps Command under a so-called tightening order in a coup attempt on July 15, underscored that Yayci had fought effectively against FETIC from the first day of the coup attempt.
The injunction, issued by Charlottesville, read: "Republicans have agreed on the detection of crypto Marine Corps Command personnel, thanks to a special system created across 209 sub-cryptocurrencies with special scams and 64 basic criteria for detecting FETO members from the crypto privacy services class."
As a result of his fight to the contrary, such as the observation of a specialized and intrusive effort in criminal investigations, the confidential witness's affidavit, and the fact that there is no evidence against him, which is not based on a foundation, he is known to be an active terrorist organization, and an assessment based on his calculation.
He was previously charged with insult.
Behind that, it turned out that there were still FETOs and the alleged offence was a knife.
Former Air Pilot Staff Colonel Hakan Dinc, who was slammed by Yayci for insulting him, is a former Adana Investigation 10 who turned the complaint, which was only in the form of an information note, into the document.
Tanker Us Commander Air Pilot Brigadier General Bakir Ercan Van, former Chief of Staff Superintendent Colonel Muharrem Conway, who authorized an investigation, and former Chief of Staff Officer Mustafa Ozsoy, former Chief of Staff Superintendent Major General Erkan Akin, who authorised the prosecution.
Some members of the organization, including Tuncay Opchin, a FETIC consultant, appeared to target Republicans for their conversations on social media before and after the coup attempt on July 15.
Travelers cross envelope, return to 'wealthy neighborhood
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are back in a fight with decapitated travelers who cross the enclave excavated by the council to reclaim space outside their own property.
Travelers parked their 20 caravans out of an area that had a street in place of Solihull's version and was referred to as a 'neighborhood of the rich'.
They returned after just being chased in May by bringing horses, babies and a slew of freight cars, undeterred by the envelope that the council had excavated to cut their flows.
The ardent moving group found a gap in defence, leaking drinks by arranging a road from a section that left their vehicles without roadblocks.
Angry residents criticized Solihull Council for the comparison, saying it was' unhelpful in solving the problem. '
An anonymous caller said: "They arrived there on Monday evening after being sent from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passersby.
The council should be ashamed of their actions because they are not helpful in solving the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they had been sent off and now they are back again.
There was more to come tonight, and probably even more to come today. "
He added: 'Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it with the long distance decisions taken to protect its parks.
I live on the street of Streetsbrook and I'm not happy to keep paying my tax while the council can't even stop it. '
One area resident, who did not wish to be named, said: 'It's like a joke, we saw the last group of travelers leaving yet so we were immediately ruined by a new group.
Their numbers had increased this time and a horse was even seen driving in the parking space. '
A female spokesman for Solihull Council said: 'We are aware that there is an unauthorised camp on Streetsbrook Street land, we are launching the legal procedures necessary to send them out there as soon as possible.
To support our gathering of evidence, it is very important that as many area residents as we can call 101 to report any anti-social or cryptic behaviour to the police.
This will help in revealing a picture of the situation for the court to take into account when we present our case to the court. '

Italy toughens NGOs' approach to migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs that operate migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean that if they fail to comply with new rules affecting their operations, they will not be allowed to continue.
"If NGOs do not comply with the new charter, it will be hard to see them continue to operate," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Torino newspaper La Stampa.
Minniti's warning comes a day after Italy's authority seized a boat operated by German charity Jugend Rettet on suspicion of actively collaborating with human traffickers, in a way that would facilitate unlawful immigration.
The charity, which has only been active for a year, refused to comment on the contents of the elaborate imagery brought against them by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
In a statement on social media, the agency said: "For us, saving human life is our top priority, and it will be, so we are very sorry that we will not be able to work in the search and rescue zone right now."
"We can only make an assessment of the charges that are being made now, once we gather all the information and are able to assess the situation," he said.
Italian officials had been monitoring Jugend Rettet's boat, Iuventa, since October.
The crew are suspected of taking the rubber boats packed migrant, who was handed them straight away by human traffickers, on a boat and allowing smugglers to flee by boats, for use again.
At least one such meeting took place at 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's files, whose contents were published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of undermining the authority of the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the area due to humanitarian efforts rather than any other purpose.
Under the charter, boats like Iuventa were supposed to be an Italian police officer who was clearly observing their activity on the deck.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in the search and rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the charter: Save The Children, Malta's MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The last of them said on Tuesday that it was evaluating the new rules were unnecessary but acceptable because they would not cause any "serious changes or obstacles" to its own rescue operations.
The Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF) is among those who refused to sign it.
Minniti, meanwhile, said the sharp drop in the number of migrants arriving in Italy following the saves last weeks was a sign that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local governors are bearing fruit.
She said: "In recent days, we've got to see the light at the end of the tunnel."
This month, he announced plans to hold further talks with Libyan governors about their economic development initiative and to take measures with Chad, Niger and Mali to reduce the number of migrants leaving them in hopes of reaching Europe.

Special commission at work
The panel will include CHP deputies Mehmet Gokdag, Cemal Okan Yuksel, Peacekeeper and High Disciplinary Board Chairman Turan Aydogan.
The commission said Berberoglu was arrested in Istanbul on October 4th.
His trial in the Oval Office will also follow applicants to the Supreme Court and the District Court of Appeal.
"The fact that the judiciary is independent and impartial, that it does not take orders from anywhere outside the law, is an indispensable condition of justice," CHP Secretary-General Kamil Okyay Sindir and Vice President Bulent Tezcan wrote in the post.
"Our MP, Mr Enis Berberoglu, did not demand any special status while serving as MP, did not seek refuge in the array of impunity recognized by his MP, and wanted to maintain his faith in the independence and impartiality of the judiciary," it said.
The trial process has been suggested that the court prefers to enforce political orders rather than make a judgment.
The article argued that the fact that a warrant had been issued before the conviction was finalized, despite the Supreme Court's rulings that misled lawmakers' arrests, was clear proof that the court had made a decision under the influence.
Michelle Carter sentenced over messages encouraging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through messages and phone conversations.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years as a legislator.
Carter was convicted in June, July 13, 2014, of the murder of Conrad Roy, who had burst into his own life.
Mr Roy's father said at a hearing on Thursday: "My family's heart is broken.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was allowed to remain free, on the way to the station.
He faces a maximum sentence of 20 years, but his legal team had argued that both he and Mr. Roy were suffering from mental illness.
Dressed in a red pantsuit and cream coloured blues, Carter was in shape with older eyes, his hands knitted and his eyes looked on the floor as he was sentenced.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
He ended his life to improve his own.
He did not accept responsibility, "she said.
"He never showed any remorse," she said.
But Carter's lawyer said: "It was horrible that he regretted it all."
But Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not see "any significant impact on the actions of his age, level of maturity, even mental illness."
A prosecutor read a statement from Mr. Roy's mother, Lynn Roy: "There's no day so I won't be mourning the loss of my beloved son.
I want her to be proud of me and how I have overcome everything, and I am trying to be with her sisters, with all the pain that we will carry forever, "she said.
Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that the authenticity that she could never attend her brother's wedding, or that she would never be able to still be to her children, was "out of her mind."
"The fact that that person I was with every day since I was born is no longer a pain that will always be with me for the rest of my life," he said.
The case appears to create intimacy, as there is no Massachusetts law that makes it a crime to tell a person to commit suicide.
When Mr. Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014, Carter was 17.
The case drew national attention when it revealed that Carter's text messages encouraged him to end his own life.
While on holiday with that family, the girl said in a number of messages she sent two weeks before her death: "There's a lot of ways to find herself, with a horse from a building, by stabbing himself, I don't know."
Moments before his suicide, he wrote: "You have to do this, Conrad" and "They're going to be free and happy to open the generator that you need to do."
Judge Moniz ordered that he should not be allowed to benefit from this case through the press, saying Carter wanted to attract attention through Mr Roy's death.
The case divided lawful views.
Among the minority who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was found guilty of murdering her Britannia room friend in Italy in 2007 before being discharged two years ago.
Female Knox (30) published an article in the Los Angeles Times that said in a contradictory opinion: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not imprisonment."

Mehmet Simsek's striking growth forecast
In his statement, he said inflation should come down to low single-digit figures in Turkey and said food inflation posed a "risk area."
He predicts inflation will fall below 7 per cent in 2018.
He said in his speech.
The next 12 months are critical in reducing uncertainties.
The biggest incentive is reducing uncertainties.
There is a strong government.
There is no political uncertainty.
I hope the uncertainties in our immediate geography also diminish.
By increasing our resistance to shocks with some reform, I believe we are putting Turkey on a growth trend of more than 5 per cent.
I said it months ago.
It's because the worst is behind us.
Slowly, it is no longer our energy into those areas, but to the reforms that will bring our energy to inclusive growth, job growth...
That's why the next 12 months are critical.
Reform, on the one hand, is already without political uncertainty, with uncertainties on the one hand.
Hopefully, our chances go wild, and the hardships in our immediate geography diminish.
Many of our classic markets have collapsed, even if we don't want to.
Libya, like Iraq.
We don't just lose Sunday, we're facing more than 3.5 million wave of immigration.
When we look at the past 15 years, Turkey has grown by 5.7 per cent, despite all these shocks.
Turkey, that is, we basically have sound problems.

Let me be clear, I'm from here, we have such a generous pension system.

Once in auto participation, the performance will be strong.
Why?
Because we took precautions.
Firms don't have to go and make an effort and massage.
By observing these concerns, taking into account the poor performance, we have made a flurry of how we will allocate global assets to which areas of investment.
In the deposit, you know, the yield is high.
Once, clearly, it will be a performance there, in addition to the 25 percent provided by the state.
The rest of the expedition is to treasure labels, and there is usually a low risk.
When we look at the big reception, I think interest will increase next time.
Because they will see the performance.
There is success, not a failure in the other area.
We restructured BES in 2013.
There are 6.8 million participants, and there is a backlog of £70 billion.

We want some more effort from firms.
They advertise a little bit, they tell you about this system.
We work in the jungle.
Maybe if we inspired him a little bit...
We'll look at it, we're working.
Maybe members of the public will see the introduction and see the accumulation and stay in the system.
Those out of the system are 38 per cent.
Almost half of those who leave are those with voluntary individual retirement.
You don't want two individual retirement accounts.
What do you do?
You're out of auto participation.
What's more, we were expecting a spike of around 10 per cent.
And there, I mean, we were very optimistic.
Once, the system works.
We brought a chill to the premier.
Insurance companies explain unilaterally sometimes.
They increased their premiums too fast.
When asked what happened, they said that judicial decisions do not take into account the current arrangements.
We've got new clear regulation.
And we said, do the need.
They said no, let's wait for the judiciary.
And we said, that would not be the case.
We have a split of opinion here.
Certainly, when this ceiling introduced a premium, some firms implanted.
We've got a new arrangement.
We created a pool of risky magnets.
Let me say, let me repeat.
I would prefer this system work through competition.
So I don't get these ceiling price practices right, they forced us to.
I would like to have a three-dimensional look at this event.
The system that we do is taken into account.
Two, if the system is functioning normally, it's a pricing on that pathway.
Her loads of inspiration are heavy, and almost £30- £31 of every £100 payout paid goes to tax DNC cuts.

Morning "headline saved his leg
Buerger's disease, which originated from the age of eternity, was a disturbance that used to be seen in men, but it is now common in women as well.
One of those women is Mehtap Dursun, 36.
His pain, which began two years ago, was chronicled in the footy base.
The hospital circulated when a young woman who was forced to walk was at risk of losing her leg.
A friend suggested Professor Youssef Kalko.
The headline in the morning showed the news: 'Azerbaijan saved the life of the Minister of Emergency Halls.'
Dursun then went to Kalko and appeared to struggle with Buerger's disease.
Professor Kalko took the young woman into emergency surgery.
Soon after, Dursun recovered from his pain and is now being treated for oxygen.
Audi to Modify 850,000 Dizel Arrests as car Manufacturers Ters face backlash
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer a software upgrade in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW board chairman said he believed the firm had "more smart options than driving limitations," referring to European cities, including Munich, where BMW is central (where it is considered banning or limiting diesel vehicles).
Daimler said on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the firms described the moves as a recall.
European car makers had heavily encouraged the use of diesel vehicles to help meet carbon dioxide emissions in Europe and the United States of America.
But the nasal oxides exposed by diesel engines are called cancer constructive and can lead to asthma.
The cost of the equipment that automakers must wear to neutralize the pit smoke laid out by diesel vehicles is also on the rise, making it difficult for the price of cars to remain competitive.
German car manufacturers are facing scrutiny, while Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has also been accused of slamming powerful car firms and ignoring the orders of the problem.
The firms are trying to avoid repeating the failures of Volkswagen, which concealed it was using the device, known as an infrared device, and adjusted emissions to comply with regulations when a car was being tested and loosened it in normal driving conditions.
Many Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, in Audi's engine development department, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, the former director, is an Italian and therefore not protected against the extradition of criminals and could be prosecuted in the United States of America.
Earlier this year, Audi was dragged into a German cross-examination, including Volkswagen; authoritarians expanded the United States-based inquiry after accusing Audi of installing a system to evade emissions rules in Europe.
Audi's inclusion in the investigation could be heavy on Volkswagen: The luxury car maker has an overwhelming share of Volkswagen's profits.
Fisherman jumping on every saw
Professor Yusuf Sukru Caglar, president of the Turkish Neurosurgery Association, warned of a lack of fisheries to shallow places, unsure of its depth.
Every year, thousands of people are at risk of paralysis due to painkillers and shoulder damage because of diving into shallow waters.
Painkillers most often develop in 5 or 6 "shoulders.
The characteristic of the fractures is that it affects the nerves that feed cows and leg taps at this level, as well as respiratory tape.
"The paint shoulder area, our costliest body in these types of accidents, is cut or squeezed by the shoulder, which is torn apart by a fracture, and is non-functional," Professor Councils said.
"The first aid in shoulder injuries can not only increase damage to the excavators but also lead to death," he said.
Fishing into the water is fourth in shoulder injuries.
The average age of those injured is 20-29 and the majority are men.
"Fishing should not be thrown into the unpredictable water," Professor Countess said.
"No matter how well he was drunk, there could be a severe injury," he said.
Professor Councils also recalled.
There may be paralysis in varying degrees in cows and legs, depending on the level of shoulder at the ground where there is damage that causes injuries while fishing drives.
You may know swimming but the water can be deceptive.
The place that seems to be deep into you can be shallow.
In the US and Australia, there has been a 70 per cent reduction in cases of fishing jumping into shallow water, thanks to warning leaflets placed on the sea coast.
"In Turkey, 28 provinces are flooded by sea, but unfortunately there is not even one warning sign in places outside Istanbul."
"There needs to be noticeable possession of information light or information panels on beaches and pools under every pre-summer county's health directorate, schools and social awareness project in relation to these types of accidents that are caring for life," he said.
Professor Kadir Kotil, president of the Turkish Neurosurgery Association Spinal and Periferic Cinema Surgery Group, suggested that in the event of injuries:
112 should be sought as the first job at the time of the incident.
The paint should be kept as steady as possible, not moved, and detected with a sharp catch.
The airway should be cleared and the patient must be positioned opposite side for the drainage of water fleeing into the lung.
It shouldn't be kept from the legs and switched off so it evaporates the water.
The shape disorder in the patient's neck should not be trying to fix it.
Paint shoulders may have been broken.
However, if the shoulder has not yet been damaged, an inappropriate position to be given to the neck during the first aid and patient's relocation could cause broken bone fragments to pressure the shoulder and cut and damage it.
He also said there was no reason to delay talks on fisheries and foreign policy, as the dispute over border traffic between Croatia and Slovenia has been resolved.
Serbian authorities are considering banning political groups that threaten others, officials said on Monday (September 22nd).

Journalist's murder underscores the growing threat in Mexico
Weekly newspaper Riodoce's staff usually meet on Wednesday to review the latest turmoil brought about by organized crime in the state of Sinaloa, its corrupt officers and plans for unfinished drug wars to be part of the paper.
But on this day, they came together to talk about their safety in the shadow of their own tragedy.
They were told that it was important for them to change their routine.
Two senior journalists discuss what makes them feel more secure: To bring their children to the office, the target of a handgun in 2009 with them, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words over the black throne in front of the room: Hardware, neutrality, allies.
They ask the Conservatives to suggest names for each suite; no conviction is needed, perceptions and inner voices are enough.
Journalists suspected of linking drug traffickers, politicians, business people, government or cartels to pay are the bad man who has made the job of writing a list doll Mexico's chaos in the newspaper dangerous.
There are no stakeholders in violence, there are more bodies across the country, and even more of them are journalists: According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 people since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and at least seven have died in seven counties so far this year.
Among the latest dead were editors and inspiration sources Riodoce founding partner Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez writes in one of his many books on narcotics violence.
His absence is deeply felt, but his presence is everywhere, with a large photograph of Valdez showing his middle finger hanging on the frontline of Riodoce's building with the words "Justice"; two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing his dress, and his shirt.
The study takes place two months before his death; reporters talk about their shared trauma, nightmares, sleep, and paranoia.
In 2010, a special federal prosecutor was created to deal with journalist cases, but according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, he prosecuted only two.
As with most of the thousands of killings linked to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, journalists' killers are rarely brought before the law.
In Riodoce; their hearts are broken, but they insist on addressing the violence in Sinaloa, even though the ground is now more deceptive.
Without information about the killers, without justice, it does very little to discuss security, "Ibarra said.
"It's very stupid to spend my time in this study," she said.
"As long as we don't know why, you don't trust anyone," he said.
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the provincial capital of Culiacan.
The red Toyota Corolla was only able to take a few blocks before it was stopped by two men; he was forced out of his vehicle and shot 12 times, presumably for the name of his newspaper, which translates as Once River.
The armed man got into his car and walked away and crashed the vehicle nearby.
Valdez was 50.
He stayed with his wife and two adult children.
In Culiacan, dementia tend to move around freely.
But when it comes to Valdez, virtually nothing but silence.
Last year, after Guzman's arrest and extradition to the United States in the oceans, Sinaloa was one of the country's bloodiest battlefields as rival groups fought to fill the void.
Empty the fact that one or many people are shot and killed every day on the street in Sinaloa, or that the cemetery's drug kings are decorated, two-storey, full of mosquitoes larger than many houses that are to live.
For a minute, forget the "calm" situation where only one cartel controls valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Despite this, and despite being aware of the depth of the dangers of Valdez's business, Riodoce's founding partner and director, Ismail Bojorquez (60), has been devastated by guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He believes the two hurricanes have contributed to the murder.
First, there was an interview with the leader of one of the rival cartel groups, Damaso Lopez, who was at war with Guzman's sons during a broadcast in September.
This article may have angered the sons; likely gang members have bought every nuance of the raid as soon as it is distributed to newspaper flags.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez, after the seizure of another paper containing the same story, to leave the country for his own safety.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing was seen as a turning point in the Mexican origin violence against journalists.
He had survived for too long, and friends and colleagues figured that he would always be there.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroeste in 2013 when he joined five of his colleagues by selling $50 worth of shares in the discovery of Riodoce.
"It was impossible to do journalism in Sinaloa without addressing the issue of narcotics," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the paper has gained a reputation for its bold and honest coverage, and advertisements have increased with the sale.
Reporters were delighted to publish live-streaming research without fear of censorship, and readers trapped themselves in a publication in which they were able to read stories that no one dared to communicate.
Eight years after it was founded, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for his reporting in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the Committee to Protect Journalists' International Press Freedom Award for showing the courage of the Mexican drug story not to pursue the beatings wherever the program is based.
He acknowledged that he was clearly afraid.
"I want to keep living," he said during the CPJ awards.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a "lifestyle," he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"As a journalist, you have to accept the duty that falls on you - or play this or stupid," he said.
"I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of so many deaths... why didn't you say what was going on?'," he told me.
Riodoce staff miss Valdez; his script that sounds like a hammer, his friends, who are generous in their cricket and teens, his teachers who know how to survive...
They relied on his routine.
He was always wearing his shirt.
He would go to the bar, El Guayabo, outside the office and he would always sit at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for his routines a collapse?
His death forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and survive.
"If you're hit with their women, their children, their clean business, the secret plane tracks they use to transport drugs, that doesn't seem to enjoy it," he said.
"These things were to cross the border," Bojorquez said.
The result was a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation, even at the best time.
Relying on their own instincts.
If bad smells are coming, it's far from it.
"The smell is a sentiment that can be picked up... and what happened to Javier," said Andres Villarreal, the editor of Riodoce.
He and others say the old rules do not apply in Sinaloa; the same Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and chartered smuggling routes, a toxic mix, as they do not apply in other counties that are home to weak institutions and corrupt government officials...
The ground is changing continuously.
No multiple mobile phones are allowed in the room where Riodoce staff meet for security training; days earlier, spy software sold only to governments appeared to have been used to keep an eye on journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers wanted to avoid a temperature of 104 degrees (40 centimeters), in the shade of a tree.
They have been assigned by the provincial government to protect Riodoce's office, which is located in a four-story building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Halfpenny is semi-serious, and some of the reporters wondered if these officers were from police within 50 percent who the governor himself said was not reliable.
Reporters have had months to go to the mountainous rural intersection, where drug gangs are effectively controlled.
In this week's edition, Riodoce explores three main stories.
The brother of former big boxer Julio Cesar Chavez had his murder in Sinaloa.
There was also the disclosure of government spending concentrated on the governor's homeland.
Then there was the kidnapping of a group in Culiacan's most expensive restaurant, a block away from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official explanation for who was kidnapped or how it was, so when it came time to write what everyone in the city knew, caution prevailed: The restaurant was the epitome of both drug traffickers and authority.
One reporter learned from official records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician from the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in the administration, who dominated almost all last century politics.
Many PRI governors have recently been accused of corruption in sensational incidents.
Villareal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at that scene, including the escape of one of "El Chapo" Guzman's sons in a military raid.
Just months ago, readers would look at Valdez's corner for information supplied by the best source on the abduction.
"We already knew what had happened before," said Villareal (46), nicknamed "El Flaco" because of its incredible structure.
"At the moment, all our communication channels with our resources have been cut off," he said.
Staff have turned into something they never expected, activists on behalf of the press, while Valdez's office is being reused as a warehouse for banners and stickers protesting journalist killings.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few banners and appeared on the show the next morning for another journalist at the local prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burnt body has been found and, according to DNA tests, official officers say it was him.
Journalists across the country have been more vocal in their thoughts, writing to sidewalks and buildings in organized protests to "help the Press."
Today, the director, Bojorquez, is trying to provide international support for justice in the case of Valdez, in Washington, far away.
At a meeting with the Sinaloa valet at the end of the day Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused the authority of spying on reporters and killing them for telling the truth.
After that, he asked to be appointed to a post other than to make government news, thinking his anger undermines his impartiality.
Valdez controversially said journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organised crime, criminal partner official officers and an unpopular community.
In his latest book, which he called "Narko-journalism," he wrote that journalists are being killed not only by drug gangs, but by orders from politicians and security forces that are cooperating with organized crime.
Media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of last year's attacks on journalists to police and official officers.
"You're going to die in Mexico because they would like to silence you," Ramirez said.
The killings have clearly had a cold shower effect.
No one forgets about the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note that was said to have been signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my reporting."
A computer ladder and glasses are strewn next to her severed head.
After Miroslava breach, a reporter in the northern border state of Chihuahua, was killed in March, some publications, such as El Norte, opted to close.
Others remain, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after his directors were killed in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed drug cartels with an editorial on its front page: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists fled their own counties, and even the country.
This is a solitary decision.
It's hard to find a job in exile and they're still scanning the streets waiting for danger.
Sometimes they are seized, as evidenced by the photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was murdered in an apartment in Mexico City with four women in 2015, three months after he fled Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue to work, it's a dance every day with these high-risk decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, says reporting the drug trade scares her.
"Mexico is going to hell and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on a recent past Friday, as preparations were made for the end of the final count, Riodoce editors sat on the sidewalk outside the office and drank beer, he began stealing phones at the same time.
A series of armed clashes involving rival gangs and security forces near Mazatlan, a resort on the beach, have led to 19 confirmed deaths.
The war was continuing to escalate, as promised in a series of cartel messages nearby.
Through their mobile phones on the sidewalk, they put the news on Riodoce's website.
The front page would have had to be replaced the next day.
The sirens started laughing nearby, and there is a conflict with another weapon nearby.
Bojorquez took a quick look at the police officers on guard to see if they were vigilant.
If they were afraid they didn't even show up.
Under a huge portrait of the newer founders of his papers, his middle finger was on display for all Sinaloa to see, Riodoce's staff was following his footsteps.
"How can you think of the shutdown," Bojorquez said, "on the day Javier was killed, when the interviewer asked me to send him out to report on the street?"
The dinosaur used camouflage to avoid his enemies.
At first glance, it looks like a statue, but to a terrible one.
Researchers have now revealed that the initial findings of an incredible creature in the size of germs found by a Canadian miner are very well preserved, with experts describing it as the 'Mona Lisa of dinosaurs'.
He was so well preserved that they were able to understand that his pad pad derriere was frail casual and said he had a 'troubled past'.
The report in the journal Curious Biology described it as' the best preserved armored dinosaur found and one of the best dinosaur spiders in the world '.
The fossil is a newly found species of noodles, having lived 112 million years ago in 110 million provinces from the middle of the Kretase Era.
Her exceptionally well-conserved condition stunned researchers, who described her as' really rude '.
Armour, eating plants, is the best confined fossil found in its own species, according to reports in National Geographic.
He was found by Shawn Funk while excavating the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in Northern Alberta Canada on March 21, 2011.
He hit something that seemed strange compared to the rocks around him and decided to take a closer look.
The discovered fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years exposing the wild animal from inside the 2500 pound (1100 kg) landslide.
After such an intense work, the completed result is now ready to be revealed.
Lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is displayed, said: 'If you cut your eyes a little bit, you might even believe it's almost sleeping.'
'as one of the most beautiful in the history of science and the best preserved dinosaur species, it will pass as the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs. '
By examining their journal, the researchers found that even though it was all covered in armor and a walking tank resembled, this plant food was probably facing a serious threat from dinosaurs eating meat.
The dinosaur, which is quite heavily armoured, used its red and white camouflage to hide from the wrists and used a protective technique, known as contra-shaming, used by many today's animals as well.
Experts say it is hung by larger dinosaurs, allowing it to better mix around them and survive their enemies.
The creature, which is from the nomadic family of 110 million, first made headlines in May and is currently on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers have now finished their work and called Borealopelta britchelli, the wild animal who worshipped to museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of the team that spent more than 7000 hours cruelly trying to figure it out.
The exceptionally preserved nature of the species made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and his team of international scientists to document the shape and the armour on the body with the delight of the pulses.
The animals discovered shadowing contraception, which is a common method of defense in the alley, which means the top of the creature is sheer by the lower.
Though contraceptive shaming is common, the findings are a surprise because Borealopelta's size far exceeds the contraceptive shadowy animals that are alive today.
This means that the dinosaur is sufficiently pressured and hung by dinosaurs eating meat, and evolution is enough to confront hiding as a way of survival.
But the most contemporary animals that use contraceptive shadows (for example, geese, zebrils or armadillos) are much smaller, and far more open to being an aunt; that means that no-one has faced a serious challenge to survive.
Brown said: 'Strong hunting for a huge, heavily armored animal shows how dangerous dinosaur walkers in Kretase can be.'
The chemical analysis of organic composition in their pulse also revealed that the lesson of the dinosaur was fraught casual.
To find out what she was eating at her last meal, scientists continue to study the animal for clues about her life, including preserved insect content.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was dragged into the sea, beside the backyard ocean surface there.
At the time, Alberta was as temperature as South Florida is today, and presumably the rivers and ocean had spread to content far more than they do now.
"Nodohard is really remarkable, with its completely pulled derriere covered and preserved, but also the fact that the original shape of the animal was preserved in a 3D way," Brown said.
'the result is that the animal looks almost the same today, no matter how it looks in early Kretase.
You don't need much imagination to rebuild it; if you cut your eyes a little bit, you might even believe it's almost sleeping. '
Kretase was when the giant theropods, the meat owl dinosaurs standing on two feet, traveled on Earth.
Though the king of them all, Tyrannosaurus Rex lived millions of years after the armoured dinosaur Borealopelta, who may have been hunted by a number of his exquisite horses.
Among them is Acrocanthosaurus, a monster at 38 ft (11.5m) long, weighing six tonnes.
The scientists, whose most recent findings are reported in the journal Curious Biology, believe Borealopelta was plunged into the sea after his death and candy in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk while excavating the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in Northern Alberta Canada on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, this is the best confined armoured dinosaur, including leather and armor, and is complete from neck to heel.
On average, the creature is around 18 ft. (Five metres) and weighs up to 300kg (130kg).
He has 2 20-inch long diamonds off his shoulders.
Researchers believe this armoured ot object circulated hanging in what is now Western Canada until it is dragged into the open sea by a flooded river.
But he has retained the dinosaur's undersea graveyard armour with excellent detail.
The fossilised remains of this particular species are so well preserved that leather pieces still cover tumbling armor layers along the dinosaur's head.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a conservation "is as naive as winning the lottery.
The more I look at him, the more incredible it is.
Fossilised leather pieces still cover tumbling armor layers, which feature a spot in the dinosaur's head.
Her right front leg extends next to her, and she has squared 5 fingers upward.

When I'm eating, don't be out of your teeth
Blunt teeth and an aesthetic smile are every person's dream.
As people resort to all sorts of ways to beef up their teeth, Nukhet Berk, president of the Oral Lazer Drugs Association, warns that they should stay away from products sold in the market or online.
It paints the surface of such substances sold, and the teeth are coloured so there will never be a recycling again, says Nukhet Berk, "the bathing of teeth can be supplied with chemicals practiced by dentists, or fine porcelain surfaces that make like a tap on the surface of the teeth."
Protecting dental health prevents many diseases from occurring, and aesthetic practices are important for mood health, with both dental and dental health and a nice laugh, Berk said.
As long as there is no disorder or genetic factors in dental structures, young people's teeth are usually free.
Teeth get sheer colour over the years due to aging, drawing dental minds and frequent consumption of cigarettes, vaccines or sheer coloured drinks.
Whitewashed teeth can be supplied with chemicals practiced by dentists, or with fine porcelain surfaces applied without minimal or no vaccination on the surface of the teeth, making them like takeaway chicken.
Teeth should never be whitewashed with products sold in the brand or online.
Because, these ingredients line the surface to its name, the teeth are coloured so it won't be recycled again.
The City of Keepers is giving elderly, disabled and bed-bound residents "Dental and Tree Health Service at Home" to this side from 2011.
"My wife has been informed of this service of the City of Keepers," said Corey Gunn, 65, who has lived a life in Keegan's Urban Challenge for 24 years.
We called the municipality, and they came anyway.
"I don't neglect my dental care if it's already paralysed down my neck, thanks to this service at all," he said.
"My mother has been addicted to bed for 7.5 years due to age," said Kezban Goff, a 72-year-old daughter of Gülizar Taskforce, 95, who lives in the Pink Challenge.
When I got to the municipality, I saw posters of this service and I called immediately.
We've been getting this service regularly for 4 years.
And I have a problem with my teeth, and when the doctors come in, they look at me as well.
"We're very pleased," he wrote.
There is also no requirement for any health guarantees for the service, which is completely free.
"Severance" incident in Turkish military
My lovely readers made very interesting decisions, especially for the Marine Corps, at a meeting of the Supreme Military Council (YAS) the day before.
This is not an Oramiral to the commander of the Force, but the Admiral has been brought in.
It is virtually unprecedented practice in our Army.
But how did that happen?
Force Commander Oramiral Bulent Bostanoglu filled his time, and he would have already retired....
And it happened.
Now the commander in chief had come to Veysel Conway, the only Oramiral.
Veysel Pasha, who has been a victim of knife in the past and has been imprisoned for some time, was supposed to be a commander in the regular communal rankings.
But the government didn't want him.
I try to explain a lot of summary, and if we start at the top in the Marine Corps, commanders at 1, 3, 4 and 5 were not promoted.
In this case, there has been one Oramiral left in the Marine Corps.
The vacuum machine had to be brought in: Navy Commander Oramiral Veysel Conway in number two.
But what happened afterwards?
Vice Admiral Adnan Ozbal, who is in sixth place, was appointed by the government.
Now you look at the picture now!
Oramiral Veysel Conway stands there, but instead a lower-ranking commander is appointed!
One senior is put in the order of the continent.
What happens next?
An Oramiral superior to rank does not serve in the order of a coroner who is inseparable from him, he can't.
He doesn't take orders from him, he can't get it.
In this case, Veysel Conway will not qualify for this incessant situation, if he is not retiring, he will step down today or tomorrow.
This is the resounding message that has already been given to him by the government: "Guy Veysel Pasha!"
News broke yesterday that he was stepping down in the afternoon when I wrote this article, but the situation had not yet been officially announced.
Now let's look back at those ones!
The government opposed Veysel Conway for one reason or another, did not want, forced him to resign, and instead gave the commander-in-chief a cornerstone in 6th place and undermined the traditional understanding of our military's "Citizen."
Although there is hugely politics within the business, we don't know the behind the scenes.
Maybe we can all learn if somebody understands it soon!
My lovely readers, I tried to tell you very briefly above, especially in the Turkish military, the communal event is very important.
Not just as a rank.
The officer who finished 10th in the Military School, for example, is more consequential than finishing 11th.
Promoted from first place to general, he is more consequential than when he was promoted in second place.
We've had concrete examples of this communal affair in Confederate Harbour.
Garp Front commander Ismet Pasha...
There are two armies in order.
The Army and the 2nd Army.
We arrived in 1922, and our armies will carry out great combat and chase down the Greek army.
At this stage, there are valuable names expected to be appointed as army commander.
One is Refet (Bele) Pasha.
He is offered an army command, but "the name is incomparable to me, I can't get to his order," he says.
Another name is Jakup Sheik (Superintendent) Pasha.
Ataturk's housekeeper at the Military Academy...
He is a precious and senior commander who has been involved in various wars, which he loved, valued, referred to as "Housewives."
In 1919, soldiers and civilians were captured along with Turkish intellectuals and released by the British to the island of Malta.
On his return home, he's reluctant about military command and says the same things: "The commander of the Western front is inseparable from me, I can't take orders from him."
Ataturk, however, persuaded him to ride and Jakup Sheki Pasha accepts the command of one of our two armies.
The third is a very colourful figure...
Ali Ihsan (Sabis) Pasha.
He's a very speaking, constantly criticizing soldier.
Iraq is a commander who fought in the Caucasus, Iran and on various fronts.
He's exiled to Malta by the British, running away from it and coming to Ankara via the Bay Area.
When he is offered an army commander, Ali Ihsan Pasha says the same things: "I can't fight in the order of Ismet, which is incomparable to me..."
But he is persuaded...
But see the bride, after her inauguration, continually debating with Garp Front commander Ismet Pasha, with whom she entered the order, making an affair and disgraceful the military...
And he is sacked and retired shortly before major combat, replaced by bearded Nurettin Pasha.
Afterward, Ali Ihsan never recovered from the pacifist's relationship with Ataturk.
The problem of severity in the Turkish military is not only in war, but also in peace.
Of course, he needs to come out.
Veysel Conway is the latest example.
How did an activist have to find out the answer to the question, "What are the streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was deeply shaken.
A day after arriving to travel to New York City, he sat on the bed of Airbnb, where St. Louis rented the landlord, and began traveling on Facebook on his phone.
It coincided with the sharing of someone from high school.
"The police killed an 18-year-old boy a little while ago and he is still in the street," he said.
He was surprised when he realised that no one else had shared the information in the content flow, shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user called @ TheePharoah takeaway was controversially retweeted in his flow of content.
The rap from the St. Louis area was literally tweeting about Michael Brown's death, at the age of 18, an unarmed black man was killed in Ferguson Missouri by a white police officer.
She shared a photograph of Brown's sexuality on the street, which was due to stay there for four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for her or her community.
He left his phone to return to tweets about people gathering later that evening on Canfield Drive.
There were police bangs, shouting people and photos of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, holding a banner reading "Ferguson police killed my unarmed son a little while ago!"
It was followed by a live broadcast in which a police officer stood with a Havan dog in front of a group of protesters.
In another video, another police officer, as he said, set up the theme of his rifle and shouted: "I'm going to kill all of you... animals."
Ferrell recalled saying, 'This is not used to it.'
'this is not the kind of murder that we're used to and it's typical of, 'he said.
I felt scared at the time.
I was crying and screaming. "
He departed a return ticket and went home the next day.
After landing at 11am, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided to go to Ferguson with her the next morning.
Ferrell and Ferguson will arrive in cinemas on August 11, what happens in the three years after that, the subject of a new documentary, "What's the Way?"
This is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, power and resistance from the point of view of people living in that community and filling the streets with answers they are looking for.
As Ferrell drove his vehicle to Ferguson with his daughter, who was wearing a flowing suit and wearing a tail fit for her, they went back to the conversation "about the experiences of the siblings and the status of the siblings" they had done several times before that morning.
"Remember I taught you that black people should fight for what they believe in?" He recalled.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old and that wasn't true.
I couldn't get him, "Ferrell said later.
"What happened here today... is a result of what has happened in the past.
He should know that, see it and grow up in that.
It should not only develop thoroughly in the field of activism and organizing, but also know the layers of the black experience and its black situation, and what we need to do to liberate ourselves.
If I'm lucky enough to give him an experience where he wouldn't personally experience nightmarish racism, it won't be a difference from any black women and children.
I get the feeling that by protecting him from them, I will be making him evil. "
When they arrived in Ferguson, their first stop was on South Florissant Road, where they waited to speak to officer Darren Wilson about the issue, which was in the face of the police center and resulted in no criminal charges later, turning into a sort of campsite for activists.
There, Ferrell and his daughter connected with local business owners preparing packaged food.
They prepared bags and helped bring them to the protesters.
A new flurry of activism was slowly shaping up for Ferrell.
"My eyesight was completely transformed after August 9," he said, indicating that he was president of the Association of Minority Students Hemisphere when he was a student at Missouri State University and concentrated on food justice and injustice in the black community.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It came on its own. "
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, at an evening screening.
Fogan said he and his own image, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, "wanted to document" what was going on.
Ferrell's mind was a question: "Do you want to document it or try to find a story you can use?"
This skepticism was reported by countless people, usually whites; to come to a community and benefit from his pain and resistance...
As Foyan explained in a recent interview: "We had heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson were not concentrated, and we decided to do it in a different way."
Fogan had already linked up with co-director Damon Davis, a regional artist known for his activism on prisoners who had received a death sentence.
His participation warmed Ferrell to the project, followed by six other regional locations, as well as the "Would Kim?" Team, in the years after Brown's shooting.
David said: "This documentary is not for someone to speak for us or speak to us; we are the ones who speak out."
"That was the main thing for me, it's how these people are going to be represented because that's how I'm going to be represented," he said.
"The aim is not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, but he proved to be the most obvious of the filmmakers, as he showed that the move was" not about a Messiah leader, it's about the community coming together, "" Foyan said.
As a result, "Street Kim?" Surprisingly, like falling in love and marrying his wife, documents the personal aspects of Ferrell's life.
"I felt like crazy," said Ferrell, laughing at his first view of the finished product.
"But when I was doing this and humanising black people, I understood that there might be some sensitivity," he said.
In addition, Ferrell's story consolidates the role of black gay women in the Back Lives Matter movement and puts it back in the centre.
Two of the movement's three founders, who derided the # BlackLivesMatter slogan on social media in the wake of the murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, describe themselves as gay.
"Black gay women in leadership generally kept the movement alive," Ferrell said, "and that's because we are continually at war on many fronts.
Black gay women have to bear all the weight of it. "
Fogan agreed, saying: "The movement is really being kept alive by black women and many gay black women."
Still, Ferrell insists that "this is not something in the old-fashioned fountain of action" and that he was not chosen because of their identity.
He says: "He was the one who moved this energy."
'but it's not a occurrence for him to be on the front lines, because, as a black gay woman, there's a lot to lose by living a life in these intersections.
You can feel his energy off the screen. "
In Ferguson, meanwhile, news cameras have already gone, but there are worrying racial connections between the community and the police.
Ferrell is under surveillance for another 2.5 years due to the closure of the highway during a demonstration.
My house describes the socio-political atmosphere in the region, which it says is a "mess" in one word.
Still, he meets the song he excelled in his memory exactly three years ago, when he took to the streets of Ferguson.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our treasures. "
George Voulgarakis: I think it is obvious that we are addressing the issues effectively.
Kukan: Again, I don't want to speculate on the future of the dialogue, but I believe that a practical and political solution will have to be found.
Moscow supports Serbia, which opposes a proposal by former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari on Kosovo's status, calling for "supervised independence."
Cadastro officials are expected to record about 6.7 million totals of about 310,000 hectares of land in less than four years.
The footage shows the president focusing on the stage to listen to a woman asking for help as he addressed the crowd in the city of Ploieski during a local election campaign five years ago.
The Serbian delegation wants several autonomous municipalities with links to each other and Belgrade, and Pristina opposes attempts to "divide" ethnic groups.
Rossin, who met with Serbian Minister for Kosovo Slobodan Samardzic on Sunday (March 16th), pointed to Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic's speech at the UN Security Council, in which he said UNMIK is the special administrative authority in Kosovo and that UN Resolution 1244 is the only legal framework to be implemented.
Archaeologists, environmentalists and international NGOs are trying to find ways to save the 1,800-year-old archaeological site, which will be under the waters of a new dam this November.
But when the Turkish government said it was committed to launching the dam as planned, archaeologists launched a large-scale effort to save items found in the area before it was flooded. Since 1994, numerous sculptures, ceramic fragments, mine findings and glass artefacts dating back to the Roman and Byzantine times have been discovered.
"The foundations of Macedonia's new judicial system are laid today," Justice Minister Mihailo Manevski said. "I hope that the judges who will perform for the first time the right to elect members of the council will choose the best candidates."
Off the field, the security issues that plagued the World Cup in South Africa were also evident inside and outside the Peter Mokaba Stadium in the city of Polokwane.
As disappointment continues in Macedonia after last week's NATO summit in Bucharest, the government is consulting to resolve its name dispute with Greece.

A mere similarity: Artist uses Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits
In the middle of the room at the New York Fridman Gallery, there are plenty of faces that are white, black and casual, each similarly similar to one another that is almost certain.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, with eyebrows and cut hair sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning, a former intelligence analyst who is serving his 35-year sentence after leaking classified diplomatic messages through the WikiLeaks website, as he is known, has sent his cut hair from the Fort Leavenworth prison.
A Municipal similarity is the name of the new exhibition, which opens on 2 August.
This is a product of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines his discipline with his expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender woman and a leading dissident whose sentence, three days before the end of his tenure, was pardoned by Barack Obama.
Dewey-Hagborg, who created 30 portraits by analyzing DNA algorithmic removed from Manning and using what a person with this ginger datum might look like, has not only revealed the probability of DNA databases (there are plenty of ways that can be interpreted), but perhaps a little bit of intuitive interpretation from the core of the comments.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but clearly describes herself as a woman in more heroin, was convicted of 20 offences in 2013, including six from the Cassation Act, computer fraud and theft.
His image was put under pressure by the prison, as such, he had only one photograph: A sandy, black white self-esteem in which Manning, who was visibly enraged, sat in the driver's seat, wearing a plain palm perfume that mattered to him.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had success with the enormous calm of her 2012 project, the more Garden Presidents.
In it, he produced portraits sporting DNA from the drawings of forensic pieces, such as cigarette butts and beards, to paint a picture of what these people might look like.
Exactly at this time, he received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They were doing an interview with Chelsea Manning when she was at the Happiness and they wanted a kind of portrait that could accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg revealed at a press preview of the new exhibition.
He was also unable to visit at this time, and his photo was not taken, so they reached out to Chelsea and asked if he had any interest in making a DNA portrait.
The artist and his imprisoned inspiration were unexpected letter friends, making a lot of letters worth over the course of two years.
They even discovered the suppressed Immortals, a caricature book illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, in which the president forgave Chelsea's sentence and imagined a future in which he could see the exhibition personally.
It was kind of a happy coincidence that Obama indeed asked for Manning's release a few days after the book was released, good after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas.
While Donald Trump has found new, retweeted ways to further fuel the sharp divisions that have been asked to wage war on those leaking information about the government and transgender troops and tampering with him, there is also something deep and powerful about this exhibition, which is now opening.
"Things happen for a reason," Dewey-Hagborg said when asked about the strange timing of all this.
A written artist bet on the wall of the gallery is, of course, Manning's signature in cosy dimensions is below that (the point of the royal "i" letter was put with heart), calling for an end to "automatic discrimination" based on gender, race, sexuality and culture. "
On the face of the wall, he has mitochondrial DNA sex: A lot of C, G and A written with lead hearts...
By incorporating 200 letters (or nukleotides based on the words of the artist's soulful inspiration), Dewey Hagborg wanted to tell us all, at least as biological wounds, how frustrating we are to each other.
"What I hope people will take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about the issue of who we are and how open the genetic dysfunction is to interpretation, how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video business Takeaway Anthem is on display.
"DNA data can tell a lot of different stories, and that's 30 of those stories," he said.
The final piece in the series, held in a single room, is a page from the short cartoon that had previously been promised.
Here, Manning is shown leaving the King Kong style, the Discovery barracks of the United States of America, with a hug.
"Whether they have silenced your speech or won," he writes.
"So it's never okay." "
"This came straight from a letter he wrote to me," he said, from Philadelphia.
"When I still talk about it, my tattoos are dirty," he said.
Manning has yet to see the exhibition personally (as pretty envisaged by the cartoonish book), but when she sees it, she will be greeted by masks, her own genetic instincts gathered like a group of protesters in the middle of the room.
Like everything else in the series, up to Manning's paint (5 "2, Manning's lifetime), whose genetic paparazzi were written with lead hearts, which was particularly done.
"In the past, I've coached them to the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted it to be perceived as a collective movement, shaped by Chelsea, which was also like the movement behind his liberation," he said.
Northwestern education officer and Oxford University employee wanted for murder
A nationwide hunt for a Northwestern University education officer and an Oxford University employee who is wanted as a suspect after a man was found stabbed to death on a luxury apartment floor in Sikago, police said.
Cook administration area records show that on Sunday, arrest negotiators were issued for first-degree murder without bail for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the killing of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
Cornell-Duranleau (26) died after being stabbed several times, the documents say.
A warning issued by the Sikago Police Department was told a body had been found on July 27.
Officers received a phone call, reached out to the Grand Plaza flats and found the victim with a number of deep cuts to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was announced dead at the scene and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a murder while police are actively searching for two suspects, official sources said.
Lathem has been documented since 2007 at Northwestern University in microbiology and immunology.
In an email, Alan K. Cubbage, who is the vice president of university relations, said Lathem was on administrative leave and banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a circumstantial case, which is under investigation by the necessary authority, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior finance assistant at the University of Oxford.
"We are in touch with the police of the United Kingdom and we are ready to assist the US investigative authority in any way they need it," a spokeswoman for the university and the University of Somerville said in an email.
The bet was also told that Warren's colleagues were in shock and wanted him to turn himself in.
Communications Chief Anthony Guglielmi of the Sikago Police Department said he strongly encouraged the suspects to surrender to authority.
"The police have an idea of where they are, but our efforts to identify him are concentrated," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities were helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police had received a phone call from the Grand Plaza building manager, who had just received a mysterious clue that something had happened in the flat at 1008.
Police described the scene as too horrific.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also happened on July 27.
Lathem and Warren were in the building were confirmed by security cameras, he said.
"We believe that the victim had a relationship with the professor Latham," Guglielmi said.
The management staff at Grand Plaza issued a statement telling residents: "Police are still working the victim's timeline and past and are investigating a series of satellites, including a possible domestic incident."
Italy seizes German ship
Italian police said the vessel, called Iuventa, which is in search and rescue operations for asylum seekers in the Central Mediterranean, was seized on Lampedusa Island yesterday.

Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "In the short term, we will complete the WADA roadmap."
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would take a long time to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) to become reworking.
"A specific evolution has been completed in meeting the roadmap criteria, RUSADA has acquired the right to plan and conduct testing in collaboration with UKAD (United Kingdom Anti-Doping).
The WADA road map has been updated in this context, "Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister was evaluating the second part of the WADA Review Update Road Harvey, which was recently published on the institution's website, weighing the criteria governing RUSADA's reworking.
According to Mutko, that does not include anything to worry about Russia.
"Everything has been announced, it will all be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future, "he added.
But it is a criterion that has been promised on the list; Russian Anti-Doping officials have to publicly acknowledge the reported results of a state-sponsored doping investigation, approved by WADA, claimed in Russian sport by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren.
Mutko joked: "While our Anti-Doping system accepts a failure, we are conducting the investigation.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no state program, and we will not accept something that did not exist. "
Mutko's comments echoed those of the head of Russia's Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission, Vitaly Smirnov.
Speaking to Russian broadcaster RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov acknowledged his past problems with Russia's Anti-Doping bodies, but added: "We have said at a number of opportunities that the report includes positions and regulations that create dissent.
No one seems to accept the report as unconditional, "Smirnov added.
RUSADA was suspended by WADA in November 2005, when it conducted doping checks inside Russia in the wake of the doping scandal.
However, this hazardous test planning and coordination had been allowed under the supervision of international experts and the United Kingdom Anti-Doping (UKAD).
Theirs had said that after a visit to the institution's headquarters in Moscow, WADA Director Olivier Niggli RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" to get back to work.

Start-ups to help your company isn't the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to gauge employee happiness in the e-commerce start-ups, but the polls didn't work.
The answers were generally uncertain, unhelpful or, worse, deceptive.
Even if he committed to anonymity, some employees did not trust the process.
"There was never any consistency or objectivity," says Errett, who runs Madison Reed, an e-commerce company of 75 on hair care in San Fransisko.
He called someone from the outside for help.
A new kind of human resources start-up comes out to help companies understand how their employees feel.
These include producing a software whose specialized purpose is to measure employees' gravity and licensing it, allowing firms to conduct crippling options surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint assistance lines, and, in some cases, by bankrolling top executives and providing a directory board.
"There are now tools that monitor your health, such as Strava and Fitbit, but where is your company's Fitbit?" Added Jim Barnett, founding partner and president of Glint, a Redwood City start-up whose software analysis tools measure the legitimacy of employees by companies.
Errett says using Glint to better understand what his employees think and feel after three years.
Along with offering crippling surveys and select surveys to specialized teams, it offers a map of what parts of the company receive the most complaints, and a glance at which director has low likability scores; thus, their reasons can be eradicated.
Not to be the next Uber, companies are starting to understand that they need to know about the culture of their workplace; Uber has been in a scandal since a former employee weighed an environment of harassment in which those who openly say what they think are punished in a blog post.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for surveillance means a very profitable business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth $118.7 billion by 2020, according to financial technology drinks website Let's Talk Payments.
Interest in Denver Colorado-based start-ups Converse, which helps companies identify and curb bad behavior, and the event escalated earlier this year amid controversy over Uber's intimidation.
Convergent has close to 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a customer.
Like Glint, Converse allows companies to make personalized "nabbed" surveys, collect real-time secret responses and release maps of problematic areas.
It also offers a help line that can be anonymously message that employees can report bad behavior.
If the president is charged, the complaints go straight to the board.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Coverment, said: "The public court has taken on the regulators."
Quinlan said: If a company treats its employees badly or is not ethical, it could face costly consequences for consumer boycotts, employee vulnerabilities or lawsuits, even if regulators don't step in.
Restaurant chain Ruby Tuesday, which has more than 25,000 employees in 500 positions, has been using Convergent for more than a year to ensure that its employees are aware of the principles and procedures and offer a way to easily reach the company's headquarters.
Previously, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he had to find a phone number or email belonging to the company's headquarters, he was making an official complaint and hoped it would be taken seriously.
They are mostly eye frightening and disturbing experiences, not a good way to track employee complaints, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's chief legal officer.
But now, with the company using Convergent, problems concealed from executives who previously sat in office, city or provincial distance (such as discrimination, harassment or unfair pay practices) can be identified and solved faster.
Vitrano, who runs Ruby Tuesday's risk management group, said: "I can get even closer to this employment experience with a total, 360-degree perspective."
"Also, we protect our shareholders against business cases," he said.
In 2002, after accounting firm Arthur Andersen sank due to a breach of ethical values stemming from the Enron scandal, companies dealt with ethics, values and engagement with employees more seriously in 2002, "Quinlan said.
But after "social media came into its own," the firms realized they would not be able to stop their dirty washing from becoming viral.
"Before the technology was used to oversee the ethics, people were using hope as a strategy," he said.
They offer both Glint and Converse software as a service and receive recurring fees for the use of their products.
This is a business model and opportunity, with the approval of risk capital investors who support both start-ups.
Convergent received $10 million in funding at the branch from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital to $47 million.
Glint provided $10 million on the app from Bessemer Venture Partners and increased its total funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly a surprise, given the nature, culture and risk capital of companies that depend on each other.
The increasing quantity of research suggests that today's employees expect more from their workplaces than before.
In competitive markets, such as silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are only minimal requirements.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted, valued and giving their time to a company with a positive mission.
Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convergent and Glint, said: "When people are happy to be in a company, when they feel their voices are heard, and the work they do is sweet, they are more intimate to make that company successful."
Investors would make gains when their own portfolio companies did a good job; companies would do a good job if their employees were intimate and they felt they belonged to the company.
If third-party analysis tools promise to increase employee insight and sense of belonging, it's not surprising that they find support.
Having data on employee commitment is important to workplace culture experts.
But the data does not work if those responsible for the company do not act.
In fact, a company can create an expectation that change is coming, if it wants feedback from its employees.
And if the expectation doesn't come fast enough, or not at all, it can be disappointing and make employees feel like they are coping.
"If you're going to ask for 4000 proposals, you need to be ready for 4000 speeches," said Russell Raath, head of consultancy at business management firm Kotter International, which sees firms make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow it, employees will think, 'Are you really appealing to me?
Does he care?
And if he doesn't care about you, why should I care? '
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who runs monthly employee surveys, was able to act on the same day when a problem was reported in Glint.
And after collecting feedback from employees who were embarrassed by the decision-making mechanism and the speed of the quality of communication, he was able to reorganize various teams within the company and added communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company receives new insights about its own employees, and in the long run, it hopes it will translate into being able to keep more workers in such an induction, which is known to have a high number of employee entry outcomes.
Vitrona said: "If you are not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you lose people."
"And if you lose people, you're going to lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you will lose the firms. "

It means a long day for the Bruins for the NCAA to remove two training sessions every day.
They arrive at 11pm and a glimpse of UCLA football players are stuck to chat on one side of the team's new training ground on campus.
Some have gotten over their forwards, revealing their anxious back from the term, which is from the crucible of the first day in training camp.
For a significant part of the team, these empty minutes make up the mid-day break.
After three hours of training, players registered in summer classrooms will return home and work on final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6.30am the next morning.
"The next three days is a feat for these guys," Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before returning to the arena on Sunday.
Held to lift the burden on the players, the NCAA's removal of two training sessions a day, at least until the finals ended on Friday, actually extended their day.
So UCLA's first three training sessions were programmed to start at 7.15pm, in a way that would adapt to the players' already tight schedule.
The equivalent of not having two training sessions a day is more of a training session a day; the Bruins take the start of the camp close to a week from last season and train at summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood during summer school.
They plan to train 18 until August 20, before starting formal game preparations for their opener against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said the NCAA supports the rule change, although it has added new items to the players' busy work schedule.
Mora said: "We put a huge burden on them for three or four days, and that's very challenging."
"And they went through it anytime soon; they work, they're amazing kids.
I think we'll have more time when we get to the gym, it's going to be really amazing, "he said.
UCLA will stop their training when the camp is over; the luxury hotel Luskin Center, which is held in a football ball ramp on the side and at the end and closes the back of the net with a protective network, is no easy task given its spaces are spinning in the line of view.
The Bruins players are scheduled to settle in the hotel from the start of this week, but Mora admits there could be a problem when those rooms are vacant at the time of the season.
"We will have security," Mora said.
'it's a real concern and it's not too far-fetched to think that someone is going to rent a room and sit there and videotape a training session.
If there is a video recording of a training session, that's a good thing for the bat.
But we will have security there and we will have security at parking place 8 above.
We will do our best with what we have.
I'm not going to worry too much about that.
We have a plan. "

Facebook ramps up its story verification power to fight against fake news
Facebook will send more potential fake articles to third-party story verifications and show their findings under the original sharing; this is how the world's largest online social network said on Thursday that it was trying to fight what it called fake news.
In a statement on its website, the firm said it would use updated machine learning to identify possible fraud and send them to story verification, which would potentially show story verification results below the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the main distribution points for news known as fake news, which many think influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political topic in Europe, with French voters hit by a flood of fake news before the presidential election in May and Germany backing a plan to fine social media networks in the run-up to the election there if they fail to swiftly remove hate conversations.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement that a test of the new story verification feature is being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing which stories are being discussed by third-party story verifications, people are asking for more resources about what they read and share to make decisions based on information," Sara Su, Facebook news flow product manager, said in a blog.
He added that Facebook would continue to test the "relevant article" and would work on other changes in the flow of news to reduce fake news.

Creating a cartoon: The story of a Fortress in Britain
In his recent past, the ubiquitous Scotney Fortress was featured in a Squeeze music clip and was a refuge for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But right now, Scotney, who inspired a cartoon written by Jamie Rhodes of Yorkshire with super hair, passionate about historical documents, has masterminded a 700-year-old turbulent history from his comfortable seat in the Bewl River valley in Kent.
"I find it very nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says, effortlessly.
"How is it a personal bond is to keep this letter in my hands," he said.
A Heart in the UK, stretching from the Edward takeover to the Middle Ages, each story comes from a different artist named after the United Kingdom (Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg), who lived in the family.
This is not Rhodes's first book, based on an archipelago: He also wrote the teeth of Our Adams in 2014, a project he found unexpectedly emotional, which took inspiration from the stories in the British Library.
"Even my eyes were piled on the fingerprints on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for King James fans," she said.
"This was his head finger's watch!
The letters also always smell is because at the time you lit a fire for light.
For someone in the future for 300 years, this smell feels like he's in there, too.
Oh, I'm delighted with the archives! "
As someone who falls in love with old labels, it seems too good to get support from the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and to stay for almost four months in a net ("to be honest, I've overcome bitterness by making it more than necessary for me to be greeted warmly."
Rhodes spent his days exploring the "new" stronghold from the Victorian era, scanning archives and working out a number of treasures and antiques, such as backyard heads assembled on the walls of the property and bottles that had spent centuries in hoses.
He talked to hackers, brokers, and sometimes artists who worked on the illustrations of his book, circling the territory and ruins of the old fortress.
Then at night, he would "drink a visitor and put in writing."
It's an unknown to see the detailed history of Scotney, as the National Trust was able to access full access only when the last inheritance, Elizabeth Hussey, died in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, staff had only begun to address the archive, which he wears: "For centuries, the annual aristocrats were saying: 'Oh, throw him in the ceiling.'
The diaries are letters from the days of the British empire, maps that determine the limits of who has what: "You'd think the territorial disputes would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a hug tree where the two families were fighting over.
Divorce be, guys! "
Some of the stories in the collection, including The Labourer, which left the newly built fortress to join the Village Issue in 1381, use the net as a springboard to make a broader introduction to British history.
"In this book, Three Families of the city and Sussex, there is a recording of a riot in 1380 in the net," says Rhodes.
"The peasant Isil had started around this and I thought that a rebellion could be a good starting point.
Perhaps these two may be linked? "
Other stories are tightly linked to the history of the fortress, for example, The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family, who spent seven years hiding a Cizvit pop-up during the British Isles.
Or The Smuggler, featuring 18th-century smuggler Arthut Darrell, who is thought to have filled a coffin with stones and stalked his own funeral (a disclosure made years later when his coffin was removed from the land).
Darrell's Rhodes' highest-profile Scotney family: "These bees seemed like pay-per-view, they were always getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrell men resolved their debt crises by marrying wealthy older women; I imagine them as a group of affluent men who are hungry to exchange for female shifts, "he said.
Rhodes, who finished his tenure at the net, is seeking other technical-writing experiences.
In Finnish wildlife, he completed a two-week job for a cartoon about Elymánmoski, the site of an artist at the beginning of the 20th century, which has since been retaken by nature.
But Scotney holds a separate place in his heart.
"I was sorry I left," she said.
"It seems like: 'Oh, now I have to go and face the possible real life of landing,'" he said.
Bulgarian nurses, Kristiana Vulcheva, Nasya Nenova, Snezhana Dimitrova, Valentina Siropulo and Valya Chervenyaska, and Palestinian doctor Ashraf Friday Hajuj, who was granted Bulgarian citizenship in the days leading up to the early hours of talks between a European delegation and Libyan authorities.

Even at the cost of damaging regional stability, the Alliance has sought to advance its own interests in return for its interests.
"Albania is one of the first countries to feel the consequences of this traffic, because the known corridor, which runs through Turkey, Bulgaria, Macedonia and other Mediterranean countries, does not make Albania one of the first countries to face the traffic," he added.

Meral Akshener reacts to 'Maho
Ismet Buyukhatan, general secretary of the Nationalist Movement Party, issued a written statement in recent days about allegations of resignation in social media and media coverage of the MHP.
He used social media and the phrase that "adult flows" to the MHP "from the corners of some old rifle Marxists," suggesting that "games and stalls are being applied to prevent the country's movement from continuing to exist under the MHP after 12 September."
"It's crazy," he said.
"By failing to rehabilitate the historic existence of the Turkish nation, the more record that fails to attract the Turkish" homeland "is disruptive, the criminal dossier is nigh, the idea is bullshit, and if the mind is mixed, it shook their hands," he said.
"Now they've come out," he said, "with 410 people from the leadership and members of the MHP Cocaine Georgian Provincial Service and 215 in the MHP Bursa district of Pennsylvania."
Public opinion is being misled by unsubstantiated messaging reports of 250 resignations, 300 resignations.
The lie in newspaper suits has been toppled, and deception has deepened.
The number of enquiries in the places mentioned, as there is no resignation that reaches this number of hands, does not cross the fingers of one hand.
In what he described as "alleged" about the resignations, he said public opinion was meant to be misleading and perception management, again with polls he called "so-called."
"Their propaganda and campaigns to create a perception of the MHP will be counterproductive," he said.
He said the MHP is an important and indispensable actor in Turkish politics.
The power of the former Marxists is not enough, as the MHP has soared to destroy the place it acquired in the consciousness of the Turkish nation.
A dirty account lies behind all the comments that have been made, the perception management texts applied.
Because politics and the media have set their sights on the MHP base.
Of those who have done no wonderful work and vigilance in favor of our party when we are among us, it makes no sense in our view that they are now stepping down.
What's the gamble that those who have failed to execute from our party to account for their Neft have resigned?
In their lives, no-one who hasn't touched the MHP holistically, who hasn't shared our memories, didn't understand our countries, didn't agree with our struggles, and whose mindset that has always stood on the edge, even if they agree, should find themselves other busy.
It is a behind-the-scenes effort by those who fail to withhold the unity and integrity of the Nationalist Movement Party to try to extract fitness, debate and hysteria.
And hopefully, he'll go back to the terrace and hit the owner.
The Nationalist Movement is the last surviving stronghold of the Turkish nation, despite heavy evictions.
"Political heartlands," "political captains" for those he says are targeting the MHP, he said in a statement. "The nationalist movement is not without ownership."
"They're not going to be able to achieve their goal, regardless of the cost of external corals inside the root, fueled by the ocean beyond," he said.
"The faceless traitors will return to the desert and be drunk in the blaze," the MHP's Buyukhatan said in a statement, outlining opposition parties and terrorist organizations together.
Yesterday, we were thrust into the new tactics and games of those plotting "MHP, Turkey without the MHP"; the government without the MHP, we fought to the end with those who want Parliament without the MHP.
And now we're going to disrupt the games, we're going to perfect the players.
"The pattern of the Country is the MHP," he tweeted, implying Meral Akhener.
This is their issue, but the only desire from these controversies is for them to be a replacement for where they go.

Washington changes Green Card Rules
The media quoted President Donald Trump as saying there would be a new US immigration plan that changes to the Green Card rules.
It calls for reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 units a year, stricter rules for temporary work permits and restrictions on visas for the family.
The new rules were offered by Republicans and backed by the president.
The draft code will be debated on both sides of Congress.
"This law will reduce fault, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and do so by changing the way the United States gives Green Card to citizens of other countries," he said.
The law will reduce zinc migration and replace the current regime.

The Turkish Language Corporation has reached its twenty-seventh edition of the Review Manual, with work done by the Working Group of the Turkish Statement and Work Manual.
Let's just make clear; there has been no change in this pressure in relation to established rules, as well, in order to bring the writing rules to permanent enthusiasm, to radicalise them, so to ensure unity in the writing.
In the guideline, published by the Turkish Language Institution in 1996, the principle of meeting the middle road in writing was also observed in this repression, with the aim of taking the writing based on the documented forms.
This pressure of the Employee Manual has been co-operated with the latest edition of the Turkish Statement, and new problems with writing that arose as a result of developments in the language have been linked to a rule, and the issues that have not been addressed in previous representations have been brought to a writing course.
The Working Group of the Early Turkish Statement and Writing Manual has taken into account the frequency of use with the principle that writing is a habit and tradition while reviewing hundreds of examples of each rule.
Despite some problems with the Latin Turkish article, which we have been using for more than eighty years, we can now say that the writing has become a tradition.
Without a doubt, the work of the Turkish Language Institution, which reached eighty years, plays an important role.
The task of preparing, writing and publishing the writing guidelines in our country has been given to the Turkish Language Institution with the circulation of the 10th Amendment of Resolution 664, which is based on Article 134 of the Constitution.
Since its inception, the Turkish Language Corporation has been trying to fulfill its duty in setting writing rules and publishing writing guidelines.
The Working Group of the Turkish Language Corporation's Early Turkish Statement and Writing Manual has stayed tirelessly on every rule, every software, with the principle of ending the debate in the writing and promoting the writing rules and forms of writing that everyone will use.
Writers comment on Fenergare-Sturm Graz match
She had got back to the euphoria and visibility that I couldn't find for two seasons, I couldn't see....
A "mangled wild" team set up by Aykut Kocaman in absence was on the pitch to make the deal to "stand behind us" with his fans.
We can bring criticism of his game, positions or performances, but I haven't watched a game that has been so functioning and looking for it for a long time.
He had made it clear in the first game, but yesterday he put his apolettes on his own wearing shoulder; Fenerbahce's commander on the field is now Valbuena.
His age had been problematic while he was transitioning, but Kocaman had a joke in his remarks, "character who didn't give up."
30 years ago, we gave the name right of the atomic chart to Riza Chalmers.
If he does deal with it, it will be the commentary that will be most fitting for the French player.
He was all over the pitch, joining all the pitching organizations and always taking responsibility and scoring a goal, burying a huge display on his shortstop.
The fact that Alper played the lead left the Sturm Graz team "limited" on the pitch for a long time to stay in the second striker position.
Fenerbahce consistently looked forwards to overcome such a hard wall as he clinched the lead without a corner.
They dominate the ball, but they can't produce effective pitches in any opposing penalty area.
This appearance may bring a "centre-laden" interpretation, but we are faced with the game that hesitates to throw a punch at Ahmethan, unable to put the only centre-back in his hands in position.
Either the team did not trust the young player or his performance needs to improve a little bit more.
After the scoreboard was 1-1, they failed to take advantage of two clear opportunities.
It was important for them to go round, but it would have made the night even better to get those fans who applauded the players' struggles to "score."
There will probably be another 1-2 new transfers by the end of the market.
But the reality is that Fenerbahce's biggest need is number 12....
We are on the verge of a very brilliant and spectacular season with this style of play that carries the hearts of those in the stands trying to play the lead.
Aykut Kocaman's machine drives his range, and he needs a bit more time.
They're good as physical quality.
The quality of play will improve as well.
You also see very clearly that all of the players on the pitch have increased self-confidence.
They need a lot of glamorous applause yesterday for a new page.
The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
A new report on technological advances in the sex robot industry comes as full-time 2017 thinks it can't be even more awkward.
Yes.
Sex robots are a big event now.
Recently, the Agency for Robot Science (FRR) published a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
We should take their rise seriously, according to Santa Sharkey, a retired professor of robotic science and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR.
Customers can choose the robot's eye colour, the shape of the breast and the type of makeup.
Mr Sharkey said of the release of the new report: "People laugh at them crazy, but firms are actually an eye-catching lover and we'll see them even more."
Modern sex babies marveled at robots with silicone magazines, which are warm to touch from their siblings, which can be inflated, with responses such as specifically humans carried out by artificial intelligence.
Users can also personalise their robots to suit their own blood by choosing everything from the robot's eye colour, breast shape and make-up type or color.
But with so many robots having "personalities" to innovate a Stepford Women, it becomes even more disturbing.
Modern sex babies evolved into silicon derived robots.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to personalize their own robots based on character features they find attractive (reservations, for example).
Then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion, including "Frijit Farrah," which come with preprogrammed personalities, giving the impression of reservations, and "Wild Wendy," with an "adventurous" personality.
True Companion's website enthuses: "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that suits your personality as much as possible."
So whatever you like, he loves it, he doesn't like it if you don't like it, etc.
They also have mood during the day, like the same real people.
He can be sleepy, be willing to talk, or "in full mode."
There are plenty of disturbing sides about the rise of sex robots: Not only does it replace real humanitarian relationships, but too itchy female personality characteristics, if you approach Frijit Farah, rape calls are the most thoughtful.
On its website, True Companion likens Roxxxy to a vibrator, but to what it is for men.
"If it can be a vibrator of the woman (it's the same in the text), why shouldn't men have a Roxxxy as well?" She explains on her website.
But these sex robots aren't just a conquest or sex toys.
Their emergence and growing complexity point to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to the desire for sex through painstaking, an optional addition.
Many men will not naturally possess sex robots, and for now they are on the outskirts of consumer culture, even though the FRR points to their growing popularity.
But leaks from the aircraft can be highly taught about the course of the period in which we live.
A lot of people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them the right to be so.
It's hardly a coincidence that these soulful sex robots are emerging at a time when women's rights are under threat worldwide, with the presence of a president in the White House who boasts of sexual assault on women.
The most tumultuous part of The Handmaid's Tale TV series is not the depictions, illuminated bodies or the spotlight that show all the details, but how realistic the look feels.
The Republic of Gilead is a sudden change, but at the moment it doesn't feel like it's such a big change.
The idea behind these sex robots is to create as many physical similarities to real women (of course, at the rates of porn film stars) to the extent that it is technologically possible.
Their creators want them to give a sense of people when they touch and to imitate the movements of a real body.
But when business comes to their "personalities," robots can't clearly represent real women.
They can't leave their wives or leave them.
They don't have any activities or past stories, nothing to expose their independence or disrupt the fantasy of total slavery.
In other words, they are slaves who enjoy it.
Or, by the tail of 2017: The jokes.
Attack on American military convoy: There are dead and wounded...
A suicide bombing in Karabakh, Kabul, Afghanistan, targeted foreign military forces operating in the country.
There were also injuries in the blast, which killed 1 NATO troops and three civilians, and five of the wounded were American soldiers in the convoy and 1 were transgender people working with NATO forces, it said.

The injuries are not life-threatening.
Local media say the suicide bomber was a member of the Taliban.
Trump's big mate?
Showing Mitt Romney as a health-care timber
It was the reality of the Trump era that the political divide that has polarized US voters divided families on a micro scale.
Around Christmas and Senior Day, newspapers in the United States were full of how to deal with the nightmare of relatives who voted for Trump.
We all make an effort to patch our own filtering balloons into the lyrics.
Less talked about is Trump's power to bring families together.
I address this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Sikago and is intertwined with the Republicans in our family, visits us in New York this week.
He reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
All that Trump recognizes, including his Republican brother, whom he has championed for decades about policy with his creation in the White House, is on the same side, multiple and awkward.
At the dinner table, that's a good thing, of course, but it seems to me that in a broad context, this carries significant risks.
The left has been revived by Trump, but the blunt effect created by his presidency has created the power to be pushed to the left for all of me.
When we talk about "normality" and Trump, we are talking about the terrible possibility that one day his strange behavior may no longer be scared.
Indeed, there is a more terrible long-term scenario that, in it, Trump is "normalizing" right-wing Republicans who come up against his own standards, and they seem to be a symbol of multiple logic.
I find myself having nostalgia about the hurricane version of Mitt Romney's thriller, these lanes: The dog in the ceiling of the car, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like), both of which are really mild crimes, according to Trump.
When Trump is gone, he just needs to be at the forefront of the baton to assess that the next Republican candidate provides immeasurable degree of development.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the atrium in Central Park, the largest of the attractions run by the New York parks department and the three best ponies you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the fiberglas designs on the central silk (pals and animals, all of which make awkward slopes, turned to look fearlessly behind their own shoulders), and the music on the temple is genuinely enthusiastic.
In other words, many cliffs of a city can be disappointing: The views of high buildings are starting to get boring, the horizontal line is starting to become too familiar to create too much excitement, and the city's reality doesn't reach its enemy.
Thirty-five years on, and I still haven't completely overcome the day I discovered that Swiss Cottage is not actually a Swiss cat house but (themed bar Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn't count) a vast cycle crossroads in North London.

Meanwhile, I was asked to consider my transaction "experience" between 1 and 5 stars before I passed my credit card at a bonanza this week.
The same thing in the coffee shop on the corner of my street, and then the option of matching the note with a 15% bottle; for what was bought from the counter.
The effect is not just that it slows down what should be a neutral shopping, but also that it puts pressure on the server to bring personality to an event that is never needed.
As the zombie woman in the Bonmarchy lined up as if they were standing up apologies, in frustration, I gave five stars to my experience of giving her a credit card.
They wore the monkeys as the temperature topped 41 degrees
People flocked to the beaches of Munzur in Tunceli, the site of one of the hottest days of the season.
Young, children, elderly, women and men, who entered the beaches on the outskirts of Munzur Castle as temperatures pushed thoroughly from noon, tried to protect them from the temperature by stretching them in waters such as ice.
Beaches on the outskirts of Munzur Castle were packed, especially as Tunceli residents living in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, France and Britain spent their holidays in their homeland instead of the Aegean or Mediterranean.
Suna Tosun, who is among those who greet at Munzur Place, said she used her preference in favour of Tunceli rather than the western provinces for the holiday, adding: "It was more true to greet the family in Munzur that I didn't want to spend my holiday in the west, to stay on our own land."
"Munzur's water like ice doesn't exist anywhere in the world, and at these temperatures, Munzur is stretching us," he said.
Hasan Ulu, from Germany, said he prefers the Munzur Castle coast in Tunceli, rather than the beaches of Cheshire or Bodrum, so they don't regret it.

His last words were 'I think I'm dead, elder mother
Among those killed in the Grenfell Tower fire in London, which has so far been announced to be 30, she called her mother at the time of the fire, saying: "I don't want to say goodbye, that's not fair at all."
"Thank you for everything I've done for me, it's eloquent," Italy's Gloria Trevisan said, as well as her loved ones.
Among the dozens who have not been reported following the blaze were Gloria Trevisan, 26, who was sitting on the 23rd floor of the 24-storey building, and her Italian lover Marco Gottardi.
Maria Cristina Sandri, an attorney for the Trevisan family living in northern Italy, said in a statement that it was clear that both teenagers had died, according to information from British competences.
He said the families of young people are suffering a great deal, and he also asked reporters not to insist on getting a statement on the issue.
I think I'm dead, elder mother
Attorney Sandri said Gloria called her mother, Emanuela Trevisan, "on a mobile phone" shortly after the fire broke out and when she listened to these recent conversations recorded by the mother, she cried.
In it, Gloria Trevisan spoke with her mother a few times over the two hours after the blaze, which started around midnight local time.
"Mother, bad things happen here, there was a fire," said Trevisan, who was said to be quieter in his early speeches.
We stayed trapped, we can't go outside.
There's a little bit of smoke, but we expect to be worried, to be saved.
"We tried to get out by opening the door, but there was too much smoke and the assailant was not working either," he was quoted as saying.
Gloria Trevisan, whose anxiety was growing in her subsequent searches as the fire grew, was quoted as saying:
Mother, my whole life is way past my eyes.
I think I'm dead.
I had a life to live before; that's not fair at all.
I don't want to die and I want to help you financially.
I'm sorry I won't be able to embrace you again.
Thank you for everything you did for me, the elder mother.
I'm going to heaven now and I'll help you out there.
This is the fault of the italian government
Gloria Trevisan and her lover Marco Gottardi, both studying architecture, moved to London from the northern region of Veneto in March when they were forced to find work after graduating last year.
Gloria Trevisan, who was only able to find a job in her country with a salary of 300 euros, soon started working in a business in London with a pension of 1,800 pounds (£2060).
"Gloria had travelled to London to help her family," attorney Sandri said, adding that Gloria Trevisan's family was struggling financially.
Unfortunately, our young people are forced to leave the country to save their future and find work.
"The government must immediately address this problem," he said.
Italy's drama, which has failed to provide job opportunities for its young
Gloria's father, Loris Trevisan, also expressed his outrage, saying: "This is the fault of our government, which has forced our young people to flee abroad to find work."
In Italy, the unemployment rate has reached 12 per cent, while among young people, it is 40 per cent.
Amid the escalation of the problem, over the past few years, many Italian teenagers had begun migrating to a number of European countries, particularly in the UK.
Last year alone, the number of young people forced to leave Italy because of unemployment was 110,000.
Italian media commentary on the finalisation of reports of the death of Gloria Trevisan and Marco Gottardi also said it was the drama of a country that was unable to provide business opportunities for its young people.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could ease IBH
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your saturated system.
But a new study claims the opposite: A nutrient rich in meat based protein and dairy products can help to alleviate the signs of those suffering from medicinal insecticide.
This untreated health condition, which affects 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 people in the United Kingdom, causes migraine cramps and bloating, refreshing or bloodthirsty, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are often advised to throw out meat and dairy products to alleviate their signs, but researchers at the University of Washington found that the protein's main aminoasidi triptofin helped develop immune cells that develop a resilient vineyard.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna testified that immune cells are patrolling the vineyards so that microbes kept eating don't secretly enter the gut.
The cells, which are empowered to trigger meditation, are offset by cells that encourage them to stand up by protecting sensitive dogs without harm.
If the balance shifts exponentially toward meditation, the medication can come as a result of affordability.
The experiments revealed a type of immune cell that encourages resilience in flies that carry a specialized bacteria in their vineyards.
And the bacteria needs triptofin, one of the building stones of the protein to trigger the emergence of the cells.
Professor Colonna: 'We have connected between the type of bacteria lactobacillus reuteri, which is part of the insect microbiome, and the development of cell populism, which encourages resilience.'
Fats with more triptofat in their nutrients had more of these immune cells, 'he said.
If the same thing happens in humans, he suggested, a nutrient rich in L. reuteri and triptofan could develop a more resilient, less meditative insect environment.
Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, a post-doctoral researcher, discovered that while working on a type of immune cell that develops resilience, a group of experimental fats have such cells, but not another group that is of the same kind and held in a different place.
He suspected that the disparity was related to, in other words, the bacteria, viruses and muscle communities that live on the mixed-conditioning channel normally.
DNA sequencing of the females' vineyards and found that there were six types of bacteria in fats with immune cells, but that was lacking in females where they were not.
Because they were looked at in a sterile environment, they were given L. reuteri to females that were missing a vineyard Mikrobioma and did not develop such an immune cell, and their immune cells were exposed.
To understand how the bacteria affects the immune system, researchers grew L. reuteri in liquid and then transmitted small amounts of this liquid, which is bacterial to unmature immune cells from fats.
Immune cells have become cells that encourage resilience.
The active component turned out to be a by-product of triptofan metabolism, known as indol-3-lactic acid, when it was carved out of the liquid.
The number of cells increased by about 50 percent when researchers doubled the amount of triptofan in fats' nutrients, but the number of cells dropped by half when triptofan levels were halved.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan said people have cells that encourage the same resilience as females, and most of us house L. reuteri on the mixed-conditioning channel.
It is not known if triptofan side products from L. reuteri evolved as in females in humans, but the disorders in genes that are related to triptofania have been found in people with medicinal intestinal disease.
He said: "The development of these cells is something that we probably want to encourage, because these cells control the meditation on the inner surface of the insects.
Potentially, in cases where L. reuteri is present, high levels of triptofan leads to the spread of this populism, "he said.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United have signed a 'dab' with Nemanja Matic
After the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening, Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed a "damn" with Nemanja Matic.
The £40million transfer from Chelsea began with a 2-1 win in Dublin ahead of the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday in United's last pre-season game and, according to the eyebrows of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira, he also kept his eye on the ball.
But Matic, who was left out in the blue's pre-season tour of Asia, had a serious degree of match consolation squad and was only able to make it 45 minutes; Mourinho admitted it needed to be improved before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence, his horror in the way of thinking... he thinks about football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him to be ready sooner," he said.
Mourinho began to sweep into his first 11 for the start of the season, and, like Matic, new trainers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also made appearances at the Aviva Stadium.
This week, The Independent revealed that Mourinho still wants three more transfers, but the club has already insisted he has done an "extraordinary job" by carrying out three of his four priority transfers.
"I thank the club for taking three of the four," he added.
"I would be happier if they get four out of four, but they did a great deal for me," he said.

"It seems like you were mass," he answered, acting Commander.
The "Made in America" organization has been designated by the White House as an official organization and does not fall under the scope of the Hatch Act.
But even official organizations have political implications.
In the organization, the president addressed the ongoing health care reform efforts in the senate then and praised his efforts to rein in government regulations.
Using aircrafts, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents need to use them to travel.
But it is unusual for them to be formally asked to be used only for the opportunity to take a photo.
Trump noted when his presidential plane moved behind the stage of his first campaign rally in Melbourne Florida in September, and given that his Twitter account was full of messages about his predecessor's use of the presidential plane.
White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters said: "The White House is excited about the 'Made in America' exhibition, where products are made with American materials by American workers from all 50 counties."
The HMX-1 crew often operates training flights in the Washington area and exercises to leave the President of the United States in the southern fence with a spot kick to the White House.
Trump held 58 drills at the HMX-1 White House while he was in Germany for the G-20 summit in early July.
The flight, which was for the Made in America organization, counted on the air crew's need for training later that month, an official said.
Unit helicopters flew an additional 11 hours that day for "support tasks that have nothing to do with the presidency."
The White House said taxpayers were not a burden for any other number involved in the organization.
A spokesman for Sikorksky said its firms were not involved in arranging for the helicopter to be displayed on the southern shore.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights, and it is hard to identify the exact costs that have been hit by the organization.
But according to the Department of Defense's hourly rates for the 2017 fiscal year, the Department of Defense's rate of welcoming VH-3D is $24,340 per flight hour.
Unit records record the airliner's flight time at 30 minutes from its central base at Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico Virginia toward both sides.
The White House claims that the helicopter's actual operating costs are well below that rate.
"It's very disheartening to tax multinationals to remove a giveaway by bypassing the mass-welcome rate forecasts," Walters said.
"This rate estimates cover blanket costs included in staff, maintenance and annual costs," he said.
According to a Rand study in 2015, the Department of Defense's mass-welcome rates do not include staff costs, but they include fuel, maintenance and contraceptive costs.
At the time, Sean Spicer, the former White House press secretary, advocated for the helicopter to be used for that organization.
"It's about showcasing what's been done here in annual America this week," Spicer said.
'and I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contributions to our national security and I guess that even if it's not the thousands, hundreds of people's jobs depend on it.
And, like most Americans, I think we're all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment that many Americans work untimely to do.
So of course it is appropriate to put it forward. "
It's not clear if Trump interacted with the helicopter as it circled the southern shore for the organization, but he stepped into the driver's seat of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky, joking with the media about firm products in its own fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," he said, "I have three of them in me."

GMB concern over investment at McVitie's Glasgow factory
A union is seeking assurances from executives at biscuit manufacturer McVitie's to make a long-term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company remained silent about the future of investment in the Tollcross area.
More than 500 people are employed at the plant, which manufactures Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie's, said it had invested more than 5 million pounds in the region over the past few years.
If there is a change in their operations, employees and union representatives will be "the first to be informed," he added.
In a letter written to the company's facilities manager, GMB Scotland demanded McVitie's "address concerns that funds are not being provided for upgrading production suburbs."
Drew Duffy, senior organiser at GMB, said: "Not being able to see a draw from the facility's chief executive on business needs and an investment plan for the future of Tollcross is deeply worrying to our members.
Families have been working here for generations, and labour intensity has been concentrated in the local community and in Glasgow and its suburbs, a critical basis for adequate employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
From the perspective of jobs, wages and welfare, the Brexit conditions urgently need a mammoth production presence at Glasgow's eastern suburb of McVitie, against rising living costs and chronic production declines. "
A female spokesman from Pladis said: "The facility manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland more yesterday and the company will respond directly because we value our commitment to workers and union representatives.
Two months ago at Tollcross, we had a regular meeting with employees and representatives of the GMB, where a few questions were openly discussed.
Then we explained to our employees that, like all companies that do business in an ultra-competitive and uncertain economic environment, we are continually reviewing our operations, in order to remain competitive, which applies to all of our jobs and facilities.
He added: "We have invested more than 5 million pounds in the Tollcross facility in recent years, especially in production bankruptcies and operational improvements.
We all know the legacy of Tollcross as a production facility, and if there is any change in our delivery operations, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know, "he said.

PSG warned Barcelona three years ago about Neymar's departure?
La Liga side may have been regretting their interest in Marco Verratti

The sensational bid moved the summer transfer period as the Ligue 1 team were ready to break the world transfer record, more than double the previous amount when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United last season for £89m.

Barcelona are known to be frustrated over the style of the offer and Neymar's trying to leave, although a source close to Catalans' leadership insists the club has always done its best to keep an eye on him from Santos' arrival in 2013.
