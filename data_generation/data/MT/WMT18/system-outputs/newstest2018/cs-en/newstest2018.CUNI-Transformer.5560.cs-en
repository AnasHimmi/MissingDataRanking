Civil rights movement issues travel alert for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has issued a warning to people of color travelling to Missouri based on the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"NAACP travel advice for the state of Missouri, effective August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors, and Missouri residents to take extra care when traveling across the state as a result of a series of disputed racially motivated incidents currently occurring throughout the state," reads the association's statement.
The NAACP said it took this step based on current Missouri law, which makes it difficult to defend racially motivated acts in court, as well as law enforcement actions that disproportionately target minorities.
"Civil rights are being violated.
People are stopped by cops because of the color of their skin, attacked or killed," said NAACP Missouri President Rod Chapel for the Kansas City Star.
"We have the largest number of complaints to date."
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organisation to a US state.
Among the incidents cited by the organization were racially charged slurs directed at black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in disputed circumstances earlier this year after running out of gas while traveling across the state and police remanded him in custody without criminal charges.
The travel advice also highlights a recent statement by the Missouri Attorney General's Office stating that black drivers have a 75% higher chance of being stopped by police.
"The purpose of the travel advice is to alert people and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be prepared - they should bring money with them for any bail payment or alert their relatives that they are going to travel the state."
According to the current numbers of the FBI's hate-crime reporting program, there were a hundred incidents of hateful conduct in Missouri in 2015, placing the state 16th among all states.
The travel alert is also a response to a new Missouri law that makes it difficult to sue a company for discrimination in providing housing or employment.

Designer vibrators cost tens of thousands.
"Czechs are not prudish or conservative," says Martin Ráž, who runs the Prague boutique Intimity.
In it you will find designer and luxury erotic aids.
Including those by Czech designer Anna Marešová.
It started out subtly, roughly 12 years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friends went cycling in Moravia.
One of them had not only brought a bicycle, but also a box full of unremarkable-looking vibrators.
"Different moles and dolphins and it was all green and yellow and just completely different," he tells me over lunch.
His friend, with another associate, decided to work with a German manufacturer of designer erotic devices, Fun Factory, which interested Martin, so he volunteered to help out with the marketing.
When the associate left to pursue another profession, he replaced him.
Today, he runs an Intimity boutique in Benedict Street, Prague, where he sells erotic aids in the way that luxury handbags or shoes are usually offered.
And why not?
These are also design items.
Wait, wait, this is what you talk about at lunch, you say?
Oh, come on, don't be such a prude!
It was the Berlin Fun Factory store, designed by acclaimed designer Karim Rashid, that served as an inspiration for the Intimity boutique.
It opened in 2010, and it was a very different concept of the erotic trade than everyone here is used to.
No covered windows, all done in a beautiful, demure style, products displayed more like perfume.
Martin, with his business partner Zdeňek Šebelka, began to consider how to accommodate Prague's business, where it should be and what it should be called.
Intimacy's name appealed to both of them.
"It has something to do with intimacy, and it's also, you might say, tender," he says.
This was followed by the purchase of an Internet domain and a search for suitable space that ran in parallel with various interior visualizations.
In the end, the option prevailed, spreading the shop into a pleasure garden and a bedroom dominated by a bed.
It was prepared for us by Dagmar Štěpánová from the FormaFatal studio.
We found space in 2013.
He didn't seem ideal at first because he's not on the main street, but it made him fit the name Intimacy.
It's intimate.
It's in the aisle next to the main one, so no one peeks at the customers," says Martin Ráž.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to make a store that was different, with branded pretty goods, in an environment where women, who are predominantly our customers, feel good about themselves.
And not to be ashamed of entering such a store in the first place.
When I entered the Intimacy boutique half an hour ago, the street was empty.
Plus, I didn't even feel like I was going to a sex toy store.
Just outside the door, I was surprised by the sheer elegance of the interior I know from fashion boutiques.
Even if there's only female service in the store, making sure women aren't shy about asking for help doesn't mean a man's foot won't come in.
Mostly, gentlemen come here to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
"Most men don't know how to guess the right size, and they choose bigger," Martin says, smiling at the frequent mistake.
It's these prejudices, these old clichés that women need some big tools, and it's not true.
So a bona fide man chooses, say, an unnecessarily large vibrator.
Similarly, men choose mostly black underwear, whereas a woman tends to tend more toward pink.
The absolute bestseller at the moment is a product aptly called Satisfyer.
It must be clear from the look on my face that I don't know what's going on, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's kind of a hands-free clitoral stimulator.
I struggle with the adolescent need to chuckle in admiration at the serious tone with which I am being interpreted.
It's like nothing happened.
And it doesn't really wash.
It comes at a good price and has perfect user references.
We didn't think he'd be so well received.
This is some recent revolutionary news.
The first revolution was caused by a seahorse-shaped vibrator.
He made sure that women became more interested in the design of such products.
The second was a vibrator for We-Vibe couples.
He has completely broken down the taboo that can persist for some men, which is that they see competition in erotic devices.
"Variations are made," he continues.
One engine, two engines, remote control.
That's a popular category.
In a love connection, a woman can have a control in her hand and determine the intensity of the vibrations.
In contrast, a certain flop is the category of attachment vibrators.
At least with us.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose devices and buy classic vibrators, even though they may then use it only externally.
At the same time, it's very popular in Western Europe, especially with younger female customers.
What about men?
It's hard to say whether a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
It would have to be handled a little differently, I guess.
The question is what to offer men," Martin says.
"We, too, have aids for them, but on a limited basis." The most sold is a masturbator, in this case from manufacturer Deng.
It doesn't look like an anatomical imitation of a vagina, but "more like a shower gel or an egg or a futuristic object.
There's a lot of focus on functionality and on in-use experiences.
It's very different in Japan.
It makes me wonder.
I thought Japanese women were very fond of erotic devices, I object.
"That's the Internet reality," it's explained to me.
The mundane one is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic devices are more likely to be associated with being used by women.
In Japan, they are perfectly normal for men, and vice versa, they are taboo for women."
In our waters
Czechs and Czechs are not prudish.
On the contrary, we are quite a welcoming nation.
Certainly unlike countries like Catholic Poland or Italy.
The store's typical client ranges from 35 to 50 years old and "already has some experience with both the sex life and some aids.
She'll come for something nice, better quality, to complement her partner's life, or for herself."
We also don't want to get into bondage and latex specials, because we both don't have the space and it doesn't really fit in here.
Such things might discourage those we seek to target.
Which are people who have always been shy about going to a sex shop because they were afraid something like this would pop out at them.
A lot of the products displayed on the shelves are really appealing.
This is also due to the selection of reputable brands represented.
Some of them even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first ever award was said seahorse "and that triggered a change across the industry.
It started to move away from cheap materials and in turn to work with healthy ones, it started to produce different designs, different colors...
The nice thing is that Czech is behind the design of some, namely popular designer Anna Marešová.
I have to say, I was rather pleasantly surprised at how many people buy those Whoop.de.doo design items from Anna Marešová, even though they are relatively more expensive.
There are customers who go straight for Anna Mares' Venus balls.
She has done a really huge job of presenting, within the Czech Republic and abroad, exactly what we are trying to present - that erotic devices can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Anna's story began as a schoolwork.
Now it's a finished product, which is also made by us.
I wanted to control the production process, and I also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products were made.
Since it is not a large-scale production but a small series, it is certainly more costly than a large series.
I may be going a little upstream, but it seems important to keep up the momentum with us in the Czech Republic.
It could well be that in a few years we won't be able to produce anything," Anna tells me later, agreeing with Martin that our society is becoming more and more open.
There is no negative or negative attitude.
At best, they say, people are embarrassed.
"But then even they start to smile." Currently, Anna Marešová has a vibrator on offer for you to have a personal note made, and is also planning her own lubrication gel this year.
In the year after that, there should be vibrating eggs and other novelties.
The Boundary of Healthy Sex
I wonder where the boundaries of what's okay lie.
Is there anything Martin Raj doesn't sell anymore?
It's awfully hard to define.
What one finds normal may seem totally abnormal to another, so we're more defined by our assortment of branded manufacturers.
None of them engage in any extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have one last question: What was the craziest demand they got?
There was an e-mail just this week in which a lady was asking for a masturbation aid for her boyfriend with a penis twenty-eight centimeters long.
So we had to write to her that, unfortunately, we didn't have anything like that.
There's still the question of whether we've been made fun of," Martin says, eyeing me suspiciously.
Even that happens from time to time...
A blow for Karl Gott.
After two cancers of Alzheimer's!
His friend Charles Christmas is battling a serious illness.
Karl Gott's best friend is fighting a disease that will steal people's memories.
"Yes, I'm afraid it's true," the singer himself confirmed to Lightning.

The Chilean parliament has lifted the abortion ban, the law will be considered by the CPS.
In Chile, there is still an absolute ban on abortion, so it must not be carried out for medical reasons.
"I am sorry that the legislators have filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we argued about in parliament for more than two years," complained Socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members and should receive a new president in late August, who AFP says is close to the opposition.
The law lifting the absolute ban on abortions, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, was passed by the Senate on July 19.
The right-wing opposition then announced that it would challenge the law in court, saying it violated the unborn child's right to life.
MPs postponed the vote on the bill last month until it was analysed by a joint parliamentary commission.
On Wednesday, members approved the motion, after which the Senate did so again.
Under the new legislation, abortion should cease to be punishable in three cases: if a woman's life is at risk, if the foetus has no hope of survival, or if the pregnancy arose from rape.
Similar exceptions have existed in Chile since 1931, according to the Spanish newspaper El País, before women were given the right to vote there in 1949.
An absolute abortion ban in 1989 was introduced by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just months before he left the presidency.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where there is an absolute ban on abortions.
The others are Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
In El Salvador, for example, about 20 women are now behind bars serving up to 30 years in prison for abortion.
In many cases, according to human rights activists, it was a spontaneous abortion, which the court ruled a homicide.

The Trump White House's target is now the Statue of Liberty
Criticism of statues is a sure sign of regime change.
The Americans could tell the story as well as anyone - witness the carefully staged toppling of a statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump regime's key supporters, surely knew what was coming when, in a heated debate with CNN's Jim Acosta on the president's proposals to drastically reduce legal immigrants, he took a symbolic ax to the Statue of Liberty.
It is fitting that Miller did not attack the statue itself.
For that, he would be lynched by a mob of cruise ship owners and Statue of Liberty impersonators.
But he attacked its significance, namely the fact that in 1903 a plaque bearing Emma Lazarus's famous poem was placed on the pedestal, 17 years after the monument was completed.
Miller rebuked Acosta, saying, "I don't want to go into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that shines a light on the world.
The poem that was placed on the pedestal afterwards, to which you refer, is not part of it."
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it, this is not about history.
Above all, these are Emma Lazarus's startling words, which resonate these days - inviting not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poorest:"Let him come to me, who is poor, who is barely allowed to breathe freely, who is a miserable worm in the midst of full cities."
And it is in modern times that we can better than ever watch these "miserable worms" on our screens.
Miller wasn't trying to critique poetry - he wanted to make it clear that these people were not welcome in the US.
This conflict about the statue's significance is part of a massive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict about the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, like her friends who, after her death, had sought to place a plaque with a poem on the base of the statue, knew full well that she was engaging in a high-stakes political game.
The statue was intended to convey the connection between the French and American Republican governments by representing a classic theme, the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus has altered that meaning: in her poem, the female character is not abstract, but has her own voice.
She also has a very different name: the Mother of Exiles.
Merging the poem with the image of a woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, devotees of the right have long sought to reverse that meaning.
In 2010, the well-known commentator Rush Limbaugh - John the Baptist on Trump's rise to power - argued that the Statue of Liberty did not actually invite anyone into the country, but represented an early neo-constructivism, bringing America's flame to a backward world: "The Statue of Liberty is stepping forward.
It carries the torch of freedom out of the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The torch is not meant to light the way to the United States."
Surprisingly, Limbaugh hints at an important point.
The statue's significance depends on your point of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the statue from the point of view of an exhausted and damned passenger who, often after a long and terrifying voyage across the ocean, arrives with hope in his heart in a new land.
It is literally a view of the world through the eyes of people seeking refuge and a chance at a better life.
From this perspective, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that, of course, is a perspective that neither Miller nor Trump will recognize.
Their torch is not meant to light the way, but to inflame the hatred that is their only source of power.

World Athletics Championships 2017: Neil Black sings praise to Scottish team members
Eilidh Doyle recalls when the British team had only two Scottish members
UK Athletics Director Neil Black said the strong squad of 16 Scots in the World Championship team would be a "huge asset to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the WOC in London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes "something special is happening" in Scotland and British athletics could learn a lot from the Scots.
"We're trying to understand and adapt - we'll work on it," said Black.
"I've spoken to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has something to do with what they've done.
Scottish athletics officials think it has something to do with what they've done.
British Athletics: it has to do with what they did.
People on the streets think so, too.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing."
Several Scottish athletes will be vying for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will be competing against Sir Mo Farah in the 5000m, while Eilidh Doyle has been elected as team captain.
"Eilidh is modest.
Her opening statement was amazing," Black said.
"Several athletes, whether Scots or athletes of other nationalities, came out of the room feeling immensely proud and motivated.
The passion and undisguised feelings with which Eilidh spoke were unrepeatable."
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, said it was "incredible" that there were 16 Scottish athletes on the British team.
The previous record from 1983 and 2015 is seven.
The middle-distance runner, Muir, has set five British and two European records in the last year alone.
At the WOC she will take part in the 1500m and 5000m.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who will run the 1500m track, having won the British team races and the Anniversary Games this season.
Doyle recalls her first championship, at which Lee McConnell was the only other Scottish member of the team.
The team captain said she was "very proud" of the fact that not only were a large number of her female colleagues on the team, but in many cases they would also be attacking participation in finals and medals.
"The extraordinary thing about being team captain is that I was elected by the other team members. It was a great honor, but knowing that I was elected by the team members is all the more gratifying," she added.
"Obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots who made the team.
It shows how far we've come.
It's the athletes who will be thinking about the front of the podium.
And my opening statement?
Yes, I think it's a good one.
I merely drew attention to the fact that we can be proud of this year's championships because they are being held on home soil.
It is important to harness the support of the home fans and rejoice in the fact that we are back in the Olympic stadium.
I've got a second chance to race and I'm going to enjoy the surreal atmosphere."
Blocking critics on Facebook: don't run for public office if you can't stand voter criticism
The father of our homeland knew of his criticisms.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to criticize him for anything, from domestic politics to his political views.
Yes, that criticism did not leave him cold.
But he didn't try to silence the critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech may be taken away from us - and the stupid and the dumb shall be led like sheep to the slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland is Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work on starting to act like Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who freely expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
He was sued this week by the American Civil Liberties Union for those acts.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as groundless, and many "who cares" opinions appeared in online comments.
"It's just Facebook," said many users.
Yet it matters.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely Democratic state, this is a hugely popular Republican governor.
He can boast the second-highest favorability of any of the 50 governors.
Hogan is not incensed.
As is evident, he governs his state with self-assurance and strictly adheres to principles.
He has also proved adept at using Facebook as a major means of connecting with his constituents - with no exception being the release of the first photo of a bald head after undergoing chemotherapy.
Blocking people who visit the governor's site - which is a public forum, designated official and administered by his taxpayer-funded employees - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor, saying the blocking of comments was done from a position of moderating posts.
But using an image of Internet trolls, spammers, or angry people is too easy.
The Washington Post interviewed some real people who had their posts deleted.
And that's exactly what they are - real people talking to their elected leaders; a teacher, a businessman and a pastor, no trolls.
As they all said, their comments were polite and considerate, not blasphemous.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his commentary, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Bowie Lakshmi's attorney, Sarma Ramani, Md., inquired about hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
"I politely remarked that I was disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other topical news," she wrote in the Washington Post's comments section.
"I don't like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same subject, they are identified by some as promoting a so-called collective effort, instead of being recognized as a larger group of concerned citizens."
What the governor's staff called "concentrated spam interest," others would probably call "advocacy."
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage posts by blocking critics or deleting negative comments.
It's much more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would require sending employees to the streets to pick up and burn all critical copies or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that's exactly what's happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public official to be criticized for defaming Facebook and other social media sites.
President Trump is facing a lawsuit from Twitter users who were denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
The president of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment in Alexandria, according to District Judge James C. Cacheris, where she barred access to her Facebook page by one of her constituents.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also received a visit from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be too difficult.
In the days of Washington, the low cost of postage had virtually the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily newspapers quadrupled and his position as leader was questioned by many anonymous writers.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People, writing under pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius," wrote letters to newspapers and questioned Washington's decisions.
According to historical documents gathered by people at the Papers of George Washington Project online, petitions were piling up in his office criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation agreement with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of expression, dissent and intimidation lie at the very foundation of our nation.
And a real leader has to accept that.
Czechs have made rapid use of free roaming, consuming more data abroad than at home.
Abroad, Czechs consume more of their tariff than at home.
They move most frequently in Austria, but data consumption in the summer season is dominated by Croatia.
On vacation, on the one hand, they have more time to browse the web, and under the umbrella, they generally don't have the ability to connect to Wi-Fi.
A beach, a swim and a smartphone in your hand.
This is what a typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks like after customers can use the services of its operators at domestic prices.
This is clear from O2's recent statistics.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travellers abroad have more data available on a flat-rate basis than at home.
Little wonder, then, that in Croatia, where few of our own travel through the winter, data consumption has risen even fifty-fold this summer season.
Italy came second in the list of data consumed.
Most minutes are cheered by Czechs from Germany, where many go on business even during the summer.
Croatia visits 800,000 Czechs a year, according to data from the Association of Czech Travel Agents, making it our most popular holiday destination.
However, people here have swapped the book for sharing experiences using a mobile phone.
The record was July 7 this year.
"Tens of millions of photos would fit into the transferred data," said O2's mobile segment director Silvia Cieslar.
Although Croatia leads in data volume, the highest number of Czech users is in neighbouring countries.
Austria comes first, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is up to fourth and Italy is sixth.
We go to Austria for hiking and active holidays, for which we don't have as much time to browse the internet.
"In addition, through Austria, the Czechs are heading right for the Adriatic," Cieslar explained.
While data has seen high year-on-year growth following the release of roaming charges, telephone growth is much lower.
The number of minutes called in roaming has doubled from a year ago.
Germany dominates with a huge lead over other countries.
"Roaming calls are more likely to be used by corporate customers on business trips," Cieslar added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home atmosphere at Renaissance Club
Former golfer Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for a relaxing atmosphere over the next three days at the Renaissance Club in the Scottish Administrative Region of East Lothian, which hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who is from Northern Ireland, succumbed to Paul Eales last year at the nearby Archerfield Links golf course on his way to the final, acting as ambassador for the tournament on behalf of the club's founder and CEO, Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've watched the Renaissance Club slowly grow before my eyes and this year's tournament will show the world its beauty," Rafferty said.
"The players will be able to enjoy the first-class quality of the pitch.
Jerry did a great job.
He is a keen advocate of the game and is proud of his achievements.
This year's tournament is in the right hands."
Englishman Eales will defend his championship for the first time, despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"I feel good about this," the southport golfer said.
"I didn't have a chance to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because the tournament was cancelled the year after I won.
Returning to this part of the country is magical.
It's a beautiful place to golf.
I remember last year when winning meant so much to me and my wife Sharon.
It was a beautiful time I won't forget."
Back on home soil is Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 from the edge this year.
The event will be his first participation since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like to play on home soil," Orr said of Helensburgh.
"You want to do well while feeling a lot of pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I think I'm doing well.
I'm happy with the result so far."
The three players will also be joined on the field by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scottish players on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entry to the tournament is free. £5 for a car with one passenger and £10 for a car with two or more passengers.

Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Land of Gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
In fact, she rarely uses a frying pan.
In her wooden shack, located in the capital of Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the language of the local "note" - right into the fire.
After half an hour, she removes the potato and, with relish, she eats it with unwashed hands.
Bardina sits on the muddy ground - the cottage is not furnished - where she also carries out her daily chores, such as washing clothes in the turbid water from a nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room replaces a toilet.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was assigned no field to cultivate.
Polygamy is common here.
Working until late at night poses a danger: most of the men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol.
"No one dares to wander around the village after five o'clock in the afternoon," says Bardina.
It is a rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum when just 1026 elders were forced to vote in a public show of hands before the occupying army.
The current movement protesting the Dutch rules quickly turned its ire on the Jakarta government, which controlled the entire region except for foreign journalists or civil rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a remote and devastated city, reached after a 90-minute flight from the capital of Jayapura province to Nabire, and then a five-hour stomach-churning ride.
Mass transit doesn't work here.
The town of 19,000 people consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, woollen roofs in shades of gray and rust.
Very few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and virtually no foreigners have looked at this place.
Before the arrival of the Christians, the locals worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
"We weren't used to wearing this dress," says Bardina, pointing to her colorful, hand-knitted turban, dark T-shirt and bright skirt.
"We used to only carry leaves."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province - 28% of the population lives below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy is one of the worst in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's land of gold.
The world's largest and highest-earning gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran of America's Phoeenix, is only 60 miles from Paniai - a rocky province about the size of New Jersey that is home to about 153,000 residents.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua supports an estimated $78 billion worth of timber.
Nevertheless, these riches are a source of suffering for the Papuans and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army.
An investigation in 2005 by the New York Times shows that Freeport paid local Army officials and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 per officer.
Papuans calling for self-government threaten this golden goose and are therefore severely repressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969 and thousands more raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
Mass killings in the Papua tribal area during the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
In the past year alone, Indonesian police have arrested more than 3900 peaceful Protestants in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Brisbane Archdiocese, describes the atrocities that occurred last year as extrajudicial executions, torture - according to another report, rape and electrocution are particularly popular - and the brutal suppression of peaceful protesters.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because the incidents happen every week," said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The situation was made worse by the fact that Papuan resources were attracting colonists to Indonesia.
Of the province's 3.5 million people, 83% subscribe to Christianity, but demographics change with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands - Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javan canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local people are struggling to survive.
"Immigrants started selling chickens and vegetables at traditional markets at lower prices than the local Papuans," explains Abeth You, 24, who was born in Paniai and moved to the capital of Jayapura province for work.
"The indigenous people of Papua - mama-mama (women) - lost their jobs that way."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, nicknamed Jokowi, promised to address inequality and rights abuses as part of his 2014 presidential campaign.
The former carpenter secured and made his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Paniai.
But very little has changed in Papua and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi in the hope that he would heed our call for justice," You said.
The fact is that just two months after Jakowi's inauguration in October, Paniai had a major shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were singing Christmas songs by a campfire in the town of Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers emerged from the gloom of night on motorbikes.
Two of the surprised children told them they should turn on their lights.
One of the soldiers was touched by the rebuke and the tone it was delivered, and later returned with four other soldiers, said local priest Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers chased a group of children in a drunken state and beat them with the butts of their weapons, victims and witnesses reported.
One of the soldiers then fired at a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he slipped into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to a nearby election commission building, and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered on the football field outside the local police station and army headquarters, demanding justice.
They came with ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance - in which one runs in a circle and imitates the singing of birds - of the Papuan Mee Pago tribe.
Several Protestants began throwing rocks at the buildings.
With tensions mounting, the soldiers were ordered over the radio: "If the mob tries to resist at least three times, you are cleared to fire," according to TIME, in an official document whose contents were never published in the local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), head of the Enarotali district Kego Koto, recognised the danger and urged residents to disperse to their homes.
But no one heeded his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist," he told TIME Weekly on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame does not yet know who the shooter was, but in his words, the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people around and a lot of shooting," he added.
One local resident, Alfius Youw, was said by his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, to have been hit three times.
"I ran to the body to make sure it was really him," Yohanes, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, told TIME Weekly in a somber voice.
"I saw he was dead ... I kissed him."
The Papuan police inspector general, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers were merely "securing" the station under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten us with death," said Papuan police press officer, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many escaped injury.
News of the murders swept through the Jakarta media the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi delivered an impassioned speech in Jayapura, expressing his sympathy for the victims' families and promising to address the violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never be repeated," he said.
National Security Minister Wiranto announced in October 2016 that he would introduce an extra-judicial mechanism to resolve past acts of violence.
Almost immediately, however, there were excuses.
"Most acts of violence took place long ago.
Some of these occurred in the 1990s and some in the early 21st century.
What I mean is that we are determined to punish these acts of violence, but it will not be an easy task," he said.
But in a June 5 interview with TIME, held in Jakarta, Wiranto maintained that he did not plan to impose any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said, "all cases will come before the court."
Wiranto, who has been accused by the UN of "crimes against humanity" on the basis of more than one thousand deaths during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor - said that 11 human rights violations in Papua have been settled so far, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims of the Paniai shooting greeted his claim with incredulity.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but I haven't seen anything yet," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
Years later, he says, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," as he claims.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many Paniai residents who are afraid to talk about the incident.
In his words, he was beaten by members of the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After the bodies were buried, the army started looking for me," he said.
And the shooting still hasn't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired on villagers in neighboring Deiyai.
The scuffle, which left one person dead and 17 others injured, took place between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to provide assistance in transporting an unconscious man to hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24), who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the company building.
According to police, the villagers threw rocks at the members, and the response was a warning shot.
But locals claim that a mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) opened fire on the crowd, killing one person.
"There was panic, we were afraid of retribution," said 29-year-old Dominggu Badii to TIME, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the wounded.
"I didn't leave the house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament demanded the punishment of the police officers involved and the withdrawal of the mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the side of the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of the indigenous people of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes who live in the central highlands.
Many joined the Movement for the Liberation of Papuai (OPM) - an army of rebels that protects the rights of Papuans by attacking and kidnapping Indonesian police officers.
Some of OPM's leaders are from Paniai, among them not Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks, the military has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of Paniaan residents in recent years, all under the pretext of "securing national sovereignty."
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known among Papuai residents as a "tragic and forgotten place."
Poverty fuels the fire.
What little rice is sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
And bread is just as unattainable.
The people here grow their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruit and leafy vegetables.
There are women working in the fields, each cultivating four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is for family use, with the rest sold at the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potato cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire airport opened more air routes and new immigrants began pouring into the country, there has been an increase in economic inequality between native Papuans and immigrants.
Already few jobs are typically filled by more educated and wealthier immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the necessary capital and education to go into business.
"Young people are moving out of villages because of a lack of job opportunities and money," said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Because of the isolation, Papua Province is hidden from the world.
Strict rules for foreign journalists also contribute to this.
At the beginning of this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - were expelled from papua because of a "lack of cooperation with the authorities," all despite the fact that they had been given such rare permission to film.
In his election campaign, Phelim Kine, deputy director of the Asia branch of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi promised to abolish strict rules on journalists and achieve transparency and development, but this never happened.
"Foreign journalists working in the rebellious easternmost regions of Papua and West Papua are at great risk: non-recognition of visas and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of reporting by foreign journalists means that international pressure on Indonesia's Papua case is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread acts of violence" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have also supported OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir shrugged off the accusation, telling reporters in Jakarta that: "There is still a democratic system in place in Indonesia and the media are free, so it is difficult to disguise evidence of human rights violations."
Local people are calling for foreign governments to be involved.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapurau on May 4, local people cheered the slogan "we want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another election scheduled for 2019, but the Papuans say they will not vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions but is surrounded by people associated with the shooting in Paniai," said Gobau, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai - apart from living in constant fear of a robbing army - are wallowing in poverty, poor education and a health system.
Gobai argues that the people of Paniai, like other Papuans, see their vote as a "debt" that must be repaid by Jokowi.
"They don't want money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Panai shooting continue their latest symbolic act of defiance: burying the bodies of the victims on land opposite a police and army station.
Knowing that justice will never be served, at least he will not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus said, his head bowed.
"What can we do?"

Survey results show that more than one in five passengers to the US carry prohibited items on board an aircraft
A passenger survey showed that more than 20 percent knowingly or unknowingly carried prohibited items through a U.S. government agency Transportation Security Administration checkpoint aboard an aircraft, with at least six percent of passengers boarding the aircraft with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers say they belatedly discovered they were traveling with a firearm, ammunition or explosive.
The results of a survey conducted by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - to which more than 1,000 respondents responded - showed that younger passengers were more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to having attempted to knowingly travel with an object that is prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent of passengers with several thousand hours were passengers compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
Food and alcohol are among the most common items that have escaped TSA notice.
More than three per cent of respondents knowingly said a sharp object through security, while 2.2 per cent of women surveyed and 3.7 per cent of men surveyed also admitted to deliberately bringing prohibited drugs on board an aircraft.
The company said it conducted research among passengers worldwide to determine how many accidentally carried unauthorized items through airport security and how many did so on purpose.
Unsurprisingly, most people who have transferred unauthorised objects - whether consciously or unconsciously - travel by plane very often.
As the company has stressed, the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.

EPA head Scott Pruitt on delaying the Obama administration's planned emissions reduction directives
After the Environmental Protection Agency was sued by 15 states, its chief, Scott Pruitt, revoked his earlier decision to delay implementation of the former Obama administration's plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt has introduced changes as part of his plan, responding more quickly than previous administrations to the needs of state environmental regulators.
But he did not mention a legal challenge brought against his previous position before a federal appeals court.
This relates to the latest deadline, which was set at 1 October, when states should start implementing the 2015 regulation to reduce ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the agreement for one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid "interference with local decisions or impending economic growth."
Pruitt, who held the position of Oklahoma's state attorney general before being installed as EPA chief by President Donald Trump, has long served as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since settling in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or delayed regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
The abrupt reversal Wednesday is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that an EPA enforcer overstepped his authority in an effort to delay the inclusion of an Obama administration plan that required oil and gas companies to reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued Wednesday night, Pruitt proposed his version of the ozone standards and strengthened the EPA's commitment to working with states through comprehensive processes and meeting new standards within a given time frame.
"Under the previous administration, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and waited to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing to a settlement and further scheduling," said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous position.
"We don't believe in regulation through litigation, and we take meeting the deadline seriously.
We never joke about our status and the authority it implies."

Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive rewrite of the ozone rules.

The measures still haven't passed the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who headed the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group does not intend to allow in a legal push.
"The reversal of the EPA's views - following our lawsuit - is an important victory for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by air pollution," Schneiderman added.
New York was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.

You never know what might happen to you.
One minute you're home with your family and you're laughing, the next, your whole life suddenly changes from the ground up.
And the worst part is there's absolutely nothing you can do about it.
A similar fate befell Andreas Christopheros of Great Britain, whose face was laced with acid by an unknown assailant, who was eventually acquitted.
Reuters website reported the information.
In December 2014, there was a knock at the Christopheroses' door.
Andreas got up to answer the door.
He figured there was probably a courier at the door to deliver Christmas gifts to the family that day.
Instead, a cruel surprise awaited him.
The man he'd never seen before in his life poured acid over him right after opening without warning, saying, "That's for you, buddy."
The pain was indescribable.
My clothes disintegrated on me like nothing, and all I felt was incredible pain on my skin," said Andreas.
His family rushed him to the hospital, but there his loved ones were told the terrible news - according to doctors, he had no chance of surviving.
For weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly afraid that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Ninety percent of it was the face that the doctors were trying to put together using skin from other parts of the patient's body.
A major complication for Christopheros was the loss of her eyelids.
It's probably the most excruciating thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide from the unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he said, describing his torment.
Today, Christopheros has had twelve surgeries that are far from his last.
Accidents suffered by victims of acid attacks can require hundreds of surgical procedures and years of treatment, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after intensive and long-term treatment, victims have tissue scarred for life.
"Sometimes people do not recover and struggle against deformity and deformity throughout their lives," said Professor Peter Dziewulski, spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker made a mistake.
As for the attack, Christopheros is sure the unknown man must have mistaken him for someone else.
The perpetrator believed he was taking revenge on a man who had sexually abused a close person.
The police investigated the case thoroughly and eventually tracked down the attacker.
The man was originally sentenced to a minimum of eight years in prison.
However, later, to the astonishment of the Christopheros family, the verdict changed fundamentally.
"The three judges ultimately concluded that the sentence should be lifted as the man is not considered a threat to the public," said Christopheros.
Over the last few years, infestations from corrosive substances have increased considerably.
The country's interior ministry has commented on the issue by planning to set new guidelines for prosecutors on the classification of corrosives.

But the victims of such attacks are not about to give up.
They are calling for the UK government to impose tougher and longer prison sentences on people who attack their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also call for tighter controls on the sale of dangerous substances, which are often commonly available in different shops, as they are different cleaners.

In the largest city in the United Arab Emirates, Dubai, the famous skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the largest residential buildings in the world, burned at night.

According to a spokesman for Dubai police, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread upwards.

Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
They measured 38.3 degrees Celsius on Hodoninsk.
Tuesday's temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained at the top for only two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsius recorded in Strážnice, Hodonínsko, Thursday topped it, making it the hottest day so far this year.
This has been confirmed by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
Compared to Tuesday, however, there were not many temperature records on Thursday.
On Tuesday, records were broken or set for 35 of 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded record-breaking temperatures.
Perhaps in Strážnice, Thursday's temperature was the same as the previous record from 2013.
In Lednice, Břeclavsk, Thursday's 37.4 degrees surpassed the original maximum by four tenths of a degree, and in Pohořelice, Brno, the current 37.1 degrees surpassed the record by three tenths.
Both records, as with Strážnice, dated from 2013.
It was ten degrees lower in the west.
High temperatures appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia on Thursday.
After Strážnice, the biggest heat was in Dyjákovice on Znojemsk and Broda nad Dyji on Břeclavsk, where the mercury consistently climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not break the record.
By contrast, in western and northwestern Bohemia, for example, Thursday's highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees Celsius, according to the WHM website.
"Temperatures didn't start to rise there until later this afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually diminish, according to ČHMÚ, and there could be more significant rains on Sunday.
But in most parts of Moravia, temperatures will remain high on Friday and in the south-east of Moravia on Saturday.
China lacks tourists.
Beijing is losing billions over visa policy.
For decades, China has tried to exert its influence without the use of force.
It spends $10 billion a year on promoting language schools and building universities abroad, pushing its entertainment industry into foreign markets and trying to attract Western tourists.
But Beijing is failing to do so.
The country's state media talk of a plan to make tourism a driving force for economic change and modernization.
But the number of arrivals grew by only 3.8 percent last year, and roughly 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
This is due, among other things, to the fact that, despite all its global aspirations, China does not exactly welcome foreigners with open arms, the situation in the world's most populous country is assessed by Peking University economics professor Christopher Balding in an article for Bloomberg.
China's visa policy is an example that speaks volumes.
Only 13 countries have visa-free travel with China; the citizens of the others have to process their visas in advance.
At Chinese offices in the US, the crowds are therefore comparable to Chinese New Year celebrations.
A visa costs $140, but if you don't want to wait long hours in line, you have to pay $100 or more for additional services.
Such restrictions erect significant economic barriers.
A study by the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for a visa reduces a country's visitor numbers by 70 percent.
Only two million Americans visited mainland China in 2015, while 1.8 million Americans visited Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China's gross domestic product and has less than one percent of its population.
China often exacerbates the problem itself by using tourism to achieve its policy goals, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China cut traffic to South Korea in the spring amid a rift over South Korea's anti-missile system, the South Koreans hit back, avoiding China.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 percent year-on-year, while Japan saw an increase of 85 percent.
All this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recently published report by the US Federal Reserve, as much as $190 billion may have left China as a result of Chinese foreign travel, while China receives about $35 billion annually in currency sales to incoming tourists.
According to official balance of payments figures, China had a $217 billion deficit in tourism last year, equal to 44 percent of China's total surplus in trade in goods.
So the small number of tourists deals a very painful blow to a country that is anxiously preventing capital flight.
But the factors listed above are only one manifestation of a more general reticence toward outsiders.
In many parts of China, immigrants have been virtually unheard of.
As recently as 2013, there were fewer than a million foreigners across China.
Some individual cities have more in the United States.
Even Japan, which is not exactly a crossroads of immigration, has double that.
Meanwhile, many scientific papers show that immigrants tend to revive economic growth, entrepreneurship, and innovation.
But they are virtually impossible to find in China.
Solving these problems will be politically challenging, but the step at hand is to simplify the visa apparatus.
Other Asian states, notably India and Vietnam, have recently made great efforts to make visa procedures simpler and cheaper.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currency, it should be easier for them to get there.

Tusk testified again at the prosecutor's office about Smolensk.
"He has something to fear," the dead president's brother, the president of PiS's governing Law and Justice party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, said in Tusk's address.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczynski will not intimidate me," Tusk replied, accusing the country's current leadership of trying to abuse the judiciary against political rivals.
As he left the headquarters of the Prosecutor's Office, a crowd was waiting for Tusk, according to TVN 24, chanting Donald Tusk! and wishing the politician One Hundred Years!.
Tusk thanked the support and assured that his conscience was clear: "I have nothing to fear, and Kaczynski will not intimidate me."

He added that any conflict with Russia would ruin Tusk's chances of winning the most important seat in the union, of which Poland has absolutely nothing.
At the same time, Kaczynski said he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that things could turn out differently with Donald Tusk, but she did not take note.
Tusk underwent an eight-hour interrogation at the prosecutor's office earlier on April 19.
Even then, he didn't testify as a suspect, only as a witness.
Nevertheless, many saw his summons for questioning as part of an obvious effort by the Polish government and PiS chief Kaczynski to discredit Tusk as a political rival by linking him to various scandals.
In Poland, the Public Prosecution Service is subordinate to the Minister for Justice, who fulfils the role of Prosecutor-General.
The summons for questioning came soon after the election of Tusk as head of the European Council, whom Kaczynski tried hard but in vain to prevent, including during Merkel's visit to Warsaw.
In the end, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo protested alone at the EU summit against the extension of Tusk's mandate.

Moore's Ford Bridge massacre: activists commemorate racist lynching
A 1948 Ford Mercury passed bystanders in Monroe, Georgia, and lurched toward Moore's Ford Bridge.
But before the car, carrying four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked its way.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - took a long drag on his cigarette and stared at the windshield of the automobile.
Inside, the passengers trembled with fear.
"We want that n---a Roger!" the man yelled.
"Bring it to me!"
The silence is broken by the roar of a young black man being pulled from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is merely a reconstruction of the events that occurred on July 22.
But when one of the men throws a noose over "Roger's" neck, the audience sighs with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists have been returning regularly to Moore's Ford Bridge, reconstructing the fateful night in 1946 when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by Kukluxklan members.
No one has ever been tried for the murders.
"It's surprising that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identities," said Tyrone Brooks, who is helping to organize the reconstruction of the event.
"It's a stain on our history and a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia congressman and lifelong civil rights campaigner.
In his eyes, the reenactment of the event represents a dramatic call to action, reminding the community of Monroe each year that justice has not been served.
"We demand prosecution and closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice above all," said Brooks.
"Until then, the process of healing and reconciliation cannot begin."
A medical examiner covers one of the bodies of the victims of the Moore's Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were expected to participate in the lynching.
But no one has yet been prosecuted.
Despite suspects remaining at large for decades, civil rights supporters argue that both reasons for lynching - politics and sex - were known to all residents of the city.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision gave Georgia's black residents the right to participate for the first time ever in an election that had been scheduled for the summer.
And it was during the summer election season, according to the FBI, that black farmer Roger Malcom was supposed to stab white landowner Barnett Hester during a scuffle - allegedly over his wife.
In town, according to Brooks, it was said that Hester had made love to Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and got her pregnant.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, then-prominent white landowner Loy Harrison posted $600 bail for Malcom.
He was accompanied to the prison by Dorothy and cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
On their return from the prison, just before the entrance to Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects blocked their way.
“As it turns out, the murders were planned and orchestrated by Harrison,” the FBI concluded.
"It is also clear that there was collusion between state and local law enforcement officials who not only participated in the lynching, but also disposed of evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks was more succinct about the matter.
"It was a massacre over the right to vote," he said.
"The murders had a clear subtext for all black locals: 'this is what you get if you register and vote'."
The annual reconstruction of the Moore's Ford Bridge event has been organized by Cassandra Greene for nearly a decade.
Her performance is figurative, engaging, and apt, showing a deep-seated racism that many would like to think extinct in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction isn't easy, and it's even more difficult to look away, but Greene says it makes sense.
"No one wants to talk about lynching because in doing so we have to face the uncomfortable feelings that lurk within each of us," Greene said.
"But there can be no relationship between us unless you listen to what I've been through."
The main rehearsals for this year's reenactment began in June, and on the first day, approximately 30 actors - a dozen white, the rest black - crowded into a room where Greene introduced them to a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is acting assistant director.
He played the leader of the Kukluxklan for many years, but in his words, the role is exhausting.
"I have a bad feeling about this because it contradicts who I am," Marbaugh said.
"I think it's very important to remember that part of history regularly, because we never want to go back to that time."
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play the role of Roger Malcom and, by extension, Barnett Hester, rehearse their roles.
The show begins with a scuffle - Malcom arguing with Hester and blaming him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get off my f---ing property!"
You can't take Rascon.
There's a scuffle.
At that moment, everyone (every black actor, anyway) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs the most.
"What happened?" he asks Rascon.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," Greene says cheerfully.
"I just don't think white people said 'n-r' in that tone back then."
"Exactly," one of the black actors blurts.
"You have to put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; hostility replaces a sense of rapprochement.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic, if only for it to be done for enough of the four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
This time, Rascona emphasizes the correct pronouncement of the N word.
Nobody's laughing now.
The show ends violently and quickly.
The screams, the gunshots... and the silence.
A woman dressed in black stands over the bodies of the actors and sings a mournful Billie Holiday song, "Strange Fruit."
There's a sadness in the room with every word.
Against the background of all this, a dozen or so onlookers wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
There are virtually equal numbers of blacks and whites in the audience.
One couple traveled all the way from Ithaca, New York, many of the onlookers from nearby.
They each endure the local humid climate for nearly eight hours, and Brooks leads them in line to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until now, the murders may have been viewed with detachment, but now, standing in the same spot where the lynching took place, the atmosphere is eerie.
With the last words of the song, Greene invites a crowd of onlookers to inspect the bodies.
The children kneel by the heads of the victims, watching the fake blood and the still bodies and whispering in their ears.
"They're not dead," the little boy says.
A few minutes go by and Greene thanks the audience.
The actors are cleaning the rope and wiping away tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the leader of the Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascona hugs his two actor friends and bursts into tears in their arms; emotion finally comes over him.
"It's all right," whispers one of the women.
"We know you abhor the role.
But you had a reason."
Later that same day, the audience sits down with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young Caucasian couple talks with enthusiasm about a show with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski could barely find the words to express her feeling about tonight's performance.
"It's difficult to listen to those nasty words and look at the hideous deeds . . . done by people who look like you and do it because they look like you," she told the reenactment.
"It makes me realize that lynching is still an issue," she added, "it's just called police skirmishes."
Across the room, Tyrone Brooks is sitting in a courtroom, enjoying his dinner while talking about civil rights.
By his own account, he had already begun planning the show for the next year.
"The reconstruction of these events is inspiring, as it describes the fear we must have experienced - but it is also a moment for reflection," he said.
"If we don't learn from this, who knows . . . it could happen again.
People who do not know and study the history of their country are doomed to repeat it."

I love the instructions.
A friend of mine says only a coward reads the instructions.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It is one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
I am nostalgic for a time gone by, where instructions to use anything were more of a rarefied phenomenon.
For example, my first gramophone contained only one piece of paper, on which were hieroglyphics depicting the wiring of some parts, all with some secret markings.
Years later, when something inside me went wrong, I offered the paper to a shaman who wasn't afraid to unscrew the backboard.
Grimacing, he told me what the labyrinthine paper was for.
Yes, it was a habitual aid to chronic depredations of toilet paper.
He playfully found the disconnected wire and allowed me to listen to the expensive vinyl plaques again.
A new age has brought new guides.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where a sliced grapefruit was simply held, required about ten pictures.
Of particular note was a sketch describing how to insert one piece into another.
The set was a two-piece, and there was just no other way.
Giving it the other way required considerable effort, with the necessity of breaking off certain plastic components.
My disdain for instructions ended up with my Seat Leon self-propelled.
The year 2003 still had such a book with instructions for minor repairs, which included replacing the light bulb with a blinker.
It was simple.
Three steps in all, and the work was to be done.
Unfortunately, the author of the manual neglected to mention that while the light bulb on the right was really only changed in three steps.
1. remove the cap.
2. screw out a cracked light bulb and screw in a new one.
3rd insert cover.
The light bulb on the left had a problem with the location of the battery housing.
At first I thought that by inserting my right upper limb into the bowels of the car I would find a spring, a screw, by which I could easily remove the cover and then follow the points of the 1-3 economical author of the service book.
Causeway error.
The shelter had no room, no room for the slender hand of Cinderella, let alone an obese Silesian.
I've wasted half an hour of my life with no success whatsoever.
The condition was exacerbated by my wife's entrance to the garage, which was prompted by a scream and words she hears from my mouth quite exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?" she asked guilelessly.
My reply lasted about 90 seconds, however if I omit the vulgar terms there are only two publishable words left.
Changing the bulb.
"What's taking you so long?" she hazarded in what could be her last sentence in a long-lasting union.
Slowly I explained the problem, placing the main emphasis on the method of torturing the author of the manual, where the ingestion of hot iron on the hand that wrote the manual, then its wiping, so that he could never write again, was merely an introduction to the Hammer's wide range of instructions for witches, including his commission burning at the top of Losin Castle.
"How about removing the box?" the woman said, meaning removing the battery.
In sheer desperation it happened, and after that step 1-3 was as easy and quick as the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
That was until the day I got a call from a colleague who was just coming out of a collapse after a check-up with two female officers of the National Drug Enforcement Administration.
I know him as a level-headed colleague who has experienced the possible and the impossible in the field, and who can tell even wild stories in a dispassionate voice.
"Imagine I got a ticket for not posting my hand-washing instructions," he told me in a weak voice.
I got the whole problem out of him, which was that he didn't have a pictorial guide on how to wash his hands over the sink in the patients' bathroom.
His argument to the commissioner that adults are generally good at washing their hands, and that the need for pictograms to handle the habitual activity of decent people, had no healing effect and cost him a good deal of money.
'It's not just that,' she told him.
He had come to understand that simply rinsing soapy palms with running water was a primitive act on the level of the Cro-Magnon, that a modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performed the ceremony in ten steps.
So perhaps it is necessary to convey the need to release water from the tap.
The process has a total of eleven points, but at the end it's a joyous realization that you've washed your hands exactly as the SÚKL hosudar orders you to.
Finally, I must point out that I have been inspired and am preparing a detailed plan for the toilet activity.
On defecation, the procedure is uniform, there will be no problem, for urination, due to certain gender differences, it will be necessary to post instructions two.
The problem remains those pictograms, for to create a perfect procedure also involves a precise drawing of all the anatomical details, which might cause a certain amount of outrage to the prudish visitor to the toilet, despite the fact that he may at last learn that he has been wiping the relevant opening with a wholly flawed process throughout his life.
Pearson lays off 3,000 more workers and cuts dividend in bid to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would lay off an additional 3,000 employees and cut the interim dividend by 72 percent in response to another restructuring programme to change the business model.

Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldiers killed in suicide blast
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others, officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded, the NATO statement said.
Unofficial reports say three civilians also died in the attack in the city's Qarabagh district.
A bombing hit Afghanistan earlier this month - more than 30 people were killed in an explosion at a Herat mosque on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said in its comments that Tuesday's explosion occurred after a patrol, along with members of the Afghan army, was attacked by a "local person with a homemade explosive device."
The statement goes on to say that all wounded soldiers are out of harm's way and are in a US military hospital at Bagram Air Base.
According to the reports, the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh area is a major source of concern for NATO-allied forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% of the victims died in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in Kabul's Shia district.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
On May 31, a major explosion killed more than 150 people in the city center, the deadliest militant attack in the country since U.S. troops overthrew the Taliban government in 2001.
Violence is undermining the already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops to assist the country's military units and police officers.
According to the rapporteurs, the suicide attacks that have dogged public confidence in the government in recent weeks have shaken its regulations and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghanín's reputation.
EPA reconsidered its decision to delay smoking rules in response to lawsuit
The US Environmental Protection Agency has revoked its decision to delay an Obama administration law that mandated states to reduce emissions, just one day after 15 states sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision on the referral of the "Ozone Standards 2015" in the wee hours of Wednesday night, saying it was presenting the Agency's commitment to work with the states.
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and will hear their views," EPA Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced an EPA effort to delay ozone standards - which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and, based on measurements, determine limits that must be met by October 2018.
A group of 15 from most Democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed suit Tuesday, arguing that the EPA's actions were illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration aims to avoid many of the environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - in Trump's words, in an effort to kick-start economic growth.
But the new government's efforts have launched countermeasures from Democrats and conservative groups concerned about the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA states on its website that breathing air containing ozone "may decrease lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.

After Garcia's unanimous decision victory against former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday's bout on Showtime, both fighters made the list of the top five lightweight boxers.
Garcia extended his right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck."
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN at 7:00 p.m. on Saturday.
Boxers pose for photographers, and Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas adds that a potential fight between boxers would be a "perfect test."
"I'm a former featherweight champion," adds Garcia.
"I had to put on weight to fight Broner (67kg), but I'm not that big.
I'm small for my 63 kg.
I would like to return to the lightweight category.
Lomachenko has to gain weight again to get lightweight... then we can fight.
That's what the fans want.
Why not give them that?"
Lomachenko agrees.
"Boxing would benefit from this fight."
Klimas has made a demand for pay-per-view - part of his strategy. Lomachenko should make his lightweight debut at the end of this year and face Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) next year, who has also expressed an interest in a bout against the winner of Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who will meet on September 23 for the lightweight title at the Forum Arena.
"The game should be a pay-per-view style, that's what the fans demand," said Garcia, who later commented that he was open to the possibility of broadcasting the game through the television station that comes up with the best offer.
"We are the main attraction.
No one else is going to draw that kind of attention.
We'll wait for the right opportunity ..."
Garcia said he recognized Lomachenko as an "amazing boxer" and could attend his fight Saturday.
But Lomachenko was not to be lulled by Garcia's praise, saying that the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow... sorry, Mike, but you're asking for a knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then boxing.
Both boxers said they felt rising tension ahead of each other's duel.
"You don't just forget this game.
No other match draws this much attention.
And I will be happy to stoke the fire," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best fighters, and this is Mikey."
It's going to be a great game."

Latest test results to set age limit for asylum applications in Sweden
The latest test results of asylum seekers in Sweden who were subjected to a new method assessing their age show that over 80 percent of people were questioned as being over 18, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (RÃ¤ttsmedicinalverket) began conducting the new tests at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is to assess applicants more accurately as part of the evaluation of asylum applications. The measure was taken after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for its failure to determine the correct age of some refugees who had lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has referred 6880 cases for investigation and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2481 tests, carried out between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
80 per cent (2002) were judged to be over 18 years of age, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency judged that the interviewee was "possibly over 18 years of age."
In a further 423 cases, it was decided that the interviewee was "possibly under 18 years of age."
Tests are only accessed when the age of the interviewee is questionable.
According to Johan GÃ¶ransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
"Compared to last month, the statistics remain business as usual and the figures are very similar," he told The Local.
The higher number of applicants, estimated to be over 18, does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers are lying about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests, stating that in 442 cases the person interviewed was found to be 18 years of age or older.
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the interviewee said he would be 18 this year.
There has also been criticism of the medical age-determination method, which involves an X-ray of wisdom teeth and an MRI scan of knee joints, which is then assessed by dentists and X-rays.
One skeptic is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who is involved, among other things, in assessing people's biological maturity to determine the age at which they went through puberty.
"I've had reason to think about this issue, and I don't think these types of age-assessment measurements are right.
In a sense, judging biological age is highly uncertain.
If we cannot determine age accurately, we should not pretend otherwise," Metro said.
The Forensic Medical Agency's GÃ¶ransson defended the decision, saying: "In general, the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is that the interviewee is just under the age of 18, which in this case is equivalent to 10 per cent of all interviewees.’
Trump threatened the president of Mexico on the phone.
In a call to Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto in January, US President Donald Trump threatened not to meet with him if he publicly said his country would not pay to build a wall between the US and Mexico.
Trump said in the interview that the funding would somehow be arranged, though he acknowledged that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Trump has been similarly outspoken with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This is apparent from transcripts of interviews published by The Washington Post on Thursday.
Trump made the construction of a wall on the southern border with Mexican money one of the main promises in his election campaign last year.
In his first interview with Mexico's president shortly after taking office, Trump undiplomatically chastised Peña Nieto for being critical of his plan to build a wall.
He portrayed the southern neighbor as a growing political problem and pushed the Mexican president not to say publicly that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't say that to the press," Trump said repeatedly in a January 27 interview, threatening to cut ties with the Mexican president if he continued to make defiant statements.
Funding would work out, he said, and it would work out in the end.
"But if you're going to say that Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to see you gentlemen anymore, because that's unacceptable to me," Trump said, according to the American Journal.
He called the wall the least important thing we're talking about, but politically, it may be the most important.
Trump issued the executive order to build the wall shortly after taking power.
Mexico rejects both the construction and financing of the 3,200-mile wall, which has also escalated relations between the two countries.
In late March, Trump said the project would be paid for by the United States so far.
Trump eventually met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the G20 summit in Hamburg in July.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump's January 28 phone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull.
The White House chief of staff described the conversation as ridiculous.
That conclusion was prompted by an exchange of views on a deal under which Australia would grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States accepting people from internment facilities in Pacific island nations.
Trump at first thought the deal was dumb, but later went along with it.
"I'm sure you can say this isn't the deal you made, but you're going to have to stick to it," Turnbull told Trump.
In some passages, the phone conversation with Turnbull was almost jovial, such as when Trump praised Australia's refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats as a good idea.
"You're worse than me," Trump joked.
But suddenly the tone of the conversation sharpened.
"I hate receiving these people," Trump observed.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in jail now.
"They won't be great people to go work for the local milkmen," he said.
He also noted in the interview that the fugitive could become the Boston bomber in five years.
Trump held telephone conversations with a number of world statesmen at the end of January, about a week after arriving at the White House, often several in one day.
In the end, he called the conversation with Turnbull the least pleasant of the day.
Before ending it, he pointed out that he had previously had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
They executed Rana's killer in front of a mob.
Her father watched, too.
The execution took place in a square in Yemen's capital, Sana.
Mohammed al-Maghrabi chose the tiny Rana Almatari who lived in his neighbourhood as his victim.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took her to his father's house, where he raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
He then raped her body, which he then dumped near the mosque.
The violent death of a little girl has affected an entire country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the front row of a thousand-strong crowd that had gathered to witness the execution.
Mohammed al Maghrabi was sentenced under Sharia law.
The victim's father made his feelings known to the media after the execution.
I feel reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's a new day in my life.
Other members of the family were also present, shouting the slogan "long live justice" along with the crowd.
The rapist was brought to the square by a police van from which he was dragged.
The cops tied him up on his stomach.
One of the officers turned his weapon on him and opened fire at point-blank range.
The crowd in attendance celebrated every shot that was fired.
Mr al Almatari told the MailOnline website that justice had been done in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah and Sharia law have won," he added.
I stood in Sana's Freedom Square, awaiting the execution of my daughter's killer.
After that, my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Rana's tiny body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
My wife Jamileh and I are grateful that justice has been done.
Police feared the crowd gathered in the square would descend into a hateful frenzy, snatching the killer and lynching him.
The execution was ordered by a court under the authority of the Shiite Houthis.
Initially, however, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 lashes as soon as he was arrested, but his actions aroused such outrage that the judge opted for the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl's disappearance on June 27.
Rana's family knew him well.
When police searched the basement of his home, they discovered evidence that the man had planned his actions.
Mr. Almatari described him as a monster.
What could be his motive?
Even an animal would be more merciful to Rana.
"Our family has no enemies, and the injuries Rana's body sustained were horrific," he told the media.
"Rana disappeared in the afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspapers and all our TV stations, posters with her picture all over them," he continued.
Everyone believes the police received a tip from the killer's parents, who suspected their son of the gruesome crime.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after learning her daughter's body had been found.
Rana used to go out and play with the other kids from the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went out to see where he was.
We looked everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around, but we searched in vain.
The people of Yemen were disgusted by the crime and began to gather outside the police station where al Maghrabi was being held and demand immediate punishment.
A DOJ representative read a recording of the investigation to the crowd present to reassure them.
The accused appeared to show no remorse for his actions.
Just before the sentence was served, the officers read him the sentence, but the convict only glanced at his executioner.
The entire event was filmed for national television, but many of the crowd's recordings appeared online.
West Virginia governor announces change of political party
On Thursday night, West Virginia's Democratic governor, Jim Justice, announced at President Trump's rally that he was switching sides.
"Like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me," said Governor Justice.
"Today, after much prayer and deliberation, I tell you... today, as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer support you as a Democratic governor."
The crowd of onlookers erupted in joy.
"I'm signing up with the Republicans tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a coach, I can tell you it's time to jump into another game."
Trump had earlier promised people at a rally in West Virginia an important announcement.
Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes magazine is the only billionaire in the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large fortune from his father and owns several coal mines.
The value of his estate is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night that said, "The defection of Governor Justice is yet another blow to the Democratic Party, putting obstacles in our way rather than helping to elevate our country."
"For a Democratic party that has only 15 governors and controls the fewest legislative bodies in history, Governor Justice's announcement is the final straw for an already miserable, leaderless party that has struggled in vain to find a positive and unifying message," RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in her statement to CBS News.

Sebastian Coe praises Russia's 'sincere' apology for doping scandal
Former outstanding athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for its sincere apology for the doping scandal, but reiterated that the time is not yet right for Russia's return to the sporting world.
The head of Russian athletics, Dmitry Shylakhtin, told an IAAF congress - held on the eve of the WOC in athletics - that his country's expulsion from the world of sport was the right thing to do and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to "all the athletes who lost their gold and silver medals that way."
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban, which came into force in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) showed that Russia had encouraged doping by its athletes.
"I think we have seen a very frank response and presentation today," said IAAF President Sebastian Coe.
"All members of the council and congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia admitted its mistake and is working hard to correct and restore the proper functioning of the entire federation."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia had adopted criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think today has gone very well and we have progressed to the next level, but congress supports the recommendation of the emergency staff to maintain the sentence that has been imposed on Russia," Coe added.
"We must do everything in the next few months to stabilise the situation.

The state contract CzechTrade was awarded to František Savov, whose state is prosecuting.
František Savova's Mladá fronta publisher won the public contract from the state pro-export agency CzechTrade.
Officials gave him a hundred percent of the points in all quality criteria.
They didn't mind that the Czech state prosecuted Savov for tax fraud and demanded his extradition to the Czech Republic.
The pro-export agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, CzechTrade, launched a four-year contract in April to provide editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
The contract, worth a total of CZK 30.8 million, was awarded to the publisher Mladá fronta podnikatele František Savova.
Meanwhile, Czech police already charged him with tax evasion in 2014 and are pursuing him on the run.
Savov has fled to the UK and the Czech Republic is requesting his extradition.
The case was brought to the attention of Aktuálně.cz.
According to the original CzechTrade criteria, the award was to be decided 60 percent by the price offered and the remaining 40 by a beauty contest, the quality of the project.
Savov's company was greatly helped by the latter criterion.
According to information from Dotyk.cz, she received one hundred points in all quality sub-criteria.
This, in effect, put it ahead of the next candidate, Vltava Labe Media VLM, which offered a better price in the process.
While Mladá fronta operated at CZK 404,900 per month, VLM offered CZK 324,350.
Unlike Young Front, however, it scored below average in all quality criteria, with a total of 62 points.
The tender was also attended by consultant firm BDO Advisory and digital agency R-Media, which, like Aktuálně.cz, is under the publishing house Economia.
The publisher of the VLM has lodged several objections to the outcome of the tender, saying that it considers its evaluation unfair and insufficiently reasoned.
Following their rejection, it decided to contest the competition with the Office for the Protection of Competition.
He believes that CzechTrade acted in violation of the law.
"The appellant is convinced that the contracting authority arrived at the decision to select the contractor of the contract on the basis of a purely subjective evaluation, clearly favouring the participant Mladá fronta, a.s., at the expense of the appellant and other contractors," reads the application to initiate proceedings filed at the OBR this week, published by the Aktuálně website.
According to the CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the VLM Michal Klíma, the scoring of the selection committee seems implausible and a 100% evaluation of the Young Front project by all its members is extremely suspicious.
"Any independent observer must consider such a miraculous success by one of the competitors unlikely and suspicious," he said to Aktuálně Klíma.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
In principle, CzechTrade does not comment on public contracts before they are concluded.
All information about the contract you mentioned is published in the Contracting Authority Profile and Public Procurement Bulletin in accordance with the law.
"A full written report will be published after the conclusion of the contract, but we cannot comment on its progress during the duration of the contract," said the agency's media representative, Štěpán Dlouhý, to Dotyk.cz.
The young front responded by stating that they considered it extremely problematic that the publisher Economia intervened with an article in Aktuálně.cz in a competition where it has its own business interests.
However, that fact was mentioned in that article.
What might have helped in the tenor was that she had provided editorial services to BusinessInfo over the previous four years.
It first competed the contract in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade was led by Martim Kuba ODS.
František Savov is accused by the police of tax evasion in connection with his companies' excess VAT deductions, which caused the alleged damage of up to CZK 770 million to the Czech state.
The Czech Republic has been asking the UK to publish it since 2014.
According to Savov, the head of the YES movement, Andrej Babiš, is behind its criminalisation, under the influence of Mafra.
Last year, a London court rejected Savov's appeal against extradition, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not progressed since last year, we have not received any notification from Great Britain regarding the acquisition of the legal force of the judgment to date," Prague City Prosecutor's Office spokesperson Štěpánka Zenklová told Aktuálně.cz.
In addition to owning Mladá fronta, Savov featured in the Cyprus-based firm Harvestor Limited, which controlled the Cheshire-based brewery Samson, and in the Cypriot company Maraflex, which is billed as an investment fund, buying distressed assets.
He should also control the bankrupt company Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which owes over CZK 3 billion.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the expulsion of assets from the former Socialist Youth League.

How football's financial rules will affect Neymar's move to Paris
Rules restricting the financing of European football clubs will do nothing to disrupt Neymar's record transfer from Barcelona, Spain, to Paris-Saint Germain, France.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by the EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League.
The Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules, introduced by UEFA in 2011, stipulate that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transfer was not financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid a sum of EUR 222 million just to buy Neymar out of his contract and Neymar will demand a salary of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
There are several financial terms for Neymar's transfer to France.
Since the PSG team is financed by a wealthy Qatari family who made their fortune in energy sales, they can afford to bring Neymar into an already stellar football family.
Clubs can spend huge sums to buy players, but on the other hand they have to prove legal sources of income, which allows them to cover the overheads of commercial football-related activities.
FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after being installed as UEFA Director in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that went into debt in pursuit of new reinforcements ultimately cheated and risked bankruptcy if banks or owners refused to provide them.
In 2011, the FFP rules redirected their attention from club debt to monitoring their losses.
That change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich used with Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and spending huge sums on players to build a global brand - was suddenly not so advantageous.
Under the current three-year trial period, which ends in 2018, clubs can report a loss of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite Platini having to leave his post in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Cheferin, is determined to advocate a ban on excessive spending.
"The FFP rules are still in place and we are committed to strengthening them in the future," Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP compliance, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid the sum for the redemption of Neymar in a lump sum payment, it may, for accounting purposes, spread the sum over the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be broken down to EUR 44.4 million each year for five years.
The first wave of the highest FFP sanctions hit PSG in 2014, along with Manchester City, which is owned by the Abu Dhabi group.
PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million ($82 million) - which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and an injunction to reduce the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is wary of teams that may attempt to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their revenues through companies associated with club owners.
Therefore, even if the Qatari company sponsors PSG once the financing exceeds the value of the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit billing.
A similar measure was taken by UEFA in 2014 after it decided that the amount of funding provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
Some reports suggest that part of Neymar's income at PSG could be paid from the organising committee for the 2022 football in Qatar.
However, PSG and MS 2022 officials in Qatar denied the fat that Neymat should become an ambassador for MS in football and that such a manoeuvre would be easily detected by UEFY officials.
Previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules,
UEFA has not opened an investigation into the transfer of Neymar to PSG, according to Tuesday's statement from insiders.
The source of this report wished to remain anonymous as he is not authorized to comment on the situation with PSG, The Associated Press reported.
The latest published accounts show that PSG closed 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club promises to increase its turnover by up to 30 per cent by signing the contract.
Apparently concerned about the departure of one of the biggest stars, Spanish league officials sought to thwart Neymar's departure, arguing that PSG would break FFP rules.
"It is a clear case of 'financial doping' by both club and state," said La Liga president Javier Teba to Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the Qatari syndicate's ownership of the PSG club.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sporting tycoon, shares the same La Liga stance on the club's funding.
"It is a consequence of ownership that has fundamentally changed the football world in the last 15 years," Wenger was heard saying on Thursday.
"Anything is possible once the club is owned by the state.
Compliance with financial fair play rules is very difficult because the state may have different interests in the participation of such players in its club."

"Ten years ago, a doctor would have gone to town and taken out a loan (to start a practice)," says James Merritt, president of Merritt, Hawkins & Associates of Irvine, California, the medical recruiter who conducted the survey.
Richard Haskayne, president and chief executive officer of Calgary-based Interhome Energy Inc., Interprovincial's parent company, said the company would prefer to work on a joint proposal with other "stakeholders."
Interface Systems Inc. of Ann Arbor, Michigan, said it would report a drop in net income to $470000, or 11 cents a share, for the fourth quarter ended September 30, from $805000 last year, or 19 cents a share.

We had some chances.
We need to work together as a team and move our game.
Why couldn't Sparta get this far into the match?
The game is awfully busy.
The combinations of the opponent were much better than ours.
We didn't get anywhere, we took one shot at halftime.
Of course, that's an awful lot if you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, we managed to play them in the final third.

An entrepreneur is to serve ten years for extreme tax evasion.
The Constitutional Court rejected a complaint by businessman Jiří Tomano, who is expected to serve a decade in prison for tax evasion on a substantial scale.
The damage quantified is CZK 645 million.
Toman claimed in the complaint that the judiciary violated his fundamental rights, saying the factual findings of the Zlín and Olomouc courts are incomplete.
Constitutional judges, however, called the complaint unfounded, TIME found from the court's database.
The CPS is not another appellate court.
"It cannot, as a fourth instance, assess errors of fact or law allegedly committed by ordinary courts if they do not constitute an infringement of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the order reads.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been final since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the High Court in Olomouc.
At the time, Toman was in extradition custody in Argentina, where he was also, according to the resolution, at the time of the DOJ's decision.
The sentence imposed is at the upper limit of the statutory rate, which according to the verdict is equivalent to the damage suffered.
The High Court described the case as extreme tax evasion, with a macro-economic impact on the state budget.
The man served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of World Servis from 2005 to 2008.
The damage amounted to CZK 645 million between January and July 2008 alone, with total leakage exceeding CZK 1 billion, according to the expert.
For procedural reasons, however, it was no longer possible to try Toman for the full amount.
According to the indictment, World Servis did not include all invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of paying monthly VAT and excise duties amounting to at least tens of millions of crowns, it paid taxes in the hundreds of thousands.

"Summer to Survival" and "Comrade Detective" strike a nostalgic chord
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for both the characters of the famous 1980s; the sordid 1990s (when geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter put a comedy sketch called "The State" on MTV); and, of course, for modern times, namely 2001, before stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, and Paul Rudd fled to bigger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is both a light parody and the embodiment of our modern Facebook era of lasting memories.
From the perspective of the franchise, though, it looks like someone's running out of breath.
The series "First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well - not just because of its absurd humor (an example might be the story of the creation of a talking can of vegetables by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors moved away from the main witty punch line - middle-aged actors playing horny teenagers - and couldn't make fun of previous events.
The sequel "Ten Years Later," in which adults play adults doesn't push the emotional level as much, and the satire is sporadic in places, including a parody of 1990s thrillers like "The Hand on the Cradle."
At one point, the character finds an Apple Powerbook, roller skates, and "a lot of other stuff from 1991" in a pile of junk.
Many major storylines repeat themselves.
The good-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, still hasn't gotten over his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention a crazy plot that involves Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) being egged on by George H. W. Bush (a very well-cast Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the many side stories.
Particularly amusing is watching the ever-young, long-haired Rudd, aka Matt Dillon's character from the film Youth, whose once respectable character Andy is now an old geezer.
The franchise could be triggered by moments of random madness, like the returning "Seven Up" series, until it reaches what I suspect will be a logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," when, in the final scene, the entire group goes on to premiere "Years to Survive."
Meanwhile, "Comrade Detective" on Amazon appeals to another type of nostalgia: the Cold War revivalism of "Such Normal Americans," the movie "Atomic Blonde: No Pity," and even the series "GLOW," in which icons of the East and West wrestling scenes collide.
The comedy by creators Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanak, directed by Rhys Thomas, is intended to be a television production: a drama about two Bucharest police officers from 1980s Romania fighting for truth and atheism in the manner of Marxism-Leninism.
The lead roles - the tenacious Gregor and the idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, who have been drummed into the English language by Channing Tatum (the show's executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a wonderful idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more than that.
You laugh at some of the jokes (like the cops watching chess on TV - a parody of American football).
Many well-known actors have lent their voices to the series - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
But "Comrade Detective" focuses too much on the clumsy propaganda drama - which includes a Reagan-masked killer - and that's what it looks like.
Six long episodes are too long and comedy moments aren't enough.
At shorter notice, the propaganda satire in "Comrade Detective" might work, as in the scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the US Embassy, in whose lobby two fat men devour hamburgers stacked in a big pile.
The clear message to an imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can turn everything into food and orgies.

Russian athletes have not received the lifting of the IAAF launch ban.
The IAAF International Athletics Federation at its London congress confirmed the extension of the international ban on Russian competitors' launches due to a state-sponsored doping programme.
The vote at the stage of the world championships, which begin on Friday, turned out very unequivocally, as expected.
There were 166 delegates in favour of extending the ban, with only 21 against.
The main reason for the rejection is in particular that Russia is failing to meet all the requirements to introduce an anti-doping system, as the head of the IAAF Special Investigation Group, Rune Andersen, noted before Congress.
His group recommended that the ban continue.
Some older doping cases remain unsolved, a number of suspected athletes have yet to be interviewed and trainers with damaged reputations are still working in the country.
Russia's anti-doping agency RUSADA, which does not meet the World Anti-Doping Agency's standards, is not yet fully operational either.
Nevertheless, RUSADA can already conduct testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency.
"While there has been progress, there is still much work to be done," said IAAF President Sebastian Coe.
Russia's athletics federation was suspended in November 2015, losing Russian athletes, among other things, last year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban, 19 Russians will take part in the upcoming WOC, having previously demonstrated that they have been tested outside the Russian anti-doping system for an extended period of time.
But they won't be able to start in national colors in the championship, and if they win, they won't play the Russian anthem.

Bank of England holds interest rate at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, followed by lacklustre economic growth and weakening inflation, which has stifled speculation of a surge in growth.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "on the back burner" in the context of maintaining the interest rate - despite the squeeze on family budgets.
The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) policy makers voted six to two in favour of keeping the interest rate at 0.25%.
In its annual inflation report, the Bank forecast growth of 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that family budget cuts would continue and the Bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the Bank indicated that there should be growth over the next few years as a result of inflation caused by Brexit and also said that rents from movables should rise more than expected in financial markets.
Committee members also voted to withdraw part of a mammoth package designed to boost the economy, which was put into practice a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result, the Term Funding Plan, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, should come into force from next February, although the Bank of England has said it will now offer £15bn less than the £115bn envisaged.
Just before the decision, the Bank said: "The MPC predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term, along with a squeeze on real household incomes and a strain on consumption."
On rates, the Bank said it would need to "tighten the belts on monetary policy" to calm inflation, and to do so "at a higher rate" than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting a first increase in the third quarter of next year and a further increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be "gradual" and "limited."
The Bank downgraded its growth forecast for this year and next, compared with 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
Forecast growth of 1.8% in 2018 remained unchanged.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after the estimates were published.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision to maintain the status quo came after a disappointing increase buried hopes of further growth - GDP stalled at 0.3% in the second quarter, up from 0.2% in the previous three months.
The increase is highly likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is expected to increase slightly towards the end of the year, according to the Bank.
The latest inflation report is little consolation for households hit by rising inflation and miserable pay increases, and the Bank said the situation would get worse before the increase.
The report goes on to state that monetary policy "cannot prevent" a reduction in incomes in the next few years, but wages are expected to rise "significantly" towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Economics should also grow due to the high interest in British goods thanks to the weak pound, offsetting a lower percentage of consumer spending.
This decision came a year after rates were cut to 0.025% last August in response to the shock EU referendum vote, which caused the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that it will take at least four years to fully align prices and the economy.
Before the Bank's decision on the latest rates, many called for an increase in rates, along with rising inflation, which put increasing pressure on households.
Inflation fell back to 2.6% last month from June's 2.9%, even though the Bank said it expected such a change and inflation should pick up again over the next month.
The Bank said the overshoot relative to the 2 % target was "entirely" due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, it looks like competition in the mortgage market will only increase once lenders start competing for contracts with an eye on a good year-end outlook.
The market looks particularly good for those who are ending existing contracts and re-mortgages - there are no-fee options on offer, as well as low rates that are gaining traction."
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 patients
Patients will be given access to 'transformative' treatment to prevent HIV from September, following a Supreme Court ruling on funding for the NHS drug.
England's National Health Service (NSH) has announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pill, which is taken before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 per cent, will be offered through a health service to around 10,000 patients as part of a three-year trial period.
NSH agreed to fund the trial period after the Court of Appeal upheld a Supreme Court ruling last year stating that the NHS had the financial means to pay for PrEP despite declaring that the drug should be funded by local authorities.
The decision, announced on Thursday, was taken by NHS England at the lips of director-general Simon Stevens as a 'major intervention', while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a 'crucial moment'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start accepting patients, with more clinics joining in October and full implementation across England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV medicine given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among patients at risk.
Applying PrEP before sex means that there are enough specific drugs in the patient's body to prevent infection.
These drugs can be taken every day or for at least two hours before sex.
Patients tested include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully treated.
Clinics will identify eligible participants who will sign a consent form to participate in testing, including men, women, transgender people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with a GP in the UK can also enrol in their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential participation in testing.
The scheme will cost taxpayers £10 million and NHS England signed a contract this week to distribute medicines after winning an international public contract.
The trial period is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: 'This important intervention should complement and fully exploit the ever-expanding and increasingly successful pursuit of HIV prevention.
It's another milestone in the more than 30-year quest to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health.'
Deborah Gold, Executive Director of the NAT (National Aids Trust) said: 'We are witnessing a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is administered correctly and patients are at risk, it will offer a chance to change England's HIV epidemic.
From September, NSH will offer patients at high risk of HIV a powerful new tool that is individually controlled and not subject to partner coaxing, which will improve the quality of many lives.
We are pleased to accept this statement.'
Ian Green, executive director of the Terrence Higgins Trust said: 'The number one priority must be the rapid deployment of trials across the country; we must ensure its availability to every patient.
We now have a trial drug, PrEP, and we are well on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of contracting HIV.'
Shadow Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: 'The start of the PrEP trial period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delay and delay by the Government.
Evidence suggests how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
Subsequent tests will bring us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that we start testing as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are exposed to HIV and, together, end the spread of HIV in society.'
If the answers to these questions are yes, institutional investors are likely to favor the poison pill in question.

Living the high life: the mezzanine and smart design turned this small apartment on Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, traded a large house in Knightsbridge for an apartment on Earls Cour in 2014.
She is on the first floor of the Queen Anne's smart terrace - and she is an illustration of modern design that makes the most of available space.
"Before that, I lived with my ex-husband in a much bigger house in the Knightsbridge neighborhood," said Joanne.
"I was looking for something at a more reasonable price.
I came across this flat in Earls Court and it had the same ceiling height.
I fell in love with him right away and nodded to him that same day."
Since then, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
A one-bedroom apartment with a complicated layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add a storage area and a mezzanine level to take advantage of the high ceiling.
"I longed for a high ceiling, big windows, and lots of light.
Those were my demands," she said.
To that end, she employed Erfan Azadi of the Notting Hill-based design and design studio Duck & Shed, and used the nearly four-meter ceiling to create a home that was not merely a project but also a place to live.
The ceiling was not high enough to accommodate two gaps - the architects' challenge was to create a mezzanine on which to walk upright.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
"Steel construction is quite complicated," he explained.
"We had to arrange both spaces so that we could walk upright.
It wasn't just to build a simple platform, but to bend the steel structure so that at the right height above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two full-sized rooms on top of each other - while adding to the drama.
On the mezzanine floor, old copper window frames in the Retrouvius design look down on the gorgeous living room.
Gold-coloured mirror furniture, silver lines and a retro Serge Mouille chandelier create a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in drama, space and lighting.
The short corridor is mirrored on both sides, making it look longer.
The mirror molding in the kitchen looks like a window to another room.
At the front door is a storage area fitted with mirrors to store cutlery and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which gives the whole apartment the impression of a significantly larger space, is the possibility of separating it from the kitchen when not in use.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
But what is unique about this solution is the folding door.
"We had to sort out the technical side," Erfan says of the reinforced veneer doors.
"The door is fitted with a counterweight so that it pulls away very easily."
Thanks to clever use of space and storage space, Joanne got another 16 square metres, a second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
"When it comes down to it, what you're selling is a living area - or valuation of your property," said Erfan.
"The real estate agent basically calculates the price of the apartment on the basis of the living area."
In this case, the living area has been increased while maintaining the quality materials that give the space a luxurious appearance.
"Material is very important because you touch it and form an emotional bond with home," Erfan added.
"You don't love electrical wiring in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but they won't win your heart."
As it turns out, high-quality design and an increase in living space can transform an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And like Joanne, you may decide to stay after all.

The United States is disengaging.
The cultural and political divide between blue and red states is deepening.
California has imposed a travel ban on its citizens to the state of Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee retaliated by imposing a retaliatory travel ban on its citizens to California.
Of course, this is not a full-blown ban, US citizens can travel freely across all 50 states.
The issue is that California has prohibited spending state money on its citizens' travel to eight other states, namely Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who will stop this madness?
California is strongly pro-LGBT and views any sign of disapproval of LGBT lifestyles as discrimination.
However, Tennessee passed the Conscience Restraint Act, according to which a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with the therapy of patients from the LGBT community has no obligation to provide it to them, but has an obligation to provide those patients with another therapist who does not.
Texas and other states have passed laws under which religious charities that received children for adoption from their mothers after birth are not required to provide those children for adoption to same-sex couples.
Because of these conscience-stricken laws, California has banned the funding of its citizens' travel to eight states of the union from its funds.
In practice, this means that California professors are not allowed to have trips to science symposiums in, say, Texas reimbursed by their universities because they are co-sponsored by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions in, say, Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
They have to get either federal grants for travel, but it is absurd for the federal government to fund travel by citizens from State A to State B, or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee ran out of patience, and its parliament passed a law with a resolution that it, too, did not like California's policy of high taxes, high state spending, high deficits, and tolerance of illegal immigrants, but still did not impose a travel embargo on California because of it.
He hails them in retaliation for California's travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will apply to any state of the union that would impose a similar travel ban on another state for any reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That is the facts, now the commentary.
The situation is toxic.
First, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to adopt laws on the reservation of conscience, as well as to decide what their money goes to and what it is not allowed to go to.
Second, what's wrong with a conscience reservation?
If a butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why can't he just offer beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why, under penalty of punishment, force him to sell pork, when there are plenty of butchers offering pork?
In the state of Colorado, a baker is facing an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a heavy fine for refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
But he also refuses to bake cakes for Halloween or containing alcohol.
Why not punish him and leave him alone and order the appropriate cakes from hundreds of other bakers?
Third, the beauty of a federative system is that the constitutional rights of all the citizens of a federation are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust their internal, domestic policies in non-federal powers according to their own, that is, the preferences of their populations.
Then there is diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California, and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California, and Texas and seven other states to be California!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community once legitimately sought tolerance for their lifestyles.
Today, many members of this community follow the live-and-let-live rule that all reasonable people should follow, but some activists seek not tolerance for themselves and others, but extreme intolerance of others.
According to them, no one must ever again show moral, religious or philosophical disapproval of the LGBT lifestyle, and if they do, they are to be criminalised.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are the modern enemies of freedom.
Fifth, I don't know a situation in American history where states have done this sort of thing on political issues, except in one case.
Even during the struggle for black civil rights, where North and West were on the side of integration and South on the side of segregation, the states did not impose sanctions on each other.

A critic of Putin has been slapped with a hefty fine.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny has been fined 300,000 rubles for violating campaign rules ahead of next year's presidential election.
The court fined him for inviting people to participate in unsanctioned demonstrations.
Navalny has organized two large anti-government street protests in the last two months and has announced that he wants to apply for the post of head of state in March next year.
The Kremlin's acting chief, Vladimir Putin, has not yet declared his candidacy, but he is widely expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to his house this morning and took him to court.
He fined him for inviting people to demonstrate through videos posted on the YouTube website.
The fine is 300,000.
"We'll deduct them from the judge's salary later," a Kremlin critic joked in a Twitter post.
Russia's electoral commission recently concluded that Navalny could not participate in the presidential election because he had previously been convicted of embezzlement.
However, Navalny, who is considered a campaigner against corruption, considers the sentence to be politically motivated.
Fines of 300,000 roubles, or 25,000 roubles, were also imposed by the court on Thursday on two members of Navalny's campaign team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant figure in the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend Navalny in every way possible in the campaign.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year suspended sentence for robbing a Kirovles forestry business.
In May, the verdict was upheld by the Court of Appeal.
The sentence is thus final, preventing Navalny from running under Russian law.

Brothers fight over $500 million empire
Two brothers are now, more than four decades after the empire was founded by their Italian family, vying for one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth more than $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis is staying at the Toorak estate, just three rooms away from his younger brother Paul, who has driven a dispute over joint property and business assets to the supreme court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business as early as 2014, but the bitter dispute is constantly being litigated before the supreme court.
Together with his mother Anna, the brothers own a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, first purchased by the family in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
This is where the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a chain of 160 stone stores.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for $85 million.
Other properties have been bought with the money, and the De Lutis family portfolio now includes offices, building land in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and shopping centres in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one-third of the company's assets, while his father, Colin, who, in Paul's words, is a "significant driving force and dominant figure" in the De Lutis family, owns less than two-thirds of the assets.
Court filings indicate that Colin owns $316 million worth of real estate, while Paul manages $176 million worth of real estate.
For Paul, it was the division of assets and funds that became problematic.
"Colin's suggestion, in my eyes, was strongly in his favor," Paul wrote in a sworn statement to the court in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed attempts at reconciliation, the first session of the Supreme Court was held.
The brothers are now also competing to control the existing business - from which he claims Colin cut Paul off.
Colin counters that this is untrue and accuses Paul of mishandling some properties.
In a previous affidavit, Colin said he believed in a successful resolution of the conflict.
"My Italian background dictates that family is the most important of all," he wrote.
Hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer are flooding with attorneys, including Allan Myers, QC, and attorneys for both sides.
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who had run milk bars and delis since the 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the 1970s.
With the money raised by mortgaging the property, they bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the family's first jeans business.
Colin said that when he founded Westco "in his senior year of college, Paul was just a little boy, about 10 years old."
Anna De Lutis said that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, had hoped that the transfer of the estate to the sons would be done in a peaceful manner.
"Luigi often said he never wanted his sons to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family group of companies.
As Paul put it, both Luke and Mark "were not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation."
Colin has held back ever since, despite the fact that he is a former board member of the AFL club, as stated in his 2015 autobiography Eddie McGuire, a well-known television personality and best friend of Colin.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied via text message, stating that due to the fact that the dispute was being settled in court, "I have nothing further to add."
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to take the matter to court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, in one of the court statements, Colin said he had tried to adapt to his brother's demands.
"Our father would be very displeased to see our current situation," he said, adding that he "still hopes for a successful solution."
On Friday, all hope was in the wind.
"Our differences will be resolved in court shortly," Colin wrote.

Heat in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower children.
MHD drivers are given water and summer clothes.
At the nursery school Na Chodovci in Prague 4, where about 35 children are now attending, they go out only in the mornings.
The nursery is reconstructed and the trees planted do not yet provide much shade.
There's no pool, but the teachers shower the kids in the fog bank.
In the afternoon, the children stay in classrooms where the blinds are drawn and the curtains drawn.
The air is trying to cool down with an air purifier because they don't have air conditioning.
It's also challenging for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature, which is both indoors and exterior, exceeds the hygiene limits for nursery schools, so we shouldn't really have open operations during this period," said Miloslava Makovičková, the nursery director.
There's a glass corridor in the nursery where she says the temperature is in the mid-40s.
We ventilate the morning after 6:00, the windows close, and we have blinds on the south side to protect ourselves.
"But it doesn't help much," she added.
They have better conditions at the Na Hrázi forest nursery in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outdoors.
We have mature trees on the property, so we're underneath them.
"We have a beautiful walnut tree with a table underneath, and we do things there," said Barbora Kompan, the nursery manager.
Teachers try to take their kids to the woods, where it's cooler.
Children's wet hats and various water games are on the agenda.
"We have a hand-held pressure sprayer used to spray flowers, and we use it to shower children," Kompan said.
Also, the head of the kindergarten in Novoborská street on Prosek in Prague, Jitka Vilimovská, said that the teachers try to keep the children in the shade and sprinkle water on them.
"We have a fairly mature garden, so they're under the trees," she said.
He goes out in the morning, and after that, after 3 p.m.
Every child must wear a headdress.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
They can choose low-sweetened tea or watered-down juice, for example, and have water fountains in the garden.
They also have a vegetable salad to eat every day, and always fresh fruit and vegetables to snack on, sometimes brought by their parents.
"Maybe today one of the moms brought about a ten-pound melon for the kids," Makovickova added.
Drivers get water or a summer uniform.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with water, ion drinks or summer uniforms on hot days.
The cabins of both tram and bus drivers are air-conditioned in most cases, DPP spokeswoman Aneta Řehková said.
In addition to the cabins, some trams are air-conditioned in the passenger compartment.
The tram tracks have not been seriously damaged by the high temperatures.
Minor damage occurred in a loop in the Hostivar.
At the current high temperatures, we are particularly careful to ensure that sufficient beverages are available to drivers.
"Chilled drinking water is available in all loops, switching points and carriageways," said Řehkova.
In roadworks and at some relief sites, employees have so-called sodobars, which produce refrigerated soda.
Drivers also receive soluble protective ion ion drinks.
"They can also make use of the summer uniform, which increases the comfort of drivers during their daily shifts," the spokesperson added.
The hot and dry weather of the past few days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters wiped out 108 of them across the Czech Republic, double the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday, during a day when temperatures in the Czech Republic climbed over 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters were mainly busy fighting the blaze.
"Fires predominate in the natural environment, as well as those associated with the deer works," said firefighter spokeswoman Nicole Zaoralova.
There was no relief for firefighters from the evening weather change, when the heat in a number of places was replaced by thunderstorms and torrential rainfall.
Firefighters were making 236 calls in the wake of the storms.
It was mainly about removing fallen trees and branches.
"They intervened most in the Midlands," Zaoralova continues.
But help from firefighters was also needed in the Shadowlands of Českolipsko, where 60 people from a children's camp were evacuated to safety due to the storm.
Tropical temperatures have also put Prague's rescue workers to work.
On Tuesday and through the night of Wednesday, ambulances raced to a dozen cases of card-based carbon monoxide poisoning.
People should therefore have their water heaters checked, rescue workers warn.
Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas released during imperfect combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and feeling faint.
If poisoning is suspected, leave the infested room.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to curtail the president's media diet
Before him, many have tried and always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he'll be the first.
The Politico website reported that the new chief of staff at the White House plans to restrict President Trump's flow of information - including television news stories - in hopes of keeping Trump afloat.
Here's part of reporter Josh Dawsey's report:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with staff on his first day in the new job, he outlined a key problem for the Trump White House that he intends to fix: incorrect information coming into the president's hands.
Kelly told the staff that he had to personally approve all information - whether on paper or spoken word - because the President could make a better decision based on the right information."
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors cut their teeth checking Trump and his media presentation.
Trump's relationship with the media dates back several decades - and now that he's sitting in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
"If Trump as a candidate was upset by the stories of honor, it was fitting to show him that he was being talked about in a positive light by a lot of other media that were easier to convince," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
At the time, Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote that "the key to keeping Trump's tweets in check - at least in the words of six former organizers of his campaign - is to ensure that Trump regularly watches the media singing his praises."
All right.
But the idea that Trump's tendency to post his views on Twitter was ever "under control" is ludicrous.
Perhaps these campaign organizers know something others don't - that Trump's tweets would be more inflammatory if they weren't checked.
We'll very likely never know about the tweets Trump never sent.
If his staff had managed to rein him in at least a few times, their efforts had come to nothing.
But no one has been able to regularly stop Trump from fueling controversial issues.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which consists of competing factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by slipping Trump materials - which may or may not be reliable - that support their view of the world.
The Politico portal, which has covered the issue from all sides, published a report in May on advisors' propensity for presenting questionable information to heads of state.
This is an example of such information from reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that the president often reacts very angrily to negative media reports, especially leak reports, and seeks to find their origin.
This situation occurred at the end of February when someone slipped the President a copy of an article from GotNews.com - the website of provocateur Charles C. Johnson - that accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the White House's "source of many leaks."
No matter that Johnson has been banished from Twitter forever for harassment; or that he has not substantiated his claim with any evidence; or that he has made false accusations in the past and later retracted them.
Trump read the article and started asking about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter "sought to implement a system to manage and document the information that President Trump receives."
Would it work?
Kelly is now trying to pull off the same strategy three months later.
He may turn out to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulsiveness won't go away, and his aides are still competing for power.
These immutable factors will certainly make Kelly's mission worse.

Tourists negotiate ditch and return to 'Millionaire Quarter'
Several of the most affluent homeowners in England's West Midland are once again engaged in a dispute with determined tourists as they negotiate with local authorities for the rights to reclaim the fields behind their mansions.
The tourists parked 20 caravans in a field off a thriving street in Solihull, which has been dubbed the "millionaire's district."
Carrying horses, children and an army of caravans, the tourists return after being banished in May, unafraid of the ditch that was dug at the site by order of the authorities to prevent their incursion.

One resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: 'They occupied the site on Monday night after being moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw rocks at other people.
The board should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists have been moved to another location and now they're back.

Another anonymous resident commented: 'This is ridiculous. just the other day we were watching the last tourists leaving and now they're back.
And this time there are more, and this time they brought their horses with them.'

In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is essential that as many local residents as possible report any unsociable or unlawful behaviour to the police on 101.

Italians tighten up in fight against NGO rescue ships with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will block the arrival of NGO rescue ships coming to the coast of Italy with immigrants from the Mediterranean unless the NGO signs new rules regulating their operations.
"If the NGO does not sign new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to imagine that they could continue their operations," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a ship from the German rescue organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion of human trafficking, greatly facilitating illegal immigration.
The rescue organization, which is in its first year, declined to comment on the matter because of allegations made by Italian State Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosios.
"For us, saving people's lives is and always will be the number one priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot currently operate in rescue zones," the organisation said in a social media statement.
"We can only comment on any current allegations after gathering all the information and assessing the situation."
Italian authorities had been tracking the Iuventa ship of the Jugend Rettet since October.
Its crew is suspected of transporting immigrants on the ship, handed over directly by human traffickers, repeatedly.
At least one meeting took place, according to the plaintiff's file, allegedly only 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya.
The ship's crew is suspected of breaking the law and bypassing the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area - out of humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The code of conduct establishes the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as the Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine non-governmental non-profit organisations involved in rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the code: Save The Children, Malta's MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter organisation said on Thursday that the new rules were not necessary but acceptable as they did not represent any "substantial change or obstacle" to rescue operations.
For example, the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has also rejected the adoption of a new code of conduct.
Meanwhile, Minniti has said that the sharp drop in immigrants landing in Italy in recent weeks as part of rescue operations suggests that efforts to increase patrols off the coast of Libya and cooperation with local mayors are bearing fruit.
"In recent days we are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.

Michelle Carter convicted of sending text messages encouraging suicide of Conrad Roy
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two years' imprisonment for inciting her boyfriend to commit suicide by text messages and phone calls.
Twenty-year-old Michelle Carter will serve 15 months of a two-year prison sentence and then spend five years on probation.
Carter was convicted in June for the involuntary manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
In court on Thursday, Roy's father said, "The whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was left free pending the decision.
She faced up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood where she was when the verdict was announced, tears in her eyes, hands clasped, eyes pointing to the ground.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the judge.
"She ended his life to relieve herself.
She could not accept her own responsibility," she said.
"She showed no remorse."
But Carter's attorney said it was "unfortunate circumstances that she deeply regrets."
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that ‘her age or level of maturity or even mental impairment does not have a significant impact on her actions’.
The claimant read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy: "Not a day goes by that I don't mourn the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I care for his sisters and together we will endure the immense pain we will carry with us forever," the statement said.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the knowledge that she would never attend her brother's wedding and would never be his children's aunt.
"The loss of a man I have been seeing since I was born is a pain I will carry with me for life," she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a law in place to sanction a person aiding and abetting the suicide of another person, so this case sets a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in a car seat in 2014, poisoned by carbon dioxide.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages that incited suicide were released.
"Maybe hang yourself, jump off a building or stab yourself, I don't care," said text messages Carter sent just two weeks before his death while Roy was on a family vacation.
Minutes before the suicide, she texted him, "You have to do this Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter wanted attention through Roy's death and ordered her to refrain from making any comments in the press.
The case raised many questions.
One of the people who sided with Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007.
Ms. Knox (30) published a statement in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not jail."
The report is subject to an investigation by the State Commission on the Conduct of Judges, which has the right to impose sanctions.

Audi to modify up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to sharp response
Just a day before Audi's announcement, carmaker BMW said it would offer its customers software updates in more than 350,000 vehicles.

Lavender of Provence is threatened by climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of Provence in the region of south-eastern France, but is now under threat from climate change.
Lavender is declining due to a dry climate and harmful insects, causing consternation on the faces of researchers and farmers looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence said: "Lavender growing in Provence is under threat because over the last few years the plant has been exposed to climate changes, with less rainfall in spring and autumn.
This affects the lifespan of lavender.
Cicadas and locusts carrying micro-bacteria that thrive in dry climates are also to blame."
The stakes are high.
Lavender attracts tourists and the oil produced from it is an important ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: 'Instead of long and beautiful flowers, smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants grow.
The amount of oil extracted from these lavenders is understandably smaller."
A possible solution may be to distribute water more efficiently and slow down the evaporation of water from the soil, but also to spray lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water, and to breed more species resistant to dry weather.

Murder of journalist highlights growing threats in Mexico
Staff of Riodoce weekly meet regularly every Wednesday to discuss the news of the riots taking place in the Sinaloa region involving organised criminals, corrupt officials and the relentless drug wars.
Today, however, under the strain of recent events, they gather mainly for their own safety.
They learn that it's important for them to change their habits.
Two well-deserved journalists talk about what would be safer: taking their children with them to an office that was attacked with a grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the black board: adversaries, neutrals, and allies.
They ask journalists to put names to every word - no evidence is needed, just use imagination and foreboding.
Picking them out of what - drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of taking money from the government or drug cartels - a catalogue of criminals tasked with covering up criminal behaviour.
Violence continues and bodies pile up across the country; journalists continue to arrive among them: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, there are at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto came to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection following attacks and threats; and seven have been killed this year in all seven states.
Among them was the co-founder of the periodical Riodioce, an editor and inspiration to colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and working as a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on the violence involved in the drug trade.
His loss is palpable, though his presence is all-pervasive - a large photograph of Valdez with the word "Justice" on it, in which he gives the finger, hangs in the front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - aged over 30, wearing a T-shirt with a photograph of Valdez with a smile on his face, glasses on his nose, and a Panama cap.
The meeting comes less than two months after his death; journalists talk about mutual traumas, nightmares, insomnia, and paranoia.
Even though a special federal prosecutor was established in 2010 to handle journalists' cases, it has so far sued two suspects, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur every year are associated with drug trafficking and organized crime, so journalist killers very rarely go to trial.
Journalists from Riodoca insist on reporting on the violence happening in Sinaloa; even though they are devastated by grief and the territory is currently very treacherous.
Without information about the killers and without a vision of justice, a meeting about security is pointless, Ibarra says.
"It's foolish to waste time on meetings like this," he adds.
"Unless we get more information, nobody can be trusted."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce headquarters in Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloa.
He managed to get several blocks away when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 bullets, apparently because of the title of the article - which translates as Twelfth River.
The gunmen then got into his car and crashed it not far from the scene.
Valdez died at age 50.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
Rumours seem to be spreading fast in Culiacan.
In Valdez's case, however, there is a suspicious silence.
Since the arrest of Guzmán last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions try to fill the void.
Several people are killed every day on the streets of Sinaloa, and the cemetery is filled with ornate two-story mausoleums for drug kingpins, many of them larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word "truce" means that one drug cartel controls a coastal state with precious ports and important routes through which drugs travel to the United States.
In spite of this, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately acquainted with the risks of his employment, Ismail Bojorquez (60), Riodoce's co-founder and director, continues to lay bare the fact that he did not protect his friend.
He believes two wrongdoings contributed to his death.
The first was the February edition of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that waged war on the sons of Joaquín Guzmán.
The conciliation might have angered the sons; the suspected gang members had bought up all the copies of the newspaper the moment they landed on the counters.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of other newspapers in which the same story was printed.
Valdez has become a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is viewed as an important milestone in the fight of Mexican criminals against journalists.
He had managed to survive for so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that would never change.
He was practically a veteran in the Noroeste periodical when, in 2003, he decided to sell his $50 worth of stock and set up Riodoce with five of his colleagues.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run a newspaper without mentioning the drug trade," said Bojorquez.
Riodoce gained a reputation over time for its brave and truthful reporting; newspapers began to prosper.
Journalists liked to dig into problem topics and publish texts without censorship - readers were fascinated to read stories no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for reporting on Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his brave reporting on Mexico's drug trade.
Valdez openly admitted he was scared.
"I feared for my life," he said as he accepted the award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloae is a "way of life," Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV in October last year.
"You have to take on the role of journalist - or play dumb.
I don't want to be asked, 'What did you do in the face of death . . . why didn't you say what was going on?'"
Riodoce employees miss Valdez. the man was known for his wit and indiscriminate language. he was a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs -- a teacher who knew how to survive.
They all relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his cap.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar across from the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: did this routine cause his death?
His death also raised questions about their own assumptions - how do you do your job best and stay alive?
"They don't like you messing with their wives, children, clean shops, secret landing sites."
"These things were forbidden," said Bojorquez.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel there's something wrong, hands off.
The problem, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, is that "smell is a sense that can be fooled . . . and then the Javier thing happened."
The old rules, he says, like the others, no longer apply in Sinaloae - as they do in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling trails, weak governments, and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No cell phones are allowed in the room where Riodoce employees meet; indeed, spyware was discovered a few days ago, bought by governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
Outside the building, two police officers find relief from the 40-degree heat in the shade of a nearby tree.
They were chosen by the state to protect the offices of Riodoce, located in a four-story building in the city's Culiacan district.
Journalists poke fun at whether these particular police officers are one of the 50 percent of law enforcement officials who the government says are corrupt.
It has been months since journalists last went to mountainous areas that are essentially controlled by drug cartels.
There are three major stories on this week's agenda.
The first is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio Caesar Chávez in Sinaloa.
They also have a spotlight on suspicious government spending that took place in the state governor's hometown.
There have also been several recent abductions at one of Culiacán's most luxurious restaurants, just a block from the state's attorney's office.
Officially, no one reported the identities of the kidnapped people or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so journalists were wary of writing about what every city resident knew: that the restaurant was a favorite destination for drug traffickers and politicians.
One journalist read from public records that the restaurant was registered under a name associated with a politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), controlling all levels of the political scene for nearly the last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of high-level corruption.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about earlier incidents at the restaurant, including one in which one of the sons of Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán escaped an army SWAT team.
A month ago, readers would have read about the subject in Valdez's column, the best source of information on kidnappings.
"Valdez would certainly crack the case," said Villarreal (46), who is nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender frame.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office was turned into a warehouse of signs and stickers to protest the killing of journalists, and the staff certainly didn't expect them to become activists on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed several signs and went to demonstrate outside the state's attorney's office the following morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of Michoacán state.
Only the charred body was discovered, and authorities say that based on DNA analysis, it's Adame.
Journalist activity is intensifying across the country, with many organizing protests and scribbling "SOS press" on sidewalks and buildings.
The newspaper's director, Bojorquez, is visiting Washington for the day, seeking international support and justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with the Sinaloa governor the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of stalking journalists and murdering them for telling the truth.
Meanwhile, she requested a transfer to another department out of concern that her anger might compromise her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are being “bypassed” by organized crime, corrupt officials, and an indifferent public.
In his latest book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that journalists die not only at the hands of drug cartels, but also at the behest of politicians and security forces who cooperate with organized crime.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 blamed police and public officials for more than half of all attacks on journalists.
"In Mexico, you die because they want to silence you," Ramirez added.
Murders obviously work.
No one will forget the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Macías six years ago at the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note purportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "This is how I ended up because of my reports."
Next to the severed head was a keyboard and headphones.
Some branches have decided to close down, such as the El Norte newspaper, based near the northern borders of Chihuahua state, in response to the murder of the rapporteur Miroslava Breach in March.
The others are still going on, just as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after killing its director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed drug cartels publicly with a front-page article entitled "What do you want from us"?
Some journalists have fled their homes or even across the border.
It's a difficult decision.
Finding work in exile is difficult, as is getting rid of the feeling that you are constantly being hunted.
And journalists are hunted down and killed, as in the case of Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who choose to stay and not give up their jobs, every day is a big risk.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a poet someday, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, that's why I became a journalist," he posted.
It's midnight on Friday and the Riodoce staff are sitting on the sidewalk outside the office - the latest edition sent to the printer - drinking beer when suddenly the phone starts ringing.
They learn that 19 people died in a shootout between gang members and police officers near a beach resort in the town of Mazatlán.
The war is escalating, just as many messages left in the area by members of the syndicate promised.
Journalists publish the news from a mobile phone on the website of Riodoce.
Not a day goes by and the opening headline changes again.
Sounds of police sirens point to another gunfight.
Bojorquez casts a glance at the police patrol to see if they're paying attention.
If they're scared, they don't show it.
Beneath a huge portrait of their periodical's fallen co-founder - whose middle finger is an eloquent slogan for all of Sinaloa - all of Riodoc's employees follow his footsteps.
"How could we even think about leaving," Bojorquez said, "when on the same day Javier was killed, an intern asked me to put her on the streets?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however terrifying.
Researchers have now uncovered the conclusions of the first findings of an amazing rhino-sized creature whose perfectly preserved remains - what experts have called the 'Mona Lisa of dinosaurs' - were found by a Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved to such a high degree that experts were able to determine the reddish-brown color of its scaly skin and said the dinosaur had a 'troubled past'.
An article in the journal Current Biology said it was "the best-preserved armored dinosaur found to date and one of the best species of dinosaur in the world."
The fossil is a new species of the Nodosauridae family. The dinosaur lived during the Cretaceous period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition shocked the researchers, who described it as 'truly remarkable.'
The armored white-eater is still the best preserved fossil of its kind, according to National Geographic.
Behind the find is Shawn Funk, who uncovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling at the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
He came across what appeared to be a foreign object and decided to examine it more closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Researchers spent the next six years working to unearth the animal from a huge piece of land weighing 1100kg.
When the work is done, the dinosaur is ready to be unveiled.
"'Just squint a little and you'll believe it's asleep,' said lead researcher Caleb Brown and a naturalist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is on display.
'It will most certainly go down in history as one of the most beautiful and tame species of dinosaur - the Mona Lisa dinosaurs.'
By studying its skin, the researchers found that this herbivore - despite being covered in armour and resembling a walking tank - was highly likely to face a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a camouflage system used by many of today's animals.
Experts say this enabled him to blend in better with his surroundings and avoid his enemies, a camouflage system that suggests he was the favourite food of the larger dinosaurs.
Reports of the 110-million-year-old dinosaur family Nodosauridae first appeared in the paper in May. It is currently available for consultation at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, who, along with the team, spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering the fossil.
Thanks to the wonderfully preserved state of the fossil, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the patterns and shape of scales and armor all over the body.
They uncovered a camouflage method commonly used by today's animals to defend themselves - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this camouflage effect is common in nature, the researchers' findings are surprising because Borealopelta's size far exceeds today's animals using the same technique.
So it's possible that the dinosaur was so many predators that evolution preferred camouflage to confrontation in survival.
Many contemporary animals with camouflage - deer, zebra, or armadillo, for example - are much smaller and also more vulnerable to prey, suggesting that the nosodaurus had to literally fight for its survivors.
'The predation of a huge and heavily armoured dinosaur illustrates the danger posed by predators in the Cretaceous period,' said Brown.
Chemical analysis of the organic components contained in the scales also revealed that the dinosaur skin was likely reddish-brown in colour.
Researchers continue to study the animal, searching for more information about its life, including preserved stomach contents, to track down its last meal.
They believe the dinosaur fell into the river after it died and was carried to the sea, where it sank to the bottom.
The Alberta region at the time had the same climate as Florida today, and rivers and oceans stretched much farther inland than they do today.
'This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved scaly skin while being preserved in three dimensions and so we can see its original size,' said Brown.
'For these reasons, the animal looks virtually the same as it did in the Cretaceous Age.
You don't have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; just squint a little and it seems as if he's just sleeping.'
In the Cretaceous period, giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs that moved on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived for several million years after Borealopelta, this armoured dinosaur may have been a favourite prey of his equally fearsome ancestors.
They include Acrocanthosaurus, an 11.5-meter-long monster weighing over 6 tons.
The researchers, whose most recent findings were published in the journal Current Biology, believe the body of Borealopelt was washed into the sea after being mummified in mud.
Behind the find is Shawn Funk, who uncovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling at the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including leather and armor, which is also complete from snout to hip.
The animal was 5 meters in diameter and weighed up to 1,300 pounds.
Two 5-inch spines protruded from his shoulders.
Researchers believe this herbivore ploughed through what is now Canada until it ended up in a river that washed it out to sea.
His underwater tomb preserved the body in perfect condition.
The fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remnants of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, finding such a surviving individual can be compared to winning the lottery.
The longer I watch him, the more shocking the find seems.
The fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remnants of the skin.
At his side lies his right front foot with his fingers pointing up.
I can easily count the scales on his foot.'

How did one activist get the answer to the question, 'Whose Streets?'
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shuddered all over.
The day after she arrived in New York, the St. Louis native sat on a bed in an Airbnb room and went through Facebook posts on her phone.
She came across a contribution from a high school student.
"Police have just shot an 18-year-old whose body is still lying in the street," it said.
She wondered why no one else had written her that post, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
User @TheePharoah kept retweeting her posts on the wall.
The St. Louis rapper was posting on Twitter about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old who was shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photograph of Brown's body lying limp in the street, where it had not been taken four hours later.
"That's crazy," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her or her community.
She put the phone down to return to it on the evening she watched the tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
One of the men claimed to be the victim's father, holding a sign that said, "Ferguson Police Killed My Unarmed Son!"
She watched the live news - one of the policemen standing in front of a group of protesters, holding a leash and a barking dog at the other end.
In another video, another officer, she said, was holding a gun he was pointing at a crowd, yelling, "I'm going to kill you all ... animals."
"It's not normal," Ferrell told herself.
"This isn't the kind of murder we've grown accustomed to and can call normal.
I felt goose bumps all over my body.
"I was angry and crying."
She immediately booked a return flight and travelled home the next day.
After landing at 11:00 p.m., she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father's and decided to travel to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years is described in a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," which will be released in theaters on August 11.
It's a story of survival and protest, love and resistance, strength and resilience told from the perspective of people living in a community who take to the streets demanding answers.
On her way to Ferguson, Ferrell introduced a dialogue with her daughter - dressed in a floral jersey and matching floral headdress - about a subject they had discussed many times before - "the experience of the Negro."
"Remember when I taught you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?" she recalls the conversation.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old and that's not right."
"There was no way I wasn't going to take her with me," Ferrell said later.
"Today's events are the culmination ... of past events.
She had to know and see for herself and grow up in it.
It needed to develop not only in activism and organizing, but it also needed to recognize the difference between different layers of experience with black people and what we had to do to set ourselves free.
Even though I'm able to provide her with conditions in which she won't experience racism firsthand, she's no different from any other black child-woman.
I feel that to protect her from this experience would only harm her."
Upon arrival in Ferguson, the first stop was South Florissant Road, across from the police department, which became the base of activists awaiting words from Officer Darren Wilson about his possible involvement in the incident.
It was here that Ferrell and her daughter met a local entrepreneur who prepared meals for the others.
Together they prepared the food in bags and helped deliver it to the Protestants.
A new type of activism was slowly emerging in Ferrell's eyes.
"My activism turned upside down after August 9," Ferrell said, adding that while attending college at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and sought to establish health care and food in black communities.
"I had no experience in organization.
It was natural."
A few weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met the documentary's later co-director, Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said he and her cameraman, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, wanted to "just document" ongoing events.
But Ferrell wondered, "Are you working on a documentary or trying to find a story to exploit?"
This type of skepticism filtered into the community through many people, often white, who wanted to profit from pain and resolve.
As Folayan explained in a non-interview, "We've heard that the voices of people who are born and raised in Ferguson are very often neglected, and we wanted to change that."
Folayan has already established a collaboration with co-director Damon Davis, who is an acclaimed local artist who deals with the subject of death row inmates.
His participation in the project also integrated Ferrell and, along with six other local residents, who were tracked by the "Whose Streets?" team in the years following Brown's assassination.
"No one speaks for us in this document, but it's our testimony," Davis said.
"That was important to me - how these people would be represented - because in the same way I would be represented."
While the documentary was not intended to focus on Ferrell's experiences - in an attempt to portray that the movement "is not about a savior leader, but about bringing the community together," Folayan said - it turned out to be the one most open to participating in filmmaking.
The documentary "Whose Streets?" thus describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, such as how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said with a smile on her face, thinking of the first moment she saw the final version of the documentary.
"But I understood that in order to do this job and humanize black people, I had to open up."
Moreover, Ferrell's story highlights the role of the eccentric black woman in the larger aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders - who created a social media campaign under #BlackLivesMatter in response to the killing of teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 - call themselves weirdos.
"Ultimately, black eccentric women in leadership positions are behind the preservation of the movement," Ferrell said, "because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women must endure the weight of these events."
Folayan agrees with this statement, adding that "the movement is actually supported by black women and a great many eccentric black women."
She insists, however, that "this is not a mere affirmative matter," and Ferrell is not the main heroine of the documentary because of her views.
"She was the driving force and the energy source," she said.
"that she, of all people, is on the front lines is no accident, because life at these intersections in the skin of a black queer woman is dangerous.
You can feel the rush of energy in front of the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, television station cameras have cleared out their positions, but heavy racial ties between the community and the police remain.
Ferrell is serving a two-and-a-half-year probation for blocking a highway in demonstrations.
The social political atmosphere in what she calls home has been described as "disorder."
Yet she persists in her quest, which she has pledged since she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
All we have to lose are our chains."
A field was burning on Cologne.
Dozens of firefighters went to the scene, along with a helicopter.
Near Český Brod in Cologne, between the municipalities of Bylany and Liblice, a field of some 15 hectares was on fire as of 2 p.m.
The fire stopped spreading around 3:15 p.m., and firefighters issued a third fire alarm out of four possible ones.
A helicopter also helped to extinguish the fire from the air, according to firefighter spokesman Ladislav Holomčík.
At 6 p.m., firefighters managed to extinguish the blaze, causing 7,000 kroner worth of damage.
Dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters battled the flames at the scene.
The fire was caused by a technical failure in the engine compartment of the combine.
A helicopter also helped extinguish it, making six water drops in all.
"The site of the intervention has been handed over to the owner, and will be guarded by a unit of volunteer firefighters until 8:00 a.m. tomorrow," Hollows said today.
A Becoming Resemblance: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the center of one of the rooms of New York's Fridman Gallery are several faces of different skin tones - white, black and brown - suspended from the ceiling on wires, each one seeming to be the same as the last.
All 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from swabs taken from her mouth and hair, sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for illegally leaking secret cables to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is entitled A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines her experience with technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender and pioneering dissident whose sentence was reduced by Obama three days before he left the US presidency.
By algorithmically analyzing Manning's DNA and using 30 portraits to represent what a person with this genotype would look like, Dewey-Hagborg created a razor-sharp, if not intellectual, commentary on the pliability of DNA - as well as the many ways DNA can be interpreted - and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, as well as identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward Manning, has talked since she was young about considering herself a woman, convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including violating six espionage laws, computer fraud and theft.
All of her photographs were held by prison staff, and only one lower-quality black-and-white photo was leaked, showing Manning, visibly concerned, sitting in the driver's seat of the platinum blonde wig she is now associated with.
Positive reactions to Dewey-Hagborg's 2012 Stranger Visions project were still reverberating in 2015.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects - such as cigarette butts and chewing gum - to create an image of possible likenesses of these people.
And it was around this time that she received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They were going to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and they wanted to fill the article with a portrait," Dewey-Hagborg explained at the opening of the new exhibition.
However, no visitors or photographs were allowed, so they approached Chelsea to ask if she would be interested in a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became friends over two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, which presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea were pardoned and could attend the exhibition in person.
President Obama did ask for Manning's release days after the comic, a welcome change after a few excruciating years in a military prison in Kansas.
Indeed, it is interesting that the exhibition is taking place at a time when Donald Trump is at war with people who seek to make public government information and transgender soldiers, while trying to find new ways to stir up resentment in areas he should be encouraging with his tweets.
In response to a question about this particular timing, Dewey-Hagborg said that "everything happens for a reason."
Under the declaration of an artist on one of the gallery walls, Manning's huge signature (the "i" in the surname is dotted with a heart) calls for the end of "self-indulgent factionalism that is based on gender, race, sexuality, and culture."
On the opposite side are sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - a centipede of the letters C, G and A recorded in pencil.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the artist's sophisticated scientific vocabulary), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate just how surprisingly similar, at least biologically, we all are.
"I hope people learn from this that our genome doesn't care who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and anyone can interpret it in their own way," Dewey-Hagborg said.
"DNA tells many different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last specimen of the exhibition, housed in a separate room, is a single page from the aforementioned graphic novel.
It depicts Manning emerging, King Kong style, from the United States Disiplinary Barracks Prison with a megaphone in her hand.
"Once they stop you from speaking, they win," it says.
"Never be silenced."
"It's a direct transcript from one of the letters," said the Philadelphia artist.
"Thinking about it gives me the creeps."
Manning has not yet personally visited the exhibit - which was predicted in the comic book - but when she does, she will be greeted in the center of the room with her masks, her own genome effigies, lined up like a crowd of Protestants.
Which was also the purpose of the exhibition, including the nearly 160 cm tall statue of Maning, on which her genetic haplogroups are penciled.
"They've been placed on walls in the past, but this time I wanted the feel of the crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted to create the impression of mass movement that takes the form of Chelsea and liberates her."
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted for murder
A nationwide manhunt is underway these days for a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University staff members who are being held on suspicion of murdering a man who was found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
A warrant was issued Monday for the first-degree murder of a man named Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged complicity in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, the Cook County court filing states.
The document says Cornell-Duranleau (26) died from multiple stab wounds.
Chicago police said the body of the deceased was found July 27.
Officers were alerted by telephone when they arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments to find the victim in one of the apartments with multiple lacerations.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and detectives are investigating the case as a homicide, while police are searching for the two suspects, authorities said.
Lathem has worked as an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the university's vice president of public relations, said in an e-mailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from campus.
"The matter is now under investigation by the relevant authorities and Northwestern University is cooperating fully with them," said Cubbage.
Warren is an executive financial trustee at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an e-mailed statement: "We have been contacted by the British police and are ready to assist the American police as well."
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues were shocked by the whole fact and wish him to come forward to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of public relations for the Chicago Police Department said he was urging suspects to surrender to the appropriate authorities.
"The police have information on their whereabouts, and efforts to track down the suspects are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national authorities are assisting police in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who was alerted to events that were about to take place in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was unclear if the incident occurred on July 27.
He added that Lathem and Warren were captured by security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," said Guglielmi.
Grand Plaza management issued a statement to all residents: "Police are now working to compile a timeline and profile of the victim and are investigating various motives, including domestic violence."

'We will finalise WADA plan in the near future' - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not be long before the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria were implemented and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) re-established.
"Part of the criteria of the new plan have now been finalised and RUSADA has already been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In light of this, the WADA plan has been updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of WADA's plan to comply with the code - which describes the criteria for RUSADA's reinstatement - which was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, the code contains nothing for Russia to worry about.
"Everything has been announced and will be implemented as well.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA shortly," he added.
However, one of those criteria calls for a public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation, under investigation by Richard McLaren, into alleged government sponsorship of doping by Russian athletes.
On this subject, Mutko said: "We are conducting an investigation as our anti-doping system has clearly failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no state programs in our country, and we can't admit to something that never existed."
Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission, confirmed Mutko's words.
In an interview with Russia's RSport, Smirnov acknowledged the problems of Russian anti-doping officials, but added: "We have said on many occasions that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report completely unreservedly," Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSAD of carrying out doping controls within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
Nevertheless, the organisation authorised the planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) in June this year.
Following a visit to the organisation's Moscow headquarters in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA was "on the right track" to be reinstated.

The state counts on its citizens to defend the state.
They will support their training.
With financial support for alliances that can be used in the defense of the state, with voluntary shooting training, or with a team of training instructors, the substantive intent of the Civil Readiness Act is to defend the state.
The Ministry of Defence, which has been given the task of processing it by the government, hopes that it will be able to increase the physical prowess of the Czechs and their capabilities, which could then be used by the state in crisis situations.
This follows from a draft prepared by the Ministry.
If the law were adopted in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns to promote branding.
The basic aim of the proposal, according to its authors, is to create an effective system to help increase the readiness of the people of the Czech Republic to defend the state, outside the exercise of conscription and on a voluntary basis.
For example, the state would support alliances of radio amateurs, riflemen, or cyanologists financially or with materials, and allow them to increase the capabilities of their members.
In return, he would obtain data on people who are willing to come to the country's aid in times of crisis, if necessary, and on their skills or material equipment.
Accredited instructors could also be available to assist the clubs and other candidates in training or education.
It also counts on organizing sit-ins with war veterans or people who have acted heroically.
One possible option envisages the creation of a new office in charge of administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal stress that people's participation should be voluntary, and the state would use their skills only after a state of emergency is declared.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual blurring of previously obvious boundaries between different types of threats," the intention states, referring to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministry officials noted that the focus should therefore be on supporting the widest possible range of capabilities, not just military ones.
"The fundamental objective of the project is to create a very broad base that allows each citizen to react skillfully to situations threatening the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect himself or contribute to the protection of others, and by behaving incorrectly not to make it difficult for the armed forces of the Czech Republic to carry out their tasks," the intention states.
Adopting the law would entail considerable financial demands.
The amount will depend on the option chosen, according to the ministry.
For example, the Office foresees financial support for projects to prepare citizens for national defense up to CZK 100 million.
If an administrative and coordination centre were established, it could cost around CZK 60 million a year to run.
More money would go to salaries or to build an information system.
The proposal also foresees that the scope of the regional military headquarters would have to be expanded, which together would employ an additional 42 soldiers.
Ministry officials have previously said that the law should also help resolve the opposition of some Czech politicians to the introduction of a European Union directive on gun possession.
Its adoption would allow the shooters who will be part of the system to keep some of the weapons prohibited by the directive.

Startups to help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the employee satisfaction of her e-commerce startup, but couldn't find a matching survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, unhelpful, or even misleading.
And despite promising the anonymity of the survey, some employees expressed their lack of confidence in the process.
"I was looking for consistency and objectivity," said Errett, owner of Madison Reed, a San Francisco-based hair care e-commerce company that employs 75 people.
So she asked for outside help.
New human resources startups are constantly appearing on the market to help companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing software with the specific intent of measuring employees' responsibilities, startups allow companies to conduct quick voting, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer complete anonymity of employees and a hotline for complaints, and in some cases also allow informants to bypass supervisors and contact directors directly.
"There are tools on the market like Strava and Fitbit that track your health, but where's the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Glint, a startup based in Reedwood City.
Errett said that Glint had made her more aware in three years of what her employees were thinking and feeling.
In addition to quick surveys and voting by specific teams, Glint offers a temperature map of the company and a cursory overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of managers with low ratings - allowing the user to work on a remedy.
Companies are beginning to recognize the need to heed the culture of the work environment - in case they become the next Uber - which is mired in scandals after a former employee published a post on his blog describing the corporate environment and harassment of employees who dare to speak freely.
For startups like Glint, the demand for surveys of corporate culture represents a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let's Talk Payments website, which looks at technical and financial progress, the value of the global industry of control, regulation and compliance may exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
Startup Convercent of Denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity at the beginning of the year, just before the Uber scandals.
Convercent's nearly 600 clients include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, he also took Uber under his wing.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable "flash" surveys, collect confidential real-time information, and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report improper behavior.
If the Director-General is implicated, complaints are sent directly to the Management Board.
"The court of public opinion has empowered regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent, a startup.
If a company is convicted of mishandling its employees or unethical behavior - and regulators fail to act - it could face costly consequences from customer boycotts, employee exhaustion, or lawsuits, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday Restaurant Network, which employs over 25,000 people across 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to raise employees' awareness of company policies and procedures and provide an easy way to contact corporate management.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report any problem, they had to trace a phone number or e-mail to the management of the company, formally file a complaint and hope for a successful resolution.
It was often a deterrent and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, general counsel for Ruby Tuesday, who said there had previously been no reliable way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, rapid detection and resolution of problems that previously never reached executives sitting in offices miles away from actually dealing with complaints - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment - is ensured.
"It comes close to a holistic, overall view of employee experience," said Vitrano, who manages the Ruby Tuesday group overseeing risk management.
"At the same time, we protect shareholders from litigation by employees."
Companies stopped taking ethics, values, and employee participation lightly in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed following the collapse of Enron in an abuse of employees' ethical rights, Quinlan said.
But it wasn't until "social media shone a spotlight on the whole thing" that companies began to realize that in the online world, they couldn't simply hide their skeletons in a closet.
"Before people started using technology to monitor the ethics, they relied on faith," Quinlan added.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of a service for which the companies pay regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity endorsed by the courageous equity investors who backed both startups.
As part of his February campaign, Convercent raised $10 million in total from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and eventually raised $47 million in capital.
Glint raised $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and raised $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing body of research clearly confirms that today's employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, the main advantage is not high salaries and interesting projects.
Employees want to perceive that they are being accepted and valued and that they are devoting their time to a company that is striving for a positive mission.
"If people are happy in their work, they perceive that their voice is heard, and that their work is rewarding, they strive for the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee benefits at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors make money if a company does well and companies prosper if its employees are happy.
And when an analytical tool comes on the market to ensure employee engagement and commitment to the company, it's not surprising that there will be plenty of investors to support the effort.
Work culture experts say it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is pointless unless the company takes the necessary action.
The fact is, once a company solicits feedback from its employees, there can be big changes.
And if change doesn't happen quickly - at worst, not at all - it can cause disappointment and disinterest in workers.
"Once you ask for 4,000 views, you have to be ready for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, director of consulting at Kotter International, who has witnessed many companies relying too much on data alone.
"Because once you don't get things done, the employees start asking themselves, 'Did they hear me?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, then why should I care?" "
Madison Reed, which now regularly surveys employees every month, can solve a problem within a day by using Glint, Errett said.
After gathering feedback from employees who were frustrated by slow decision-making and the quality of communication, Errett was able to reorganize several teams within the company and start communication training to successfully solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday is getting a very important look at its employees and hopes to achieve high employment in the long term in a field known for frequent layoffs.
"Unless you seek to create a transparent work environment, employees will not trust you," Vitrano added.
"And once you start losing employees, you lose customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole company goes bankrupt."
Thursday became the hottest day.
Thursday, with 38.3 degrees recorded in Strážnice, Hodonínsko, is the hottest day of the year so far in the Czech Republic.
It surpassed Tuesday, which was originally the hottest day of the year at 37.3 degrees.
The Czech Hydrometeorological Institute has been informed.
Compared to Tuesday on Thursday, however, there were not many heat records.
The heat mainly hit Moravia, with mostly clouds in Bohemia.
On Tuesday, records were broken or set at 35 of 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded a record.
Perhaps in Strážnice today's temperature was the same as the previous record in 2013.
In Lednice, Břeclavsk, today's 37.4 degrees surpassed the original maximum by four tenths of a degree, and in Pohořelice, Brno, the current 37.1 degrees surpassed the record by three tenths.
Both records, as with Strážnice, dated from 2013.
High temperatures today appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice, the biggest heat was in Dyjákovice on Znojemsk and Broda nad Dyji on Břeclavsk, where the mercury consistently climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not break the record.
By contrast, in western and northwestern Bohemia, for example, today's highest temperatures have been only around 22 degrees Celsius, according to the WHM website.
"Temperatures didn't start to rise there until later this afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually diminish, according to ČHMÚ, and there could be more significant rains on Sunday.
But in most parts of Moravia, temperatures will remain high on Friday and in the south-east of Moravia on Saturday.
We've had a lot of trouble around here.
Billionaires don't get the same vote in an election as every single adult in the country.
They want to decide directly, and because not everyone is as brazen as Andrej Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
The owner of Penta, Marek Dospiva, along with other colleagues across the water, Martin Burda and Antonin Fryc, sponsors Robezhka Realists.
The second life of the Civic Democratic Alliance is funded by insurance company owner and real estate entrepreneur Pavel Sehnal, who is also chairman of his party.
Convicted corruptor and king of Czech gambling, Ivo Valenta, has acquired the Party of Private People.
The Agrofert political movement, as Andrej Babiš's project was inadvertently named by the Croatian mayor Jaroslav Němec, is a chapter unto itself.
The mayors also caught their billionaire recently.
He is Dalibor Dědek, owner of the security firm Jablotron.
In his own words, he enters politics to do good.
But the Entrée in the mayor's jersey didn't go so well for Old Man.
"I've never dreamed of small goals," he told a news conference.
This means that my goal is for the Yes movement, for the Mayor movement to gain twenty percent in the elections.
A few smiled.
But the grandfather's slip is rather significant.
Billionaire Dalibor Dědek is a man of firm opinions.
While he plans to compete for votes in the Mayor's jersey, he continues to support Andrej Babiš.
The old man had supported Babiš in the previous parliamentary elections.
"Babiš is not a seasoned orator and does not rule by the pleasing rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote of him before the 2013 election.
But he's certainly not going into politics because he wants to do better personally.
For me, Babiš will remain a hero.
He's willing to step out of his world of control and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayors introduced him as a new recruit, he confessed his admiration for Babiš again.
And he said he wanted the Mayors to learn to imagine a possible collaboration with Babiš.
Some may appreciate that Old Man doesn't change his mind and stands his ground no matter what jersey he wears.
Others may speculate whether Babiš is sending someone this clumsy to the Mayor to build his B-list.
Others may wonder if the boss of Jablotron may have fallen out with the boss of Agrofert in bad trade, looking for another way to defend his business rival.
But Old Man's first public appearances didn't just revolve around Babiš.
The old man promised to send ten million kroner to the Mayor's campaign.
And if they needed more money, he would send more.
A few years ago, such a statement would have been hard to swallow.
Indeed, Zdeněk Bakala, a judicially recognized crook, was throwing millions around before the 2010 elections.
The political division of the security agency Víta Bárta, the TOP 09, and the Citizen Democrats together came in at nearly thirty million.
But these are different times.
The law prohibits anyone from giving more than three million to a political party.
Now that Old Man was entering politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Maybe then he wouldn't have to wonder why politics has such a bad reputation with us.
His first days in politics were crowned with a proposal to tax families with children under study.
College-educated people come to us for about fifty thousand a month.
Those with a base of less than 20.
A man of fifty thousand is rich by his standards here.
The one with 20 poor.
In Grandpa's vision of society, the poor pay their taxes fairly, and the rich enjoy the benefits of operating a welfare state in which they have little involvement.
The rich simply need to be helped to avoid poverty and hardship.
The mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition, and Babiš can rub his hands together.
The rest of us can confirm, thanks to the Old Man, that billionaires are not good people.
That leaves the question of who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who do not have the members and members of their party or the citizens and citizens of the state as their employees and the country as their property.
Finally, those who want all people to live well in a rich country, not just some.
No one wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex must have fallen by 234 million.
Selling real estate is sometimes not easy.
And it's often not helped by 11 bedrooms, a spectacular sea view, or the fact that the property is being sold by US President Donald Trump.
On the sale of the villa complex Le Chateau des Palmiers, the price went down by a whopping £8 million.
Mirror.co.uk reported.
The brochure says of the property, "Sincerely, Donald J. Trump."
Escape to a place like no other.
But even the real estate company's connection to the US president failed to justify the extreme price tag.
Donald Trump has had to cut the price of his Caribbean mansion by a whopping £8 million.
The original price of the property was £21.5 million, with the final price falling to £13 million.
Even after the discount, the villa complex is worth about 76 average apartments in the centre of Prague.
And it's not surprising.
The stunning 5-acre mansion on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin has 12 full bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, multiple dining rooms, a gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The grounds also include a swimming pool and tennis court.
Dozens of palm trees are planted on the property.
The terrace has a spectacular view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the price was influenced by the fact that the connection to the president was not sufficient to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to normal house prices on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid around £15 million.
He was to buy the property for rental purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin.
But with the new price, it ranks second.
The property in the neighbourhood was valued at £13.5m.
The NCAA has decided to end two practices a day.
As 11 a.m. approaches, UCLA's U.S. Soccer players crowd the sidelines of the new school field.
Some of them take off their jerseys to reveal sweaty backs, an unmistakable sign of the first day of training camp.
For most team members, these few minutes of idleness substitute for a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will retire to their rooms after a three-hour workout to study for their final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.
"These guys are going to have a tough time the next three days," said Bruins coach Jim Mora, moments before Monday turned into Tuesday.
By eliminating two practices on one day, the NCAA wants to relieve the players - ironically, practice days are even longer - at least until Friday, when the final exams are over.
That's why UCLA's first three practices are scheduled for 7:15 p.m. - to squeeze into the already crowded diaries of many students.
For the first time in Mora's six seasons as coach at Westwood, Bruins training camp starts a week earlier than last year, and practices are limited through the summer semester, with the decision to limit the number of practices from two to one a day also having a bearing.
In total, eighteen practices are scheduled until August 20, after which formal preparations begin for the first game against the Texas A&M team, which takes place in September.
Mora let it be known that he supported the NCAA's decision, even though it added another item to the players' already-busy schedule.
"The players are under a lot of stress for three or four days, and it's very exhausting for them," Mora said.
"But nobody's given up, everybody's trying.
I think things will calm down on Saturday when we have more time."
UCLA will be closed after the end of training camp, which will not be easy when looking at the bright lines of surrounding grounds from the adjacent parking lot and the luxurious Luskin Center hotel occupied by the players after harvesting the protective net behind the goal post.
Bruins players should occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora acknowledges that when the rooms are emptied during the season, there could be a problem.
"The property will be guarded by security," Mora added.
"Safety is taken care of, but it's not impossible that someone can rent a room and record our training sessions.
Such material is well traded.
Fortunately, the hotel will be guarded by security, as well as parking lot 8.
We will use our resources to the maximum.
I believe all will be well.
It's all planned."
Asked if the magazine's direct policies will discourage potential advertisers, editor Poore says, "I don't know, and I don't care.

Facebook plans more thorough fact-checking to limit the number of fake news stories
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to third parties for inspection and display findings under original posts in an effort to combat so-called "fake news," the largest social network said Thursday.
The company writes in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes, which it will send to third parties for verification and potentially display survey results below the original posts.
Facebook has been identified as one of the main sources of fake news, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports influenced the election of the President of the United States last year.
In Europe, political debates are taking place over the matter. French voters are inundated with an avalanche of fake news about the presidential election in May, and Germany plans to fine the social media network in advance of the September elections if it does not promptly remove angry posts.

"In addition to viewing third-party authenticated messages, people are asking for more content to be better informed and to make the right choices about what they can share," Sara Su, Facebook's product manager for news, said on her blog.
It added that Facebook was continuing to test the 'related articles' feature and was also working on other changes to reduce the number of fake news stories.
Creating a graphic novel: the story of A Castle in England
Scotney Castle, a small castle, recently played a starring role in the band's music video, Squeeze, and Margaret Thatcher also found refuge in it during the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney witnessed 700 years of stormy history from his cozy spot by the Bewl River in Kent, Britain, which inspired the curly-haired Jamie Rhodes of York County - known for his fondness for historical documents - to create a graphic novel.
"The sight of the writing of a man who is 300 years dead fascinates me," Rhodes says with a straight face.
"When I hold a letter in my hands, I feel a personal connection."
The graphic novel A Castle in England documents the lives of the families who lived in Scotney Castle from the Middle Ages until the Eduardo period, each story illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
But this is not Rhodes' first book inspired by the archives: he is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection inspired by British Library documents - a project that was very emotional for him.
"I was intrigued by the thumbprint on a letter written by a double agent in the '70s who worked for the Jacobites," he said.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because in those days you had to light a candle to read.
When I smell the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm going back in time.
How I love archives!"
For someone who is so fascinated by old papers, the support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and being able to stay in the castle for almost four months is almost like a dream. ("To tell you the truth, I've extended my stay a little bit.")
Rhodes spent his time researching the Victorian "new" castle, going through archives and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of a hyena on the wall and bottles that had been dumped in a ditch for centuries.
He wandered around the grounds, examining the ruins of the old castle, talking to gamekeepers, gardeners and, occasionally, artists who worked on the illustrations for his book.
At night he would "drink whiskey and write."
The confidential history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust did not gain access to the documents until 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived at the site a decade later, the employees were just beginning to break into the archives, which Rhodes described in terms of "aristocrats of many centuries throwing their hands around saying, 'Take it to the attic.'"
Diaries, letters from the days of the British Empire, maps depicting fortunes: "You may think the land dispute is boring," Rhodes said, "but there was one case where two families fought over a birch tree.
Stop it, people!"
Some stories in the book use the castle as a springboard and delve deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves a newly built castle to join the English Rebellion of 1381.
"I found a record of a riot at the castle in 1380, which in the book was called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," Rhodes said.
"The English rebellion actually began in this area, and it occurred to me that the rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe they're connected after all."
The other stories are firmly linked to the castle's history - for example, The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priest who was hidden by Darrell's family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, about an 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled a coffin with stones (which wasn't discovered until years later after the coffin was uncovered).
Rhodes's favorite family are the Darrells: "I was intrigued by the male race - the men at the time were always in debt, spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Different generations of the Darrell family dealt with it by marrying rich or old ladies - handsome gentlemen, I imagine, who were fond of turning the heads of heiresses.'
With his stay at the castle over, Rhodes searches for more adventures.
He had recently returned from a two-week stint in the Finnish wilderness, where he was soaking up inspiration for his next book on Elämänmäki, a former sanitarium from the early 20th century that had been swallowed up by nature.

"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I thought, 'Now get the hell back to real life.'"

Sex robots are on the rise - we should be on the lookout
Just when it looked like 2017 couldn't get any more bizarre, a report comes online about the technological evolution of sex robots.
Yes.
Sex robots are really popular these days.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a statement on the development of sex robots within the next five to ten years.
In the words of former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and FRR co-founder Noel Sharkey, the rise of sex robots must be viewed seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the nipples and the appearance of the robot's nails.
"People make fun of them, but sales are up and we need to be prepared to see them more and more," Sharkey said on the occasion of the report's publication.
Modern sex devices change from inflatable pan to silicone-skinned robotic women, which are pleasantly warm to the touch - artificial intelligence that mimics human behaviour is a matter of course.
The user can 'customise' the robot in his own image - from the colour of the eyes and the shape of the nipples to the appearance and colour of the nails.
Very disturbing, however, is the fact that many robots have their own "personality" that would put even the Stepford Wife to shame.
Modern inflatable dolls have evolved into silicone-skinned robotic women.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set different character traits for his surrogate wife, among them shyness.
And then there's the sexual robot woman Roxxxy Gold to True Companion, which is delivered with pre-programmed personalities, including "frigid Farrah," which features a shy disposition and a "wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" disposition.
"The Roxxxy Gold personality is set to suit your personality to the maximum extent possible," reads the True Companion website.
So she likes what you like and vice versa.
She's even moody, just like people.
She can be tired, talkative or "in the mood."
The rise of sex robots is alarming for several reasons - not including substitution for real interpersonal relationships. What is worrying are rather inferior female character traits and violent innuendo - such as the frigid (read defiant) Farrah.
On its website, True Companion likens Roxxxy to a vibrator for men.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why can't a man have Roxxxy?" the page reads.
But sex robots are not mere fetishes or sexual aids.
Their emergence and near-perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply ingrained in our culture - a shift away from ideal or gender equality toward a desire for compelling sex with an optional premium.
Of course, most men don't buy a robot woman, and while the FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain on the fringes of the general public's interest.
But this marginal interest may become the mirror set by modern times.
And most people aren't weird or violent until the free market gives them an excuse to do so.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots are emerging at a time when women around the world are winning their rights and there is a president in the White House who is often very derogatory about a woman.
The most horrifying aspect of The Handmaid's Tale is not what we see - hanged bodies and gouged-out eyes, but rather the reality of these visions.
The Book Draft The Handmaid's Tale is a step in the right direction, but at the moment it seems to be a small step.
Sex robots are supposed to resemble real women as much as possible (albeit with the measurements of a porn actress).
Their creators construct them to be pleasant to the touch and to appear at first glance like a real woman.
But when it comes to their “personality,” a robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just walk away.
They have no job, no history, nothing to inspire their independence or interfere with their devotion to their master.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.

NBA star on the green arm.
Curry is fighting for a cut in California.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry has not lost his way despite a botched first tee shot in the premier start among professional golfers.
The two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Award winner played a 74-shot first round in the lower Web.com Tour at the Ellie Mae Classic in Hayward, California, and will fight for the cut.
The Golden State quarterback, who won the Warriors' second NBA title this season, got off to a very nervous start, his first shot ending up in a beverage holder in a golf cart parked by the fairway.
Even then, he was not as accurate between the holes as he was under the basketball hoop, yet he left a dozen professionals behind with a four-shot lead over par.
"It wasn't the ideal way to start, having to call the umpire right after the first at-bat, but then it kind of clicked," Curry said, noting that a lot of stage fright had fallen on him.
It was very nerve-racking to hit the first shot of the tournament, but it was everything I'd hoped for.
"If you told me I'd play 74 in the first round, I'd take it immediately," he added.
If Curry can make it through the cut, which will probably be set at two shots under par, he will become the first representative of another sport to do so on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now that I've got rid of my stage fright, I think I can do that," said the enthusiastic golfer, who has played in celebrity tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
He starts in Hayward for the first time in a tournament that falls under the PGA.

Trump's big victory?
Against this, Mitt Romney is the embodiment of common sense
Political divisions are becoming an unmistakable sign of the Trump era, dividing the American electorate and, on a micro scale, tearing apart entire families.
Over the Christmas and Thanksgiving period, American newspapers were abuzz with advice on how to deal with relatives who vote for Trump.
Supposedly, we're just waiting for our nerves to give out.
But less attention is paid to Trump's ability to bring families together.
I'm talking about it because my cousin came to visit me in New York this week - a poet and fan of the left who lives in Chicago and who has been in our family for a long time paying for a Republican chump.
She reminded me that togetherness in the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, the whole family - including all the Republican siblings she'd been bickering with about politics for years - is suddenly on the same page.
At dinner at the family table, this is a good thing; but it strikes me that, in the wider context, it poses a significant risk.
Trump strengthens the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we refer to the terrifying possibility that his antics may one day become less attractive.
But there is an even more horrific long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” right-wing Republicans who, defying his standards, will suddenly be the embodiment of what you might call rational.
In these days, I remember with nostalgia in my heart Mitt Romney and his version of a crazy act - a dog on a car roof, a 14% income tax (at least we were aware of his tax return) - both of which look like very mild offenses compared to Trump.
With Trump gone, it will be enough for the subsequent Republican nominee to be at least normal, an immense improvement.
We took advantage of my cousin's visit and took the kids to Central Park for the biggest carousel run by the New York City Parks Department - you won't find a better use for your $3, unless you need caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the central cylinder is covered in fiberglass - clowns and animals are filmed staring at their shoulders in horror - a completely gloomy sight, and the tinkling music is oddly reminiscent of public transport.
Many clichés soon tire: the view from the high-rise buildings, the panorama percolates instead of breathing atmosphere on you, and the realness of the city doesn't get to your imagination.
Thirty-five years later, I still haven't gotten over the fact that Swiss Cottage isn't really Swiss cheese - not counting the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage - but a tube station in London.
Nevertheless, the carousel in Central Park produces a remarkably magical experience, to the extent that two two two-year-olds, as well as two mature women, have a great time on it.
If I could rate the carousel, it would earn maximum points, but fortunately no one asks.
I had a similar experience at the store this week when I was asked to rate my "experience" on a scale of one to five when I paid with a credit card.
It's the same at the coffee shop on the corner of my street, except I can throw in a 15% tip for something I buy behind the counter.
Not only does this slow down otherwise fast sales, but the waitress is thus forced to curry favor with shoppers when there is no need.
The woman in the store apologized with a smile as I reluctantly appraised my handing over of a five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius has had to be taken to hospital.
Last year he was treated for cuts to his wrists, which the prison said were self-inflicted after a fall in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after appealing the original manslaughter conviction.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 with multiple gunshot wounds through the door of a dresser at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he mistook her for a thief.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the trial would take place later this year.
If successful, Pistorius faces a sentence extension of up to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, a captive panda has given birth to a cub that has mated in the wild.
This is a huge success for the panda rescue programme.
The center is seeking to expand the gene pool of captive pandas.
Centre worker Zhang Zhzhong told the New China news agency that panda breeding is at great risk from inbreeding.
There were only 471 pandas in captivity at the end of last year.
Only two thousand survive in the wild.
Trying to mate captive pandas with wild ones is thus the first step in helping to conserve the species.
Cao-tsao, 15, was released into the nature reserve at the beginning of the panda mating season on March 11.
With a tracking device on her neck, scientists were able to observe her every step.
She met her chosen one, Cao-tsao, 12 days later.
The sexual encounter with the male panda lasted a minute and a half and was successful.
This, too, can be considered a minor miracle, since male pandas are not considered the most successful lovers of the animal kingdom.
Males misjudge the time when the female is ready, plus they are often confused and have no idea what to do.
The baby was born healthy and, even though Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, weighed 216 grams after birth.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams less.
Two Bulgarians were detained for camping illegally in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists on the territory of Greece for illegal camping, comments quoted by bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were detained in the early hours of August 1 by Sithoni police.
They were all released the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said to bTV that the Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free camping and impose stiff fines on anyone caught in a place where camping is not allowed.
Checks will run all season.
The Ministry said the court could impose a fine.

I still want to catch 10 years.

It depends on whether he gets an engagement before the start of the new year.
What were the four years you lived in Latvia?
If I had to rate it as school, three.
I didn't catch much the first year, I had an experienced goalscorer in front of me.
I was learning.
The second year, I started catching.
Before the third season, I thought they'd give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalkeeper, with whom I took turns again.
Last year, I assumed I'd be catching all the time.
But we only got, like, five points in the opening 10 games, so the coaches started shooting it.
By the end, my colleague was catching more.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play it for next season.
How was life in Riga?

It's a small Prague.

In Zlín, Roberts Bukarts has asserted himself, and before the contract is signed, Ralfs Freibergs.

It's a natural direction.

Then it was a classic.

Doesn't that make you nervous?
That was four years ago when I walked out of here not knowing what was coming.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand I am home after a while.
I caught something in the KHL, so I'm taking it differently.
The only question is when and where I sign.
How real is the possibility of starting the new year in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what happens in a month, where everything develops.
Now all I can do is wait and see what the agent says.
Do you prefer a contest?
The past season hasn't been one for me to choose from.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
The government's fling with Flight continues.
In January this year, in an article with the care of a proper housekeeper, I wrote, among other things, about a camp in Lety u Orlík.
The nature of the problem remains the same, so I will allow myself to recall the article's core passages.
Camp in Lety has been talked about for many years.
For readers who don't know exactly what's going on, it's probably best to take a look, for example, at the official site of the cultural monument Pietro Place Lety.
There, in the introduction to the historical overview, they learn that the camp was two kilometres east of the village of Lety, that from 8.8.1940 it served as a labour camp, from 1.1.1942 it was a collection camp and from 2.8.1942 it became a gypsy camp.
The following describes the course of life in the camp, including inhumane conditions, until March 1943, when the first prisoners of Summer were included in the Auschwitz transport.
On May 4, 1943, 370 people were transported by the largest transport to the extermination camp.
The total was 420.
A very sad history of the immense hardships of human beings, inflicted upon them in turn by human beings and perverse ideology.
There is no disputing the need to be constantly reminded of these events.
Nor is there any dispute that the commemoration should take place at a memorial at the site of these people's lived suffering.
The problem is elsewhere.
Under socialism, the camp was somewhat forgotten, and in the 1970s a pig house was built near and on part of the former camp.
The camp's history was accidentally discovered in 1992 by American Paul Polansky, and in 1995 a memorial was unveiled in Lety.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy back and demolish the pigs, but it has not yet done so.
In 1998 the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its management has been under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the piggy bank.
So many very brief facts about the post-war fate of the camp.
It was not until last autumn that the government approved the purchase of the pig and decided to have an expert report drawn up to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy the pigs.
According to Culture Minister Herman, "there are some numbers, but I would probably thwart those intentions if I went public with them."
We'll see what the expert opinion brings.
By some unofficial estimates, it could be hundreds of millions; by others, it could be as high as a billion.
Either way, it's not going to be a cheap proposition.
Yet, just a few hundred yards from the former camp, there is a memorial in which the state invested nearly ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the entire transaction was funded by the UN Human Rights Committee, which seems unlikely, I think it would still be a waste of money.
Doesn't the government have other priorities?
The monument, a dignified place of piety, stands by the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of a tragedy, and anyone who wants it can bow to the memory of the suffering and murdered.
I see no reason to change this!
Let's leave it as it is and keep the drinking place with the utmost care.
The assets entrusted, that is to say, the taxpayers' money, should be treated with care by the responsible person, in this case the government of the Czech Republic.
At least one like his own company!
Of course, the finance minister and deputy prime minister are not the whole government.
But even so, from the perspective of the above, I see the 'yes' leader's slogan only as an empty campaign proclamation.
In May this year, I went to see the place.
Very decent driveway, landscaped parking lots, replicas of wooden camp buildings.
In one exhibit, in the other an integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheatre with seating and views of its own drinking spot, which is made of rocks placed on a gentle slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes commensurate with the significance of this place, as befits and proper.
Archaeological research is currently underway at the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider, for example, the possibility of preserving some of the exposed foundations and making them at least visually accessible in an appropriate manner.
Culture Minister Daniel Herman could stretch his efforts in this direction.
If he succeeds in pushing through a government buy-out of pigs with state money, it will be yet another unfortunate step in his already troubled tenure as culture minister.

Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
But a new study suggests just the opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases.
The incurable disease, which affects up to 1.3 million US residents and 300,000 patients in the UK, causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are typically reminded not to eat meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms, but researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in a protein helps to create immune cells that promote intestinal resistance.
Study leader Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells protect the gut and ensure the breakdown of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
When the scales tip to the side of inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can occur.
As part of the research, researchers found the presence of body-tolerant immune cells in the stomachs of mice with a particular bacteria.
This bacteria requires the presence of tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to make cells.
Professor Colonna said: 'We found a link between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a common part of the gut microbiome and the development of cells that promote body tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had.”
At the same time, he suggested that if the same turned out to be true for humans, a combination of L. reuteri bacteria and a diet rich in tryptophan would help develop a more tolerable and less inflammatory gut environment.
Post-graduate researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwaso, as part of a study of a type of body-tolerant immune cells, discovered that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of the same mice bred separately lacked the cells.
She deduced that one group of mice had a different gut microbiome - a community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of mice were tested by DNA sequencing, and researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells that the second group of mice lacked.
Mice that were bred in a sterile environment and lacked an intestinal microbiome - so they did not develop this kind of immune cell - were given L. reuteri bacteria - and developed immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers grew L. reuteri in the fluid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - bacteria-free - to undeveloped immune cells that were kept in isolation.
Immune cells evolved into tolerant cells.
After removing the active ingredient from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of the tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-acetic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of mice, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent. At the same time, the number of cells fell by half after splitting doses of tryptophan.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us keep L. reuteri bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known if tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in tryptophan-related genes have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added, "Each of us should probably strive to develop these cells because they control inflammation of the internal surface of the gut.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri bacteria may increase cell populations.’
Jose Mourinho regards signing Nemanja Matić and his transfer to Manchester United as 'genius'
Manchester United have recruited a "genius" to their team in the form of Nemanja Matić - or so Jose Mourinho believes after the midfielder made his debut in Wednesday's game against Sampdoria.
Matic, who has signed a £40 million contract, featured in the first game with a 2-1 win in Dublin - the last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup, where United meet Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impressed in his reserve role alongside Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereiro.
However, having not taken part in the team's pre-season Asian tour, Matic was out of form and had only played 45 minutes, which Mourinho says needs to be worked on before the start of the next Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he is experienced, intelligent and has a brilliant mind - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get fit as soon as possible."
Like Matic, his new team-mates Victor Lindelöf and Romelu Lukaku have also played their first match at the Aviva Stadium and Mourinho is slowly shaping his 11 for the next season.
An independent source reported this week that Mourinho still wants to sign three more players, but insists the club has done a "fantastic job" and brought three of the four most important players into the team.
'I thank the club for helping me recruit three of the four players,' he added.
"Four out of four would make me happier, but I admit they did their best for me."
The Chicken Skin King's Life Challenge Ladi Pear.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
The multi-promising picture began to take shape thanks to a new programme on TV Prima Zdeňkov Academy.
Pear immediately sniffed a chance.
"Dear Zdenek, I'd like to join your cooking academy with this because, hand on heart, I think I can learn a lot from you," he said in a social media video.
And since the two had been tiptoeing for several years, Lad remembered to irritate him this time.
"In return, I can teach you znojemska from diet chicken, American cucumber, or invite you to water and show you why fried cheese is popular," said Pear.
He's really serious about participating in Pohlreich's new show.
It's time to move up a level and learn from the master.
"The question is what the boss says," he told Lightning.
But Pohlreich didn't comment because he was filming new episodes of his next show Yes, Boss!.
Only Prima responded to Pear's participation in the culinary academy, saying that she was treating the matter as a personal activity of his that went beyond television.
The big blow was dealt by Pear to Pohlreich in December 2004 with his first cookbook.
It sold over 300,000 units in a matter of days!
The new show, presented yesterday by Prime at a press conference for the autumn broadcast schedule, is a genuine cooking school.
Pohlreich selects his pupils from the audience and introduces them to 12 cooking techniques in 12 episodes.
In the last episode of his show Now Cooking Boss in November 2014, Zdenek had a crossed-out pear pressed into the back of his shirt.
If my face was in there, I'd laugh a lot.
"I just smile at the pear - the pear is a healthy fruit and has plenty of vitamins," said Lad.
She thinks highly of Lad's culinary prowess.
"Cooking according to Ládi Hruška is not an option at home either, because I won't let my gastropunk go home," the boss is clear.
I have a lot of respect for Zdenek Pohlreich, even making honey chicken according to him.
His recipes won't show up on my show, though," said Pear.
He's an asshole!
He's not a chef to me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomic illiterate or moron," Pohlreich said of Pear in a lecture.
"I'm not in my twenties to be able to wave them away, but I don't deal with them that way, either," said Pear, in the account of the insults uttered.

White House prop cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
The White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter to the South Lawn for last month's celebration of the American manufacturing industry came to $24,000, according to Navy records published by TIME.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter, also called Marine One in the presence of the president on board, was the highlight of a July 17 program at the White House that showcased American design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and several senior White House officials surveyed a parade of products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut helicopter was displayed next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
A White House military officer issued a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, requesting the presence of a helicopter less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn as part of an "emergency," said records from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - the unit responsible for managing the helicopter.
"I wanted to make sure you were aware of such a significant event," the HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his superior, the Navy's deputy commander for aviation the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7:00 p.m. on July 17 to mark the parade, scheduled to begin at 3:00 p.m. and remain in place until the complete clearance of the entire site, which had been planned between 6:00 and 9:00 p.m.
The email went on to say that if there was a delay in departure from the White House, a replacement crew would be dispatched for the return flight due to working time regulations.
The original crew remained at the scene that evening, along with a helicopter and a unit of security personnel.
The records - obtained by TIME - did not show whether a second crew had been dispatched after all.
The Hatch Act prevents government officials from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating a possible violation of this regulation.
"We were wondering if this was a violation of the Hatch Act and were assured everything was in order," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you've been blocked," the second-in-command wrote back.
This "Made in America" parade was designated by the White House as an official event, and thus would not be covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
In attending the event, the president pushed for health-care reform that was moving through the Senate and talked about trying to rein in government regulations.
The use of air vehicles such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when they travel.
However, their presence purely for presentational reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered the check in February after the presidential plane taxied in the background at his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida. his Twitter account is abuzz with complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessors.
"The White House is pleased with the "Made in America" show, which featured products from all 50 states made by Americans from American materials," said Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often practice landing in the Washington area and on the South Lawn, practicing possible arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump was attending the G-20 summit in early July in Germany, HMX-1 made 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight to the Made in America parade was part of the crew's current training, a state official said.
The helicopter unit flew an additional eleven hours in "non-presidential support missions" on the same day.
The White House said no additional props were paid for with taxpayers' money.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company had no involvement in the negotiations for the helicopter's display on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights, and the exact cost of the parade is difficult to determine, the Navy says.
According to the Defense Department, the hourly cost for fiscal year 2017, reimbursement of DoD expenses for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Unit records indicate a time of 30 minutes from Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of the helicopter are well below that amount.
"Putting taxpayers' costs on the basis of estimates for reimbursements is very misleading," Walters said on the matter.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual costs."
According to the 2015 RAND study, refunds for DoD expenses do not include personnel costs, but do include fuel, maintenance and contracted costs.
Then-White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the parade.
"The idea of this week's show is to introduce products manufactured in the U.S.," Spicer said.
"I am aware that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut take great pride in the fact that they contribute to the defense of our state, and that they provide jobs for hundreds, if not thousands, of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we pride ourselves on the helicopter and the other military installations that countless American citizens are involved in making.
It is appropriate to recall that fact.’
It's unclear if Trump was also looking at the helicopter when he made his rounds on the South Lawn, and all that can be said for certain is that he got behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back at the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky's representatives and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I own three myself."
A young woman was stranded in a swamp at Mac's Lake, with police wading in.
The girl started for the beach around 2 a.m. on Sunday.
Instead of bathing, she was trapped in the wetlands.
When she decided to use her cell phone to ask a police officer for help, she had the last 12 percent battery.
"That's why the officers soon lost contact with her," police spokeswoman Ivana Baláková said.
Several police patrols rushed to the scene she approximately described, but finding the young woman was anything but easy.
"Some of the policemen had to wade through the reed marshes for hundreds of yards before they felt solid ground beneath their feet again," Baláková said.
And so was the missing person.
The cops were oriented by which direction her call for help was coming from.
"To avoid losing at least that connection, they arranged with her to count aloud," the spokeswoman said.
Officers did not find the woman until a quarter to five in the marshes of the Borný site.
She was on the verge of physical and mental strength and showed signs of hypothermia.
That's why an ambulance called took her to a Cheshire hospital.
Grandpa's STAN connection?
A desired bride becomes a saleable girl.
That's kind of ironic.
With his web project, searchemeslusny.cz, the billionaire seemed to be essentially telling voters that STAN was suffering from a deficit of decent people.
And he also affirmed that a politically disparate bunch of more lesser-known mayors and independents actually had no national agenda for the House elections.
Her election candidate just happens to be a decent man after an interview with the Old Man, whatever his political opinion.

The newly created French app is free to download on the Secret Life of the City website.
The main goal of French programmers was for as many people as possible to contribute their images to the app, thereby increasing the number of plants the app could recognize.
"Already children who can hold a tablet or cell phone in their hands can go into the forest," said Ivana Polackova, coordinator of this project.
Based on a good enough photograph of a flower, leaf or fruit of a plant, the application can recognize its name in seconds, which it then assigns under the photograph in both Czech and Slovak.
The French have allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech for the Secret Life of the City project.
It is therefore welcome for users to contribute a snapshot of a plant not yet present in the database after setting up an account.
"The French will assess whether it is beneficial and then add it to the database," Polack reported.

GMB concerns over investment in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The union is seeking assurances from managers at biscuit manufacturer McVitie's about a long-term commitment to produce at the Glasgow plant.
The Scottish GMB union said the company was silent for the time being about a potential investment in a factory in the Tollcross area.
More than 500 employees work at the factory, producing Hobnob and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.
McVitie's owner, Pladis, said it had invested more than £5 million in the whole area over the previous few years.
It added that employees and union representatives would be "among the first to know" in the event of changes to the plant's operations.
In a letter to the company's manager, the Scottish GMB union expressed its concern that McVitie's "will not receive its promises to fund and modernise production lines."
GMB chief organiser Drew Duffy added: "The fact that we have not had a clear answer from the site manager about the needs of the company and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very worrying for our members.
Generations of many families have worked here and the staff are mostly from the local community and the Glasgow area, where working in a factory here is a critical pillar of decent employment in the area from high unemployment and social seclusion.
From the point of view of work, pay and utility - and despite the outlook for Brexit, rising living costs and falling slow production - the east of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous producer like McVitie's."
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "Construction manager Tollcross only received the letter from GMB yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible as we value the ongoing commitment to staff and union representatives.
A regular meeting with GMB staff and representatives in Tollcross was held two months ago and many issues were discussed openly at that meeting.
We have spoken to staff that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we assess our operations on a regular basis, which is true for all our operations, so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
It added: "In recent years we have invested £5 million in the Tollcross area, mainly in production lines and streamlining operations.
We very much appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and the site here, and in the event of any changes to the operation of the factory here, the employees and union representatives will be informed immediately."

Who will explain the sanctions?
Do political punishment have widely understood rules?
Donald Trump has nodded to anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the US imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
And a day earlier, Trump had written that China was doing nothing about the North Korean threat and that it would not go on.
That, too, makes the idea of sanctions sound like the straw from a shoe.
You can't lump those things together.
Maduro's Venezuela has indeed set out on a path toward dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China is merely not behaving as the US president would like.
Russia is a chapter unto itself.
But to sum it all up so that even the ordinary voter, American, European, or otherwise, understands what it is, and what system of rules underpins the policy of sanctions, would make the task almost impossible.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump is merely putting the finishing touches on what President Obama has already prepared, only to put an implementing stamp on it.
So why all the fuss?
Last year, Europe was terrified that if Trump won the US election, he would embrace Putin and lift the sanctions.
A terrible thought.
In practice, however, it's the opposite.
With Trump, sanctions are tightening rather than relaxing.
But Europe is even more terrified.
German Minister Zypries says Trump's sanctions violate international law.
As in kosher only sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then the EU's anti-Russian sanctions are not kosher.
Meanwhile, European Commission chief Juncker complains that Trump's sanctions threaten the EU's energy security.
You mean they're supposed to use sanctions just weak enough not to put anyone at risk?
The ordinary voter fumbles.
For three years he had heard that the fate of anti-Russian sanctions depended only on the implementation of the Minsk ceasefire agreements in Ukraine.
Now he's learning that it's about the EU's energy security.
The voter is also groping wider.
Sanctions are coming to Russia for over-assembling where it shouldn't.
China is being scolded for not installing enough.
Venezuela's president is being punished for building a dictatorship within his country's borders.

Andrej Babiš: I'm not considering working with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš is married, crisscrossing the Republic with his visionary book and finalising the election programme.
Apart from the Pardubice region, she also has all the candidates ready.
He did not, he said, interfere in any significant way.
He even agreed to have the Moravian-Silesian leader and the shadow education minister YES, Ivo Vondrák.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be an MP or a general," Babiš confirmed his earlier position.
You've upset a lot of incumbents and national politicians with your thesis that directly elected mayors and mayors should run municipalities and cities on their own, with only managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I am a fan of direct democracy, we elect a president directly, and I believe that we should also elect mayors and mayors.
I'm not talking about disrupting incumbents in my book, they might as well be there.
The question is, how many will there be?
In the presentation of your book What I dream of when I happen to be asleep, I heard with my own ears that you spoke of the abolition of councils.
I don't remember.
I was talking about direct election and reducing the number of incumbents.
New York, with a population of nine million, has five districts and 51 incumbents.
Prague, with 1.2 million citizens, has 1171 representatives.
And the Mayor is blamed for not building enough and preparing big projects, but she doesn't have the authority.
The same is true of a government that has been run by only two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
Which is not to say they did it well.
But the current prime minister is not in charge, he is merely moderating the debate.
That can't work.
Is that why you want to impose a majority system?
He'd be ideal, but it's hard to get through.
All we have in the program is a change to a one-vote Senate race.
We have also proposed a sliding-scale ministerial mandate and an amendment to the House Rules to avoid unnecessary exhibitions by MPs, who are supposed to work mainly in commissions and committees, not show up at House meetings.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents fear.
That as a dictator, you will run the government, control the 101-member House, abolish the counties and the Senate, and control the country through grateful mayors and mayors.
It's definitely not like that.
There's nothing wrong with debating the number of MPs.
President Macron of France has announced a reduction of the legislature by a third, while there are 57,000 Frenchmen per lawmaker, compared with 17,000 Czechs for us.
But no one accuses Macron of threatening democracy.
Even if someone wins elections by a majority in the Czech Republic, we have mechanisms to prevent them from making any dramatic changes.
But the temptations for whoever has a parliamentary majority are great, just look to Poland or Hungary.
There is no danger of that in the case of a Yes vote.
We just need a team that works for the people in government, not for their parties or resorts.
I don't understand why we couldn't agree that only the salaries of teachers, employees in culture and social services would be increased.
Why did they overrule me and add 21 percent to the GIBS who already take 60,000?
Is that what you would do as Prime Minister?
The prime minister is supposed to intervene when ministers behave wastefully, confusing the government with a travel agency, and with the state's money they would like to do business like Marian Jurecka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers are not supposed to quarrel in government, they are supposed to settle their differences outside it.
Finished material must go to the cabinet, there is no room for coalition infighting, force votes and business, that is where decisions are to be made.
How are you going to have a cohesive team if ministers behave mainly in a partisan way?
There's a constitutional law above the parties.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said the coalition agreement did not apply and fired Babiš from the government.
Any prime minister can do that.
But if he is a personality and has management skills, there is no need for such idle gestures.
It measures everyone equally and requires perfect performance from everyone.
Do you know who you'd nominate for Secretary of the Treasury?
I don't think about it at all, we probably won't even be in that government, nobody wants to work with us, even though I don't know what I did that was so terrible.
So much scepticism is misplaced.
The mayors have recruited businessman Dědek, who would like to work with you, with the Peoples, he may win the wing of the leaning Jiří Čunk.
I don't think so.
The ČSSD is led by Lubomír Zaorálek, who is not ruling out a coalition with YES, and Vaclav Klaus Jr., who also won't be opposed, may make it in the ODS.
I'd leave it to the voters.
Deputy Prime Minister and Vice-President of YES Richard Brabec said you have many points in common with Tomia Okamura's SPD, for example on the economy.
So the ocamura are an option as a coalition partner?
Mr Brabec says he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has a political history, running as a puppet of Vít Bárta for the VV, then raising money from the Dawn for his company, there was some kind of coup.
He is, of course, a distinct personality.
A little brownish, though.
If I take his agenda, there's a broad involvement of people in the management of society, direct democracy, I can agree with that.
That's not what I'm asking you.
I wonder whether a man who has xenophobic views, speaks at gallows demonstrations and wants to leave the EU is acceptable to you?
We're not considering working with Mr. Okamura's party, I can't imagine.
Clearly, he went into politics to profit from it.
What about the tacit support of the Communists for your minority government?
I can't even imagine that, but the voters will decide.
It's going to be about negotiating the winner with the second in line, but God knows who's going to be the winner and who's going to be the second.
Of course, it is important that they are able to agree on a coalition government agenda.
Let's get back to your quest to run the state like a business.
But the government just has to follow suit, Prime Minister Sobotka let it all go to waste, he never made a decision.
Coalition issues like CEB or EGAP didn't work.
After all, Sobotka is his puppet, and I think that's why he fired me.
Once he did, ČEZ took control of the Czech government.
It is incredible, after all, that the Prime Minister has brought a resolution written by the management of CEZ, which instructs the Finance Minister how to vote at the general meeting of CEZ.
If you become Prime Minister, will you change the personnel situation on the Board of Supervisors and replace the senior management of ČEZ?
Jesus, if I'm going to be prime minister, we'll see.
I'm not one yet.
Rumor has it that CEZ has already sent signals your way.
He would like to exchange a good collaboration with the CSL for an even better one with YES.
Maybe after the election, things will go on.
I don't know anything about it.
I don't have a Humble lobbyist or a Rosie, I'm a separate unit and I don't deal with this at all.
Then answer directly.
If you head a government, will you seek to replace the leadership of CEZ, Czech Television or the General Health Insurance Company, the institutions you criticize?
I would like CEZ to be a transparent company.
So far, he's done what he wants for years, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
All you have to do is track down Mr. Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although the state has a major in CHEZ, it has never driven it, it has only been there in numbers, which is wrong.
To me, it's a trivial matter.
CHEZ is supposed to take the Dukovans, value them, stick them in a subsidiary, arrange financing, do a supply competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The concept that the state should finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
And Czech Television?
Some of her shows are running a permanent campaign of convenience against me, but I have not and will have no authority to fire anyone.
But control, yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay about 7.2 billion a year in public radio and television fees, but they don't really know how these institutions are run.
How do they not know?
After all, the House approves the report on their management, which has a direct effect on the positions of the CEOs of ČT and ČRo.
Look at how the news is being discussed, the Sobotka Kalousek super power pact that has always worked.
This is true of both the current parliamentary commission on leaks from investigation files and lex Babiš.
And Sobotka was stupid enough to let Kalousek push me out of the government, which threw in the TOP 09 percentages, but the GOP took them away.
They fear the disruption of their corrupt system, so they talk about the threat to democracy by Babiš.
No one is immune.
What do you say to articles describing how the first vice-president of YES, Jaroslav Faltýnek, builds a power base by putting his son on the supervisory board of Tepláren Brno and arranging for a related lawyer, Květoslav Hlín, contracts with city and state firms such as Prague Transport Company or Czech Railways?
We have a permanent quarrel there.
I don't like it, and I've reproached him several times.
The Falcons argue that the lawyer in question works at significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't go that way.
As treasury secretary, I had no one.
We, unlike the socans, never had a corruption affair, no Pelta, Kratochvilova, Březina.
If there was any hint of patronage, we immediately fired such a man.
I am uncompromising in that regard.
If something like this happened, we'd get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who they were.
The Commerce Department reported that, adjusted for inflation, construction costs did not change in September.
