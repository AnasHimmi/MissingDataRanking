Design Vibrators cost tens of thousands.
"The Czechs are not Pruderní or conservative," says Martin Ráž, who runs the Prague boutique of intimacy.
It features designer and luxury erotic gadgets.
Including those from Czech designer Anna Mares.
It started quietly, about twelve years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friends went to cycling trip in Moravia.
One of them had not only brought the bike, but also a box full of remarkably-looking vibrators.
"Different krtečků and delfínků and everything was green and yellow, and quite different," he tells me over lunch.
His friend, with one of his companions, decided to work with the German producer of the Fun Factory design erotic gadgets, which Martin was interested in, and so he offered to help with marketing.
When the companion left to pursue another profession, he replaced it.
Today, it operates a boutique of intimacy in the Prague Street, where he sells erotic aids in the manner in which luxury handbags or shoes are commonly offered.
And why not?
These are also design items.
Wait, wait, you're having fun at lunch, you think?
Come on, don't be such a puritans!
Just the Berlin Fun Factory Shop, designed by the acclaimed designer Karim Rashid, served for a boutique of intimacy as an inspiration.
They opened it in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic commerce than the one they are used to.
No hidden expenses, everything done in beautiful, decent style, products exhibited more like in perfumery.
Martin and his business partner, Zdeněk Šebelkou, began to wonder how to hold the Prague trade where he should be and how he should be named.
The name of intimacy pleased both.
"It's related to intimacy, and it's too, you can say, tender," he says.
It followed the purchase of an Internet domain and the search for a suitable space, which was parallel with various visualizations of the interior.
Finally, a variant was won, which laid out a shop in the garden of pleasure and a bedroom dominated by a bed.
Dagmar Štěpán from the studio of FormaFatal prepared it for us.
We found the space in 2013.
At first he did not feel completely perfect, because he was not on the main street, but he was therefore sitting in the name of intimacy.
He's intimate.
It's in the alley next to the main one, so nobody neokukuje customers, "Martin Ráž praises.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to make a trade that will be different, with branded nice goods, in an environment where women who are mostly our customers feel good.
And not to styděly for having entered such a trade.
When I was in a boutique of intimacy half an hour ago entering, the streets Zela emptiness.
Besides, I didn't even feel like I was going to a shop with erotic aids.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior, which I know from fashion boutiques.
Even if there's only a woman's service in the shop, women neostýchaly to ask for help doesn't mean that a man's leg won't come here.
Mostly, gentlemen come to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
"Men tend not to guess the right size and choose larger," Martin smiles over a common mistake.
These are the prejudices, the conventional cliché that women need some great aids, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith chooses an unnecessarily big vibrator.
Likewise, men choose a mostly black underwear, whereas a woman usually gravitating to pink color.
An absolute bestseller is the product of the aptly called Satisfyer.
From the expression in my face must be clear that I do not know which beats, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
This is such a touchless stimulator of the clitoris.
In me, the adolescents are uchechtnouted with admiration for what serious tone I am being given.
It's like Nechumelilo.
And it actually nechumelí.
It's at a good price and has a perfect user reference.
We didn't believe it would be so well accepted.
It's a recent revolutionary novelty.
The first revolution caused the vibrator in the shape of a seahorse.
He took care that women became more interested in the design of such products.
The second was a vibrator for the pairs of We-Vibe.
Completely zbořil taboos, which may persist in some men, and that they see competition in erotic aids.
"They do different variations," he continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with remote control.
This is a popular category.
In a love affair, a woman may have a control in her hand to determine the intensity of the vibration.
On the contrary, a certain parachute is a category of loading vibrators.
At least with us.
Czech women, it seems, prefers multipurpose gadgets and buy classic vibrators, although they need to be used only externally.
It is very popular in Western Europe, especially in younger customers.
What about men?
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
It would have to be a little different.
The question is what men offer, "Martin considers.
"We also have aids for them, but to a limited extent." Most is sold mainly masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It does not look like an anatomical imitation of the vagina, but "more like a shower gel or as an egg or futuristic object.
It focuses heavily on functionality and experience in use.
In Japan, this is completely different.
It gives me astonishment.
I thought the Japanese girl had a lot of sex on erotic aids, I think.
"This is the internet reality," I explained.
The mundane is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more likely to be associated with being used by women.
In Japan they are perfectly normal for men, and on the contrary they are taboo for women. " Just for interest-what the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented in the intimacy boutique, sells worldwide, still accounts for roughly half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
Czech and Czechs are not pruderní.
On the contrary, we are a fairly accommodating nation.
Certainly unlike countries like Catholic Poland and Italy.
The typical business client is between 35 and 50 years old and "He has some experience both with sex life and some aids.
He will come for something nice, better quality, to be added to the partner life, or to himself. " To return, Martin Ráž and his business partner, Zdeněk Šebelkou, care to ensure that they are perfectly functional for each product.
We also do not want to engage in specialties of the type bondáže and latex, because we do not have space, firstly it is not suitable here.
Such things could discourage those we are trying to target.
Which are the people who have always had shyness into the sex shop to go because they were afraid of having something like this peeks.
A lot of products exhibited on shelves are really appealing.
It is also a selection of renowned brands.
Some of them even earned Design prizes, including the Red Dot design Award.
The first award-winning was the Seahorse "and this triggered a change in the whole industry.
It began to jettisoning from cheap materials and, on the contrary, to work with disabled non glue, began to produce different designs, different colors...
It is pleasant that the design of some stands Czech, namely the popular designer Anna Mareš.
I have to say that I was quite pleasantly surprised how many people have in our design things Whoop. de. Doo from Anna Mares buys, although they are relatively more expensive.
There are customers who go directly to Venus balls from Anna Mares.
She has done a really huge piece of work by presenting in the Czech Republic and abroad exactly what we are trying to present – that erotic aids can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Annin story began as a school job.
Now it is a finished product, which is also produced by us.
I wanted to have the production process under control and I also wanted to know from what materials and how to Whoop. de. Doo produce products.
Because it is not a Velkovýrobu but a small series, it is certainly more costly than a large series.
Maybe I'm a little upstream, but I find it important to keep up with us in the Czech Republic.
It may well be that in a few years we will not be able to produce anything, "describes the situation of Anna, who agrees with Martin that our company is becoming increasingly open.
He does not meet with negative or dismissive attitudes.
Most people are embarrassed.
"But they'll start smiling, too." Currently, Anna Mareš has a vibrator on offer that you can get a personal message on, and this year it also plans its own lubricant gel.
In the next year should accrue vibrating eggs and other news.
The boundaries of healthy sex
I wonder where the limits of what's fine.
Is there anything Martin Ráž wouldn't sell?
It's terribly hard to define.
What comes to one normal, another may seem utterly abnormal, so we are more defined by the assortment of branded manufacturers.
None of them are in any extrémností.
Before we say goodbye, I have the last question: what was the craziest demand they got?
Right now the week came an e-mail in which some Mrs. Poptávala masturbate a widget for her friend with a natural length of twenty-eight centimeters.
So we had to write that we had no such thing.
It's still a question of whether someone was kidding us, "Martin is measuring a suspicious look.
This, too, is becoming...

The Trumpova of the White House is now a statue of Liberty
The unmistakable sign of regime change is criticism of sculptures.
Americans could tell about it as well as everyone else-see the carefully staged overthrow statue of Saddam Hussein on Bagdádském Square Firdos in the year 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key proponents of Trumpova regime, certainly knew what to brewing when, in a passionate debate with CNN reporter Jim Acostou, on President's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigrants, he set out with a symbolic axe to Statue of Liberty.
It looks like Miller didn't attack the statue.
It would zlynčoval him a crowd of boat owners and imitators of the Statue of Liberty.
But he attacked its significance, namely the fact that in 1903, a plaque was placed on the pedestal with the famous poem Emmy Lazarus, up to 17 years after the monument was completed.
Miller rebuked Acostu by saying, "I do not want to embark on history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that sheds light on the whole world.
The poem, which has been placed additionally on the pedestal, is not part of it. "
Miller's really right, but as he said, it's not about history.
These are mainly the striking words of Emmy Lazarus, who resonate today-inviting them not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poorest: "Let me go, who kles, who the poor, who can barely breathe, who beggarly the worm in the midst of full cities."
And just in modern times we can better watch these "abject worms" on our screens.
Miller did not try to critique poetry-he wanted to clarify that these people are not welcome in the US.
This conflict about the significance of the statue is part of a comprehensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict about the significance of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends, who, after her death, sought to plant a plaque with a poem on the statue's pedestal, knew quite well that it was deserted into a high political game.
The statue was meant to express the connection of the French and US Republican governments by representing the classical theme, the feminine embodiment of liberty.
Emma Lazarus has changed this meaning: In her poem, a woman's character is not abstract, but has her own voice.
It also has a very different name: Mother deportees.
Merging a poem with a woman's picture is a brilliant feminist thrust and devastating attack on the American Nativismus.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, the followers of the right have long sought to reverse this significance.
A well-known commentator, Rush Limbaugh-John the Baptist in the matter of Trumpovaing to power-in 2010, he argued that the Statue of Liberty in fact nezve nobody into the country, but represents the early Neokonstruktivismus, the bringing American flame of the underdeveloped world: "The Statue of Liberty Vykračuje forward.
He brings the torch of liberty from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The torch does not illuminate the way to the United States. "
Limbaugh surprisingly hints at an important thing.
The significance of the sculpture depends on the angle of view.
Emma Lazarus describes a statue from the perspective of an exhausted and damned passenger who, often after a long and terrifying voyage across the ocean, arrives with hope in his heart to the new Earth.
It is literally a view of the world through the eyes of people seeking refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this perspective, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that, of course, is a perspective that Miller and Trump definitely recognizes.
Their torch is not to illuminate the path, but to rozněcovat the hatred that is their only source of power.

World Championships in Athletics 2017: Neil Black pěje Praise to the Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when the British team had only two Scottish members
The Director of the United Kingdom Athletic Federation Neil Black said that the strong skvadra of the 16 Scots in the World Championship team will be "a huge benefit for the team".
For the London 2017, which starts on Friday, a record number of Scottish athletes was selected.
Black believes that in Scotland "something special is going on" and British Athletics could ledasčemu learn from the Scots.
"We're trying to understand and adapt – we'll work on it," said Black.
"I talked to people from the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has to do with what they've done.
The leaders of Scottish athletics think it has to do with what they've done.
British Athletics: It has to do with what they have done.
People on the streets also think so.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing. "
Several Scottish athletes will seek medals, including Laura Muirové and Andrew Butcharta-who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at the 5000 m race, while Eilidh Doyle was elected as captain of the team.
"Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing, "Black said.
"Several athletes, whether Scottish or athletes of other nationalities, came out of the room with a sense of immense pride and motivation.
The passion and Neskrývané of the feelings with which the Eilidh spoke were unrepeatable. "
The silver Commonwealth medalist who will compete in the run over the hurdles at 400 m at its fifth World championships said it is "unbelievable" that the British team is 16 Scottish athletes.
The previous record from the year 1983 and 2015 is seven.
The runner-up on the middle tracks Muirová set only five British and two European records in the last year.
On the MS will participate in the run at 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who will run the track at 1500 m. This season he won British team races and annual games.
Doyle remembers his first mastery, which was the only other Scottish member of the team, Lee McConnellová.
The captain of the team led her to be "very proud" on the fact that the team received not only a large number of her colleaguess, but in many cases they will also attack to participate in the finals and medals.
"The extraordinary team captain is that I was elected by other members of the team. It was a great honor for me, but the knowledge that the team members chose me is all the gratifying, "she added.
"I'm obviously very proud of all the Scots who got into the team.
It proves where I moved.
They are athletes who will be confronted on the podium.
And my introductory speech?
Yes, I think she did.
I only drew attention to the fact that we can be proud of this year's championship because it takes place on home turf.
It is important to use the support of domestic fans and rejoice in the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got a second chance to race and enjoy the incredible atmosphere. "
Block critiques on Facebook: neucházejte a public job if you don't take criticism of voters
The father of our country knew his criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers did not take long to criticize it for anything, starting with domestic politics and ending with his political views.
Yes, this criticism nenechávalaed him cold.
But he didn't try to silence the critics.
Because in the year 1783 Washington said: "Freedom of speech can be repossessed – and stupid and dumb we will be guided as sheep for slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland is governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work to act like Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted posts at least 450 people who freely showed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
This week, the American Union for Civil Liberties sued him for these acts.
The staff of the Governor rejected the action as gratuitous, and in the comments on the Internet appeared many opinions of the type "who cares".
"It's just Facebook," many users reported.
Still, it matters.
Especially in the moment when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolute democratic state, this is an immensely popular Republican governor.
It can boast the second highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan is not popudivý.
As evident is, his state drives with certainty his own and strictly adheres to principles.
It turned out to be also maneuverable in using Facebook as the main means to connect with its voters – the exception is not even the publication of the first photo with a bald head after graduating chemotherapy.
Blocking people who visit the Guvernérovu page – which is a public forum designated as official and managed by its employees paid from taxpayers ' money – is useless and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post Hoganova, the spokesman Amelia Chasseová defended the governor, saying that the blocking of comments took place from the post moderation.
However, using an image of Internet trolls, spamerů or angry people is too easy.
The Washington Post quizzed a few real people who have deleted posts.
And exactly they are-real people who speak to their elected leaders; Teacher, entrepreneur and pastor, no trolls.
As everyone mentioned, their comments were polite and considerate, not profane.
The Pastor quoted the Bible in his commentary, apelujíc the Hoganovu Catholic faith.
The lawyer of Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramaniová, Md. Asked about hate crimes, but her commentary was not hateful.
"I politely remarked that I was disappointed by his lack of response to hateful crimes and other topical news," she wrote in a section with comments from the Washington Post.
"I don't like the idea that once a certain number of people comments on the same subject, some people are identified as the collective effort to promote, instead of being recognized as a larger group of interested citizens."
What the governor's employees called "concentrated spam interest" would probably call them "defense."
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage posts by blocking criticisms or deleting negative comments.
It is much more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would require workers to be posted to the streets, where they would collect and burn all the prints with criticism, or would be arrested or silenced by Protestants.
And that is exactly what is happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public official to be criticised for insulting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump faces an action by Twitter users who are denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
The chairwoman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment in Alexandria, according to the district Judge James C. Cacherise, where prevent access to one of the voters on her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also had a visit from ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that difficult.
In the Times of Washington, the low postage price had practically the same impact as the Internet.
Between the years 1776 and 1800, the number of daily newspapers quadrupled and his position as leader Zpochybňovalo many anonymous writers.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to newspapers and questioned Washingtonova decisions.
According to historical documents gathered by people within the online project papers of George Washington project, in his office accumulated petitions criticising his opinion against the deal of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, disagreement, and intimidation lie in the very foundations of our nation.
And the real leader has to accept it.

The number of minutes in roaming has risen to double from a year ago.
Germany is dominated by a huge margin over other countries.
"Roaming calls are used by business customers on business trips," added Ronald.

Poverty and death in the Indonesian country of gold
When Bardina Degeiová cooks dinner, he does not use the cooker.
In fact, it rarely uses a saucepan.
In its wooden shack, located in the capital of Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, the woman usually simply throws a sweet potato-in the speech of the local "Nota"-directly into the fire.
After half an hour, she cuts out the potato and tastes with her nemytýma hands with gusto.
Bardina sits on muddy land-the cottage is not equipped with furniture-where he also performs his daily work, such as. Wash the laundry in the water from the nearby swamp.

As the youngest of four wives of her husband, she was not assigned any field to cultivate.
Polygamy is common here.
Late-night Labor is a danger: Most of the village's men are unemployed and often drinking alcohol. In addition, the village is home to soldiers.
"In the afternoon after five o'clock, no one will allow themselves to wander around the village," says Bardina.
It is a rare insight into everyday life in the highlands of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote in the form of public upheaval before Occupying army.
The current movement protesting against the Dutch rules quickly reversed its anger against the Jakartské government, which dominated the entire region with the exception of foreign journalists or civil rights supervisors.
In the year 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua-independent Papua new Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a distant and ravaged city, which can be reached after a ninety-minute flight from the capital of the Jayapura province to Nabire, and then pětihodinovou the stomach forming an ride.

"We only wore leaves before."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia-28% of the population lives below the poverty line, and children's mortality and literacy rates are one of the worst in Asia.
At the same time, it is an Indonesian country of gold.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world of Grasberg, which owns the company Freeport McMoran of the American Phoeenixu, is located only 60 miles from Paniai-Rocky province about the size of New Jersey, which is home to about 153 000 inhabitants.
Only in the year 2015, Freeport extracting gold and copper worth 3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua supports logging at an estimated value of 78 billion.
These riches are, however, a Papuánce source of suffering and a guarantee of oppression from the mighty Indonesian army.
An investigation by the New York Times in 2005 shows that Freeport paid local military officials and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including 150 000 dollars for one officer.
Papuans calling for local authorities threaten this golden goose and are therefore hard to potlačováni.
According to human rights activists, more than 500 000 Papuánců have been killed since 1969, and thousands of others have been raped, trýzněnoed and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.

"It is difficult to count the number of casualties, because the incidents occur every week," said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian research fellow at Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation přitížil the fact that Papuan sources attract colonists to Indonesia.
From 3.5 million inhabitants, the province is 83% Christian, but demographics are changing with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands-Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.

Indonesian President Joko Widodo, dubbed Jokowi, promised a solution of inequality and violation of rights in the 2014 presidential campaign.
The former carpenter secured and its journey to the presidential palace in Jakarta 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But very little has changed in Papua, and local people feel betrayed.
"Our heart was broken because in the year 2014 we voted for Jokpwiho with the hope of hearing our call for justice," he said.
The fact is that just two months after the October inauguration of Jakowiho, Paniai experienced a great shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang Christmas songs at the campfire in the town of Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers on motorcycles emerged from the dusk of the night.
Two of the surprised children told them that they should turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers made this complaint and the tone that was spokenly touched and later returned with four other soldiers, said the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers in the drunk state persecuted a group of children and beat uped them pažbami their weapons, they reported the victims and witnesses to the events.
One of the soldiers then fired on a group of children.
One of the children, 16letý Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so heavily that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later someone had burned the nearby building of the Electoral committee, and the next day things were still escalated.
About 1000 young Papuan men and women gathered on the football field in front of the local police station and the army headquarters and demanded justice.
They came with welcomes hunting bows and performed the dance of Waita, which runs in a circle and mimics the singing of birds-the Papuánského tribe of Mee Pago.
Several Protestants began throwing stones at the building.
With the stupňujícím of tension, the soldiers were ordered through the radio: "If the crowd tries at least three times for resistance, you have permission to shoot," it sounded according to TIME magazine in an official document, whose content was never published in the local media.
Yeremias Kaya (56), the head of the Enarotali Kego Koto District, recognized the impending dangers and called people to break into their homes.
But no one had heeded his words.
"When I turned, someone shot me in the left wrist," he told the weekly TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kaya still does not know who was the scorer, but according to his words, the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people all around, and there was a lot of shooting," he added.

Three weeks later, Jokowi delivered a passionate speech in Jayapuře, and expressed his understanding for the families of the victims and promised to deal with violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem, so that it could never be repeated," he said.
In October 2016, the Wiranto National security Minister announced that it would introduce an extra-judicial mechanism to resolve violent acts that have occurred in the past.
Almost immediately, however, the excuses began to reverberate.
"Most violent acts have occurred a long time ago.
Some of them occurred in 90. Years of the last century and some at the beginning of 21. Century.
I mean, we're committed to punishing these violent acts, but it won't be a simple task, "he said.
In an interview from 5. June for TIME Weekly, which took place in Jakarta, however, Wiranto argued that it does not plan to introduce any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said that "all cases will be Předstoupeny court".
The Wiranto, which the UN accused of "crimes against humanity" on the basis of more than one thousand deaths during the independent elections of 1999 in East Timor, said that there had been urovnáno 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, including the incident in Paniai.
Families of victims of gunfire in Paniai welcomed his assertion with distrust.
"In the last three years I have been internedočkaled a total of four times, but so far I have nothing to do," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
As he says, several years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army arrest me or I'm being shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many inhabitants of Paniai, who are afraid of the incident to speak.
In his words, he beat uped the members of the Army after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After the burial of the bodies, the army began to look for me," he said.
And shooting so far neustává.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot at the villagers in the neighboring Deiyai.
The skirmish, in which one person died and another 17 injured, occurred between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to provide assistance in transporting a man unconscious to a hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24), who drowned while fishing in the nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested in front of the company building.
According to the police, the villagers threw up the stones, and their response was a warning of gunfire.
The locals, however, claim that the Mobile brigade (Indonesian Paramilitaristická police) began firing into the crowd and killing one man.
"There was panic, we were afraid of retaliation," said for TIME 29letý Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the injured.
"I didn't come out of the house for two days."
Deiyaiský Parliament craved the punishment of participating police officers and the withdrawal of a mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai was always a thorn in the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of indigenous peoples of the tribes of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the central Highlands.
Many of them joined the Liberation Movement, Papua (OPM)--Army rebels, which protects the rights of Papuánců by attacking and kidnaping Indonesian policemen.
Some of the OPM leaders come from Paniai. They are among the not Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Goya.
As a result of the attacks the army in recent years has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of inhabitants of Paniai, all under the guise of "securing national sovereignty".
Some of them no longer belong.
Paniai is known among the inhabitants of Papua as a "tragic and forgotten place".
Oil in the fire is pouring poverty.
The little rice that is sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
And bread is just as unachievable.
The locals have grown their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruits and wheatgrass.
Women work on fields; Each of them tills four or five sweet potato fields.
Most of the harvest is intended for family needs, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potato cost just 10 000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire airport has opened more routes and new immigrants have begun to flow into the country, there has been an increase in economic inequality between native Papuans and immigrants.
So few jobs usually occupy educated and wealthier immigrants.
Papuanss rarely have the necessary capital and education to embark on a business.
"Young people move from villages due to lack of job opportunities and money," said John Gobai, chairman of the Tribal Council of Paniai.
Thanks to the isolation, the province of Papua is hidden from the world.
It also contributes to strict rules for foreign journalists.
At the beginning of this year two French journalists-Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp-were expelled from Papua-because of the "lack of cooperation with the authorities", all despite the fact that they received such a rare permit for filming.
Phelim Local Kine, deputy director of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi promised to repeal strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development in his electoral campaign. However, this has never happened.
"Foreign journalists working in the rebellious nejvýchodnějších areas of Papua and Western Papua are at high risk: non-recognition of visas and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of reports from foreign journalists means that international pressure on Indonesian in Papua is largely limited.
In March Urgovalo six Pacific nations-Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands-the UN Human Rights Council on investigating "various and widespread acts of violence" in Papua, including firing in Paniai.
These countries have also supported the OPM in the past.
A spokesman for the Indonesian foreign Ministry, Arrmanatha Nasir International, shook off the allegations by declaring to reporters in Jakarta that: "There is still a democratic system in Indonesia and the media are free, so it is difficult to disguise evidence of human rights violations."
Local people call for the participation of foreign governments.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the envoy for Human rights Keesem Van Baarem, visited 4. May Jayapurau, the local people provolávali according to the source, who also attended the meeting, but wanted to remain anonymous, the motto "We Want Freedom".
For the year 2019, other elections are scheduled in Indonesia, but Papuans claim not to vote Jokowiho.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions but is surrounded by people associated with shooting in Paniai," said Gobau, chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the inhabitants of Paniai-except that they live in constant fear of the marauding army-are rolling in poverty, miserable education, and the health system.
Gobai argues that the inhabitants of Paniai, like the other Papuans, regard their vote as "debt", which must Jokowi repay.
"They don't want the money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the family's victims of Paniaiské shooting, they continue the last symbolic act of defiance: bury the bodies of the victims on the land opposite the police and army stations.
Knowing that justice will never be done enough, at least let, so that responsible persons forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," said Yacobus, his head tipping.
"What can we do?"

The survey results showed that more than one in five passengers to the USA carry prohibited items on board the aircraft
A survey among travellers showed that more than twenty percent of them were consciously or unconsciously conveyed prohibited articles through the U.S. government's transportation Security Administration's checkpoints on board the aircraft. At least six percent of the passengers came aboard an aircraft with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers claim to have belatedly found that they were traveling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey results conducted by Stratos Jet Charters Inc.-and more than 1000 behalf requesting-showed that younger passengers are more likely to be in violation of the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they tried to consciously travel with a subject that is banned by TSA, there were 19.7 percent of passengers with several thousand hours of flying compared to less than 15 percent of members of generation X.
The most common subjects that have leaked the attention of TSA include food and alcohol.
More than three percent of respondents knowingly made a sharp objection through security, while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the men surveyed also admitted that they deliberately carried banned drugs aboard the aircraft.
The company said it carried out research among travellers around the world to find out how many of them accidentally made unauthorised items through airport control and how much they did on purpose.
Unsurprisingly, most people who have transferred unauthorised items – whether consciously or unconsciously – are traveling by plane very often.
As the company underlined, the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often don't know what kind of liquid they can carry on an airplane.
It is no surprise, then, that the TSA seized in the largest amount of the forbidden liquid.
For some time people thought that the TSA would treat books in the same way as pašovaným goods.
The transport of liquids is permitted within domestic flights, not international.
Head of EPA Scott Pruitt on deferral of planned guidelines to reduce emissions of the Obama administration
After fifteen countries were sued by the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the former Obama administration's plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt introduced changes within its plan. It responds svižnějily than previous governments to the needs of national environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal challenge brought against his previous position in the Federal Court of Appeal.
This applies to the last deadline set at 1. October, when States should start to comply with the 2015 regulation to reduce the level of ground-level ozone.
In June, Pruitt announced that it would postpone the agreement for one year and order more detailed study of the plan to avoid "interventions with local decisions or impending economic growth."
Pruitt, who was the position of state Attorney General Oklahoma before putting up the role of head of CEPOL as President Donald Trump, served for a long time as a staunch opponent of tighter environmental regulations.
Since settling in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly movesed or delayed the regulation proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
A sudden turning point is the biggest legal failure for the PRUITTOVU regulatory agenda.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington decided that the EPA had overstepped its authority in trying to delay the integration of the Obama administration's plan, which required oil and gas companies to reduce methane leakage.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed its version of ozone standards and strengthened CEPOL's commitment to cooperation with States through complex processes and meeting new standards within a given timeframe.
"The government of the previous EPA administration often failed to meet deadlines and waited until it was sued by aktivistickými groups and others, souhlasíc with a settlement and further setting of plans," said Pruitt, who in his previous position filed more than a dozen lawsuits on the EPA.
"We do not believe in regulation by means of litigation and we take the performance of the term seriously.
Never nežertujeme of the status and authority that follows it. "
However, the EPA declaration states that Pruitt may use the "possibility of delay and all other legally available authorities" at some point to ensure that regulation "will be based on sound policy and most affordable of information".
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for obšírnější transcription of the ozone rules.
The White House budget, approved last month, has been seeking a delay in implementing the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The measure still failed to pass through the Senate.
A New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who was spearheading the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group wasn't going to allow it in legal coercion.
"The turnaround in EPA's views-following our lawsuit is an important victory for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans, who are directly affected by air pollution," added Schneiderman.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Washington, D.C.
Ground-level ozone occurs when common harmful substances emitted by automobiles, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power stations and other sources reacts in a solar atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive people and every year thousands of premature deaths.

"You cannot hide from the unexpected light, you cannot close your eyes," he described his sorrows.
Today, Christopheros has twelve operations that are far from the last.
Injuries suffered by acid attack victims may require hundreds of surgical procedures and years of treatment, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after demanding and long-term treatment, victims of tissue have scarred for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people do not recover, and they fight deformity and disfigurement throughout their lives," said Professor Peter Dziewulski, a spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic surgeons.
The attacker was mistaken.
As for the attack, Christopheros is certain that an unknown man had to confuse him with someone.
The offender believed that revenge was a man who sexually abused his close person.
The police thoroughly investigated the case, and the attacker eventually Vypátrala.
The man was originally sentenced to a minimum of eight years in prison.
But later, the verdict on the astonishment of the Christopherosovy family changed fundamentally.
"The three judges finally concluded that the punishment should be abolished, since the man is not considered a threat to the public," said Christopheros.

China lacks tourists.
BEIJING, because of visa policy, is losing billions.
For decades, China has been trying to exert its influence without the use of force funds.
Each year, it spends ten billion dollars in support of language schools and the construction of universities abroad, pushing its entertainment industry to foreign markets and trying to attract Western tourists.
That's not what Beijing is doing.
Its state media talks about the plan to make tourism a driving force for economic transformation and modernisation.
However, the number of arrivals rose only by 3.8 percent last year, and roughly 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.
This is due, among other things, that despite all of its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners with open arms, assesses the situation in the world's most populous country, professor of economics from Beijing University's Christopher Balding in an article for Bloomberg.
The Chinese visa policy is an example that speaks for all.
Only 13 countries have visa-free travel with China, and citizens of others have to take a visa in advance.
As a result, the Chinese authorities in the US are comparable to the celebrations of China's new Year.
The visa costs 140, but if one does not want to wait for hours in the queue, it must pay 100 and more for additional services.
Such restrictions build significant economic barriers.
The Journal of Economics and Finance has shown that the need for a visa reduces the country's number of visitors by 70 percent.
In 2015, mainland China was visited by only two million Americans, while Hong Kong, which is less than three per cent of China's gross domestic product, has visited 1.8 million Americans, living less than one percent of the population.
China often deepens this problem by using tourism to implement its political goals, such as in disputes with WAN and South Korea.
When China in the spring confined transport to South Korea within the split around the South Korean missile system, South Koreans it Oplatili and avoided China.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 per year, while Japan recorded an increase of 85 percent.
This affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recently published report by the US central Bank, the Fed may have left as much as 190 billion to China as a result of China's foreign journeys, and it will receive about 35 billion in currency sales to incoming tourists annually.
According to the official figures on balance-of-payments developments, China had a deficit of 217 billion in tourism in the last year, equivalent to 44 percent of China's entire surplus in trade in goods.
A small number of tourists, therefore, advocates a very painful blow to a country that anxiously defends the capital outflow.
But the factors mentioned above are only one manifestation of more general restraint on foreigners.
In many places in China, virtually no one has heard of immigrants.
Even in 2013, less than a million foreigners lived in China all over the year.
More of them have some individual cities in the United States.
Even Japan, which is not exactly the crossroads of immigration, has double.
Many scientific papers show that immigrants usually enliven economic growth, entrepreneurship, and innovation.
However, it is practically not found in China.
To solve these problems will be politically challenging, but the step that is being offered is to simplify the visa apparatus.
Other Asian countries, particularly India and Vietnam, have recently been making great efforts to simplify and cheaper visa-issuing procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.

The annual reconstruction of Moore's Ford Bridge has been organized for almost ten years by Cassandra Greene.
Her performance is figurative, engaging and concise. It shows deep-rooted racism that many would like to consider extinct in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction is not easy and even more difficult to avert sight, but Greene says it has its meaning.
"Nobody wants to talk about lynching, because we have to face the uncomfortable feelings that hide in each of us," said Greene.
"But there cannot be a relationship between us unless you listen to what I have to go through."
The main rehearsals of this year's reconstruction began in June and the very first day with approximately 30 actors-a dozen whites, the rest of the Negroes-flocked to the room where Greene met a very carefully scheduled performance.
Wade Marbaugh performs the position of Assistant director.
For many years he played the leader of the Kukluxklanu, but according to his words, the role is exhaustive.
"I feel bad about it because it contradicts who I am," Marbaugh said.
"I think it's very important to remind yourself about this part of history regularly, because we never want to go back to that time."
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play the role of Roger Malcoma, or Barnett Hester, practice their role.
The performance begins with a skirmish-Malcom argues with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get off my land n---E!"
Rascona.
Skirmish occurs.
At that moment everyone (at least each black actor) explodes in laughter.
Greene laughs the most.
"What happened?" Otážeed Rascona.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," leading Greene cheerfully.
"I just don't think whites were saying ' n-R ' in such a tone."
"Exactly," Vyhrkne one of the black-skinned actors.
"You have to put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; The enemy will replace the feeling of rapprochement.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic. Only to be done for enough four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
Rascona this time emphasizes the correct pronouncement of a word on N.
No one's laughing now.
The performance ends violently and quickly.
Roar, shots... and the Silence.
A woman dressed in black stands above the bodies of actors and Pěje Truchlivou the song Billie Holiday "Strange Fruit".
Every word has a feeling of sadness in the room.
In the background of all this, a dozen bystanders wipes sweat and tears from their eyes.
There are practically the same number of blacks and Caucasians in the audience.
One couple traveled from New York Ithacy, many spectators from the nearby vicinity.
Each of them tolerates the local humid climate for almost eight hours, and Brooks is in the crowd leading to the tombs of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until this moment, the murders could be viewed with a distance, but now, stojíc in the same place where the lynching occurred, the atmosphere is scary.
With the last words of the song, Greene will invite the crowd to inspect the bodies.
The children klekají to the heads of the victims, watching fake blood and immovable bodies, and whispering something in their ear.
"They're not dead," Utrousí the little boy.
Passes a few minutes and Greene would thank the audience. It's over.
The actors cleaned the rope and blur their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugha, a man in a suit played by the leader of the Kukluxklanu.
Nick Rascona embraces his two buddies-the actor and cries out in their arms; Finally, doléhají emotion.
"That's all right," whispered one of the women.
"We know you're in the same role.
But you had a reason for that. "
Later that day, the audience sits together with the actors for dinner.
At one table a young Bělošsky couple enthusiasm talking about a show with a black pair that they met today.
Denise Duplinskiová barely found words to express her feeling from today's performance.
"It is difficult to listen to those ugly words and look at those hideous deeds... which are held by people who look like you and do it because they look like you," she said to the reconstruction.
"It makes me realize that lynching is still a topical subject," she added, "just called police skirmishes."
On the other side of the room sits Tyrone Brooks in the courtroom. Relish dinner and talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he already began planning a performance for another year.
"The reconstruction of these events is inspiring, as it describes the fear that we had to relive — but it is also a moment to ponder," he said.
"Unless we learn from it, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and do not study the history of their country are doomed to repeat it. "

I love the instructions for use.
A friend of mine says that the instructions for use only read a chicken.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It is one of modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
With nostalgia I remember the times long ago, where the instructions for use of anything was rather a guests raritným phenomenon.
For example, my first gramophone had only one paper on which there were hieroglyphs depicting the wiring of some components, and there were some secret brands.
When something inside had gone wrong for years, I offered the document to a shaman who was not afraid to unscrew the back plate.
With grin, he told me what the paper with the labyrinth of lines was suitable for.
Yes, it was an accustomed aid in the chronic depletion of toilet paper.
He found a disconnecteding wire and allowed me to listen to the precious vinyl pancakes again.
The new time has brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where he simply held a cut grep, required about ten pictures.
A sketch with a description of how to insert one part into another was particularly useful.
The set was two-piece and another procedure was simply not possible.
To put it in reverse, it required considerable effort with the necessity of breaking certain plastic parts.
My disdain for the instructions ended at my Samohybu brand Seat Leon.
The year of manufacture 2003 still had such a book with instructions for minor repairs, among which were the replacement of turn signals bulb.
It was easy.
A total of three steps and work should have been done.
Unfortunately, the author of the manual neglected indicate that while the bulb on the right went to replace really only in three steps.
1. Take off the cover.
2. Crosshead a cracked bulb and našroubuj a new one.
3. Nasuň the cover.
The bulb on the left had a problem with the location of the battery cover.
At first I thought that by inserting the right upper limb into the bowels of the car našmátrám some spring, a screw, which redeployment the cover easily and then I will be guided by points 1-3 Economical author of the service book.

"How about dismantling the box?" the woman said the battery.
In sheer despair this occurred and then step 1-3 was as easy and fast as the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
And until the day my colleague called me, who was just sifting through the collapse situation after checking two úřednic of the State Department for Drug Control.
I know him as a balanced colleague who has experienced both possible and impossible in the field and who can interpret wild stories with an unruffled voice.
"Imagine that I was fined for not having the instructions for cleaning my hands," he told me in a faint voice.
Gradually I dug outed from him the whole problem, which was in the fact that there is no picture instructions above the washbasin in the toilet, how to wash his hands.
His argument to the Commission úřednici that adults usually wash their hands, and that the need for pictograms to master the accustomed activity of decent people had no healing effect and cost him a little money.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He understood that simply rinsing the palm of the hand with running water is a primitive act at the level of kromaňonce that a man of modern, Homo sapiens sapiens, performs this ceremony in ten steps.
For example, it is necessary to tell that water must be released from the tap.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end it is a joyful finding that one washed his hands exactly as he ordered Hosudar from SÚKLu.
Finally, I must say that I was inspired and preparing a detailed plan for activity in the restroom.
In question defecation is the procedure uniform, there the problem does not arise, for urination, due to certain differences of both sexes, it will be necessary to hang the guides two.
The problem remains with these pictograms, for it is possible to create a perfect procedure with a precise sketch of all the anatomical details, which could arouse a certain outrage at the prudérního visitor, despite the fact that he can finally learn that during his entire life Vytíral the appropriate hole in a completely faulty procedure.

Latest test results to determine the age limit of asylum applications in Sweden
The latest test results of asylum seekers in Sweden who have undergone a new method of assessing their age show that over 80 percent of people have been surveyed as being over 18 years old, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (RÃ ¤ Ttsmedicinalverket) started to perform new tests at the beginning of this year.
The objective of the method is to assess the applicants more precisely in the framework of the evaluation of asylum applications. The measure was accessed after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to determine the correct age of some refugees who were lying about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has forwarded 6880 cases to the investigation and the forensics agency has now published a total of 2481 tests carried out from mid-March to 31 December 2005. July 2017.
80 percent (2002) was considered to be at least 18 years old, while in a further 25 cases the forensic medical Agency considered that it was "perhaps 18 years or older".
In a further 423 cases, it was decided that the interviewee is "possibly under 18 years of age".
The tests are only accessed if the age of the interviewee is disputed.
According to Johan GÃ ¶ Ranssona of forensic medical agency results correspond with the previous month.
"As opposed to last month, statistics are held in a well-stocked dormitory, and the numbers are very similar," he said for the Local.
A higher number of applicants, whose age has been estimated to be over 18, does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers are lying about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and stated that in 442 cases it was found that "the questioned person is 18 years or older".
Newspapers Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the respondents said they would have 18 years of this year.
Critics also received a medical method of determining the age, which includes x-rays of wisdom teeth and an MRI scan of knee joints, which are then judged by dentists and rentgenologovés.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who, among other things, deals with judging the biological maturity of people to determine the age at which a teenager passed.
"I had reason to think about this issue and I don't think these types of measurements to assess age are correct.
The assessment of the biological age is, in a sense, very doubtful.
If we cannot determine the age with precision, we should not pretend otherwise, "he said for the Metro newspaper.
The Forensic Medical Agency agency's GÃ ¶ Ransson defended the decision by saying: "Generally speaking, the risk of an incorrect assessment of a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the questioned person is just below the 18-year threshold, which in this case corresponds to 10% of all respondents. "
Trump threatened the phone with the President of Mexico.
In a January call to Mexican President Enrique Peňovi Nietovi, US President Donald Trump threatened not to meet him if he publicly said that his country would not pay for the construction of a wall between the US and Mexico.
Trump in the interview said that funding will somehow arrange it, even if admitted that it will have to be secured from other sources.
Likewise, Trump has spoken openly with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbullem.
It results from transcripts of interviews published by the American newspaper the Washington Post on Thursday.
Trump made the construction of the wall on the southern border for Mexican money by one of the main promises in his last year's election campaign.
In the first interview with the Mexican president shortly after embarking on the position of Trump Peňu, Nieta undiplomatically chastised to build critically for his plan to build the wall.
He portrayed the southern neighbor as a growing political problem and pushed the Mexican president to publicly say that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't say this to the press," Trump said repeatedly in an interview from 27. January and threatened to interrupt contacts with the Mexican president if he continues to issue a defiant statement.
The funding is supposed to come out, and it will end well.
"But if you say that Mexico will not pay for the wall, then I do not want to be with you gentlemen, because it is unacceptable to me," he said according to the American newspaper Trump.
The wall called it the least important thing we're talking about, but politically it's probably the most important.
The executive order to build the Trump wall was released shortly after the takeover of power.
Mexico rejects the construction and financing of a wall of 3200 kilometers, vyhrotily the relationship between the two countries.
At the end of March, Trump said the project will still pay the United States.
Trump finally met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the July G20 summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also reported on the Trump phone interview with Australian Prime Minister Turnbullem of 28. January.
The head of the White House described the conversation as ridiculous.
To that end, it made him an exchange of views on the agreement that Australia would grant asylum to středoamerickým refugees in exchange for the United States to accept persons from internment facilities in the Pacific island States.
Trump thought he was a silly deal at first, but later he went on.
"I'm sure you can say that this is not the deal you created, but you'll have to stick to it," said Trump Turnbull.
In some passages, the telephone conversation with Turnbullem was almost jovial, for example when Trump appreciated as a good idea Australian refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats.
"You're worse than me," Trump joked.
But suddenly the tone of the conversation vyostřil.
"I hate accepting these people," Trump said.
I assure you they are bad.
That's why they're in jail now.
"They won't be great people to work for the local milkman," he said.
In an interview, he also noted that a fugitive could be a Boston assassin in five years.
Trump led at the end of January, roughly a week after coming to the White House, telephone interviews with a number of world statesmen, often several in one day.
The conversation with Turnbullem finally marked the least pleasant for the whole day.
Before he had finished, he emphasized that he had had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

When the police search the cellar of his house, he discovered evidence that the man had planned his deed.
Mr. Almatari described him as a creature.
What could have been his motive?
Even an animal would be more merciful.

"Rana disappeared in the afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the news and all our TV stations, the posters with her picture hung everywhere," he continued.

How the financial rules of football will affect the transfer of Neymar to Paris
The rules restricting the funding of European football clubs do not disturb the Neymarův record transfer from Barcelona to Paris-Saint Germain, France.
Any penalization for Paris Saint-Germain will be realized by the EUFA organization, which oversees the European football teams and has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
The rules of Financial Fair Play (FFP), which introduced UEFA in 2011, stipulate that PSG will have to demonstrate that Neymarův transfer was not financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros only to redeem Neymar from its contract, and Neymar would demand a salary of tens of millions of dollars a year.
The following are several financial conditions Neymarova transfer to France.

Clubs can spend a huge amount of money to buy players, but on the other hand they have to prove the legal sources of income, which allows them to cover the overhead costs of football-related business activities.
FFP was introduced by Michel Platina after being added to the chair of the director of the UEFA in the year 2007.
A former French player believed that clubs that would owe themselves in pursuit of new reinforcements would ultimately cheat and risk bankruptcy if the banks or owners refuse to secure them.
In 2011, the FFP rules rerouted their attention from club debts to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model that was used by Roman Abramovich with Chelsea in 2003-Buy a club with potential and spent exorbitant sums for the player Y to build a global brand-suddenly was not so advantageous.
Within the current three-year trial period, which will expire in 2018, clubs can report a loss of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platinum had to leave his post in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Čeferin, was determined to advocate a ban on excessive spending.

PSG took a fine of 60 million (82 million)-which was later reduced to €20 million-and an order to reduce the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is looking out for teams that can try to circumvent the financial regulators raising their income through companies associated with club owners.
While, therefore, the Qatar company sponsors PSG as soon as financing exceeds the value of the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the settlement of the amount.
A similar measure was approached by UEFA in 2014 after deciding that the amount of funds provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
Some of the Neymarových revenues in PSG could be reimbursed by some reports from the organisational commission of the MS football 2022 in Qatar.
However, PSG and Ms 2022 in Qatar have denied fat that Neymat should become an ambassador to the FIFA World Cup, and that such a maneuver would easily be revealed by UEFY officials.
Previous sanctions thrown on PSG mean that UEFA will closely follow any attempt to circumvent the rules,

The financial statements for the current financial year have not been published yet.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and selling jerseys.

The Bank of England holds the interest rate at 0.25%
The Bank of England, as expected, should announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, followinging lackluster economic growth and weakening inflation, which has stifled speculation about rapid growth.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain "in the background" in the context of maintaining interest rates--despite the squeezing of family budgets.
The political leaders of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of England voted six to two to maintain the interest rate at 0.25%. The results of the vote for the increase in the interest rate boosted the lackluster economic growth supported by the weak increase.
In its annual inflation report, the bank predicted growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that family budget reductions would continue. The bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in autumn.
At the same time, the bank indicated that, over the next few years, growth would be due to inflation caused by Brexitem, and it also said that the rent from renting should rise more than expected on the financial markets.
Members of the Committee also voted for the withdrawal of part of the mammoth package, whose task was to support the economy and which was put into practice a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result, the term financing plan, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, should start on the next February, even though the Bank of England said it would now offer £ 15 billion less than the planned 115 billion.
Just before the decision, the bank said: "The MPC predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term, with pressure on household real incomes and consumption burdens."
On the subject of rates, the bank said it would be necessary to "tighten money policy belts" to calm inflation, "to a greater extent" than the markets expect.
The markets are currently predicting the first growth in the third quarter of next year and a further increase in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any increase would be "gradual" and "limited."
The bank reduced the growth forecast for this year and next year compared to 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
The estimated growth of 1.8% in the year 2018 remained unchanged.
After the publication of the estimates, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 dollars and by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision to maintain the current situation came after the zklamavší increase buried hopes for further growth--GDP stopped at 0.3% in the second quarter, compared to 0.2% of the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it should be slightly increased by the bank's observations.
The latest inflation report is a slight consolation to households hit by rising inflation and lousy salary increases. The bank said the situation would worsen before the increase.
The report further states that monetary policy "cannot prevent" the reduction of revenues in the coming years, but the wages are expected to "significantly" rise to the end of the three-year forecast.
Economics should also rise due to the great interest in British goods due to weak pound, which compensates for a lower percentage of consumer spending.
This decision came a year after the rate was reduced to 0.025% in August last year, in response to a shocking vote on the EU referendum, which caused the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that the full unification of prices and economy will last at least four years.
Before the bank's decision on the latest rates, many demanded a rise in rates, along with rising inflation, which exerted more and more pressure on households. Three policymakers demanded an increase of 0.5% in June.
Inflation last month fell back to 2.6% from June's 2.9%, even though the bank said it had expected such a change, and inflation should rise again over the next month.
The bank said that the crossing relative to the 2% target was "completely" due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, it seems that competition in the mortgage market will only soar once lenders start competing for contracts with a look at a good view towards the end of the year.

NHS prescribes controversial HIV medication to 10 000 patients
Patients receive from September access to the ' transformative ' treatment for HIV prevention based on the Supreme Court decision on the funding of the NHS.
The English National Health Service (NSH) announced that the pill pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which is taken before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered through a health service of approximately 10 000 Patients within three years of the trial period.
NSH agreed to fund the probation period after the Court of Appeals supported the Supreme Court decision of last year with the statement that the NHS has financial means to pay PrEP despite a statement that the drug should be financed by local authorities.
The decision, which was announced on Thursday, was adopted by the NHS of England from the mouth of Simona Stevens's CEO as ' significant intervention ', while the National Aids Trust (NAT) decision described it as a ' decisive moment '.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to begin receiving patients. Other clinics will join in October and until April 2018 a full implementation across England will take place.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a HIV medication administered before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among patients at risk.
Pre-sex PrEP means that there is a sufficient amount of specific medication in the patient's body to prevent infection.
These medications can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Among the patients tested are homosexual or bisexual men, transsexual people and people with HIV positive partners who are not treated successfully.
The clinics will identify eligible participants who sign their consent to participate in testing, including men, women, transsexuals and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by the treatment.
People living and registered with GP in the UK can also sign up in their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential participation in testing.
The Program will come to the taxpayer at £10 million and the NHS England signed this week's contract to distribute drugs after obtaining an international public procurement.
The evaluation period is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: ' This important intervention should complement and fully factor the ever expanding and increasingly successful attempt to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than thirty years of trying to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health. '
Deborah Gold, executive director of NAT (National Aids Trust) said: ' We are witnessing a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is used properly and patients are at risk, it will offer a chance to transform an English HIV epidemic.
NSH will offer from September to patients who are at high risk of HIV infection a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and not subject to the necessity of persuading a partner, leading to an improvement in the quality of many lives.
We accept this statement with pleasure. '
Ian Green, Executive director Terrence Higgins Trust said: ' Number one priority must be rapid deployment of tests throughout the country; We must ensure its availability to any patient.
Now we have a trial drug PrEP and we are on track to protect more than 10 000 people who are at risk of HIV infection. '
The shadow Minister of Health Sharon Hodgsonová said: ' The beginning of PrEP's trial period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delay and delay by the government.
The evidence suggests how transformative can make this medication as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
Subsequent tests will lead us a step closer to fully understanding the PrEP benefits.
It is now important that we start the tests as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are exposed to HIV and thus end the spread of HIV in society. '

Life on the high leg: the mezzanine and clever design have transformed this little apartment into Earls Court in a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, exchanged a large house in Knightsbridge for a flat on Earls Cour in 2014.
Located on the first floor of the smart Terrace Queen Anne-A is an illustrative example of modern design, which uses the maximum available space.
"Before, I lived with my ex-husband in a much larger house in the Knightsbridge district," said Joanne.
"I've been looking for something more sensible price.
I stumbled upon this apartment in Earls Court and had the same height of the ceiling.
I fell in love with him, and I nodded to him the same day. "
Since then, the apartment has undergone a size of 1000 square meters complete renovation.
One bedroom apartment with a complicated layout-to get to the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen-the Joanne wanted to add the storage spaces and the mezzanine to use the high ceiling.
"I longed for a high ceiling, large windows and lots of light.
These were my demands, "she said.
To this end, hired Erfana Azadiho from design and design studio, Duck & Shed, based in Notting Hill, and used an almost čtyřmetrový ceiling to create a home that was not just a project but also a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such a height, so that two gaps could be climbed-the challenge for architects was to create a mezzanine on which to walk.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is quite complicated," he explained.
"We had to arrange both rooms so that we could walk upright.
It was not only to build a simple platform, but at the same time bend the steel structure so that at right height above and below the ceiling. "
This arrangement enabled Erfanovi to construct two full-fledged rooms on its own – and at the same time add to drama.
The mezzanine overlooks the magnificent living room of the old copper window frames in the design of Retrouvius.
The gold-coloured mirror, Silver Line, and Serge Mouille retro chandelier create a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in drama, Space and lighting.
The short corridor is equipped with mirrors on both sides and it looks so long.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window to another room.
Storage spaces with mirrors for storing cutlery and jars are located at the entrance door.
The advantage of the living room, which lends the impression of a significantly larger space, is the possibility of separating it from the kitchen, if not used.
Foldable kitchens are nothing new.
But what is unique about this solution is the folding door.
"We had to solve the technical side," Erfan speaks of the reinforced veneered doors.
"The door is equipped with a counterweight to odhrnovala very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Joanne has received another 16 square meters, second room and better overall layout of the apartment.
"When it comes to that, what you're selling is living space--the appreciation of your property," Erfan said.
"A real estate agent essentially when entering the apartment counts estimates its price on the basis of a residential area."
In this case, we managed to increase the living area while maintaining quality materials, which lend the space a luxurious appearance.
"The material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with your home," added Erfan.
"You won't love the wiring in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but your heart will not gain. "
As it turned out, quality design and increased living space can transform an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And like Joanne, you can finally decide to stay.

The United States is rozpojují.
The cultural and political divide between the blue and red states deepens.
California has declared a ban on the travel of its citizens to the state of Tennessee and other seven states.
The Tennessee state paided it and declared a retaliatory ban on the travel of its citizens to California.
Of course, this is not a full-term ban, US citizens can travel freely in all fifty states.
This is to say that California has banned state money for travel by its citizens to eight other states, such as Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.
Who's gonna stop this madness?
California is strongly for LGBT and any sign of disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle is considered to be discrimination.
However, Tennessee has enacted a law of conscience, according to which a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with the treatment of patients from the LGBT community is not obliged to provide it, but is obliged to provide those patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other countries have enacted laws that allow religious charitable organizations that have received children from mothers after birth for adoption have no obligation to provide stejnopohlavním couples with these children for adoption.
Because of these laws, California's consciences have banned the financing of their citizens ' journeys to eight union states from their means.
In practice, this means that California professors are not allowed to travel to a scientific symposium in Texas, for example, from their universities, because they are co-financed by the State of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions for example to Tennessee with financial support from their schools.
They must get either federal grants, but it is absurd for the federal government to finance the citizens ' journeys from state A to state B, or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee has received patience and its Parliament has adopted a law with a resolution that it also dislikes California's high-tax policy, high state spending, high deficits, and the tolerance of illegal immigrants, but still on California because of it's travel Embargo Neuvaluje.
Imposes is in retaliation for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
(a) The same shall occur in respect of any other state of the Union which would have ordered a similar prohibition of travel for any reason whatsoever.
He also called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That's the facts, now a comment.
The situation is toxic.
First, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to adopt laws on a reservation of conscience, as well as to decide what their money will go on and what they are not allowed to do.

California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas, and seven other states were California, too!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community once rightfully sought to tolerate their lifestyles.
Today, many members of this community are governed by the rule of live and let live, which should be managed by all sensible people, but some activists aspire not to tolerance towards themselves and others, but to extreme intolerance towards others.
According to them, no one should ever show moral, religious, or philosophical disagreements about LGBT lifestyles, and if they do, they should be Kriminalizován.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are the modern enemies of liberty.
Fifth, I do not know the situation in American history, when States made such naschválys because of political issues, except in the case of one.

The only case was 50. Years 19. In the 20th century, the political mortified was slavery and time coming to the war of the North against the south.
Of course, there is no such thing now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political gap between the states of the blue Democratic and Republican red states is deepening, and the US is mentally rozpojujíed internally.

Trumpův new chief of staff plans to limit president's media diet
Many of them tried before him, and they always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, it will be the first.
The portal has said that the new chief of staff at the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including reports on television news, hoping to keep Trump on the surface.
Here is part of the report of the reporter Josh Dawseye:
"When the new chief of the White House staff of John F. Kelly met the first day in a new job with the staff, he outlined the key problem of the Trumpova White House, which he intends to remedy: incorrect information that is being given to the president in his hands.
Kelly announced that he must personally approve all the information-whether on paper or the word of speech-because the president can make a better decision on the basis of the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors have vylámala teeth on Trump's control and his presentation in the media.
The Trumpův relationship with the media dates back several decades — and now, when sitting in the White House, his habit of watching the television news is even more powerful.
"If the Trump was a candidate with an honorary coverage, it was convenient to show him that a lot of other media was talking about him in a positive light that was easier to persuade," said in February for the politician Sam Nunberg, a former campaign consultant.
Tara Palmeriová of the portal, politically, said that "the key to keeping Trump tweets at bay--at least in the words of the six former organizers of his campaign--is to ensure that Trump regularly observes the media that are raving about it."
Good.
However, the idea that the Trumpova tendency to publish their views on Twitter has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign organizers know something about what others have no idea-that Trumpovy tweets would be more outrageous if someone hadn't checked them out.
The tweets that Trump never sent are very likely to be never known.
If his employees managed to keep him at least a few times at bay, their efforts did not wasted.
But no one has ever been able to stop Trumpovy on a regular basis to stimulate controversial issues.
Part of this problem is that, in the White House, which consists of competing factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by Trumpovying Podsunují Materials--which may or may not be reliable--that support their view of the world.
The policy portal, which covered the issue on all sides, published in May a report on the inclination of advisers to submit dubious information to the head of state.
This is an example of such information from pen reporter Shane Goldmacherové:
"The current and former Trump officials claim that the president often responds very angrilyly to the negative news from the media, especially the information disclosure reports, and seeks to find their origin.
This situation occurred at the end of February when someone gave the president a copy of the article from GotNews.com-the website of provocateur Charles C. Johnson-who accused the representative chief of staff Katie Walsh of being the ' source of many information leaks ' from the white House.
Regardless, Johnson was forever banned from Twitter for harassment; Or that his claim nepodložil no evidence; Or that he had already published false accusations in the past and later appealed.
Trump read the article and started asking Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that the then chief of staff Reiner Priebus and White House secretary Rob Porter "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the information that President Trump receives."
Would it work?
Kelly is now trying to enforce the same strategy three months later.
Perhaps it turns out to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trumpova impulsiveness is just not lost, and his helpers are still competing for power.
These unchanging factors of Kelly's mission certainly feel worse.

The Italians are in the fight against the rescue ships of NGOs with immigrants aboard
Italy has announced that it prevents NGO rescue ships arriveing to the coast of Italy with Mediterranean immigrants unless the NGO signs new rules regulating their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to think that they could continue their operations," said the Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitiho warning came the day after the Italian authorities seized the ship of the German rescue organization Jugend Rettet because of suspicion of trafficking in human beings, which greatly facilitates illegal immigration.
The rescue organization, which works the first year, refused to comment on the matter because of allegations by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogia Cartosiose.
"For us is and always will be the number one priority of saving human lives. So we are very sorry that we cannot operate in rescue zones at this time, "the organization said in a social media statement.
"All the momentary accusations can only be commented after gathering all the information and evaluating the whole situation."

Her crew is suspected of carrying yearlying immigrants on the ship, which were handed over by traffickers to people, repeatedly.
At least one of the meetings was allegedly only 1.3 miles from the coast of Libya, according to the applicant's file. The meeting progress has been published by Italian media.
The crew of the ship is suspected of breaking the law and skirting the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in this area-from humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct establishes the presence of an Italian police officer aboard ships such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in rescue operations have yet agreed to adhere to the code: Save The Children, Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
On Thursday, the latter said that the new rules are not necessary, but acceptable, since they do not represent any "material change or obstacle" as far as rescue operations are concerned.
The adoption of a new code of conduct, for example, has rejected a Nobel laureate (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti has been told that the sharp decline of immigrants in recent weeks, go ashore in Italy as part of rescue operations, suggests that the effort to strengthen the patrols off the coast of Libya and the cooperation with local mayors bears fruit.

Michelle Carter condemned for sending text messages pobízejících to Conrad Roy's suicide
The woman of Massachusetts was sentenced to a two-year imprisonment for inciting her friend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Twenty years Michelle Carter will sit for 15 months from the two-year penalty behind bars and then spend five years in a Podmínečném release.
Carter was sentenced in June for the unintentional killing of Conrad Roy, who married his own life 13. July 2014.
Roy's father testified in court on Thursday: "The whole family is overwhelmed.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was left to freedom until the decision.
She was threatened by up to 20 years of imprisonment, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and cream blouses, Carter stood in the announcement of the judgment on the spot with tears in his eyes, folded hands and eyes directed towarded to the ground.
"It killed Conrad Roy," the plaintiff said to the judge.
"She ended his life to Ulevila herself.
She failed to accept her own responsibility, "she said.
"No remorse."
But Carter's attorney said they were "unfortunate circumstances that he deeply regrets."
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that "her age or level of maturity or even mental disorder do not have a significant impact on her actions".
The applicant read the statement of Royovy mother Lynn Royové: "Neuběhne one day to netruchlila the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me-I care about his sisters and together we will endure the immense pain we will carry with us forever, "said the statement.
Roy's sister Camdyn Royová testified that she was "haunted" by the knowledge that she would never attend a brother wedding and never be an aunt of his children.
"The loss of a man I she from my birth is the pain he carry for life," she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a valid law to penalise a person helping to kill another person. That is why the case is based on legal precedent.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in 2014 on a car seat poisoned with carbon dioxide.
The case drew the attention of the entire nation after they were published text messages to Carter, which encourage suicide.
"Maybe hang, jump out of the building or strike, I don't care," she wrote in a text message that Carter sent only two weeks before his death when Roy was on a family vacation.
A few minutes before his suicide, he wrote, "You have to do Conrad" and "You just need to make a generator and you're free and happy".
Judge Moniz said that Carter yearned for attention through Royovy death and ordered to refrain from any comments in the press.
The case raised many questions.

Lavender from Provence threatens climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of Provence in the southeastern region of France, but now they are threatened by climate change.
Lavender is shrinking as a result of dry climates and harmful insects, causing dismay on the faces of researchers and farmers seeking solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: "The cultivation of lavender in Provence is at risk, because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings with it less rainfall in spring and autumn.
This affects the life of lavender.
Cicadas and locusts carrying micro-bacteria, which thrive in dry climates, also have their guilt. "
There are many at stake.
Lavender attracts tourists and the oil produced by them is an important ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of long and beautiful flowers grow smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants.
The amount of oil obtained from these lavenders is, of course, less. "
A possible solution can be more efficient distribution of water and a deceleration of the evaporation of water from the soil, as well as spraying lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding of several types resistant to dry weather.

The murder of a journalist emphasizes the growing threats in Mexico
Staff at Riodoce Weekly meet every Wednesday to discuss the news about the riots that take place in the Sinaloa area with the participation of organised criminals, corrupt officials, and persistent drug wars.
Today, however, the onslaught of recent events is largely missing because of its own safety.
Learn that it is important that they change their habits.
Two deserving journalists talk about what would be safer: taking their children with them to an office that someone attacked a grenade in 2009, or left them at home.
Safety experts wrote three simple words on the black Board: adversaries, neutrals and allies.
They ask journalists to put names on each word-no evidence is needed, just use imagination and foreboding.
Choosing them from – drug dealers, politicians, marketers and journalists are suspects of taking money from government or drug cartels – a catalog of criminals whose job is to cover up criminal acts.
The violence of the Neustává and the body pile up to a pile across the entire country; Journalists among them are continually increasing: according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists, there are at least 25 since the advent of President Enrique Pena Nieta to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; And in all seven countries, seven were killed this year.
Among them also co-founder of periodical Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence, which is linked to drug trafficking.
His loss is palpable, although his presence is pervasive-a great photograph of Valdeze with the inscription "Justice", on which he shows middle finger, hangs in the front of the building; Two journalists – Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez – age over 30, have a T-shirt with a photo of Valdeze with a smile on his face, goggles on his nose and cap Panama.
The meeting is held less than two months after his death; Journalists talk about reciprocal traumas, nocturnal nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Yet, in the year 2010, a special federal prosecutor's office was set up to address cases of journalists, so far, according to the Committee's opinion on the protection of journalists, the two suspects sued.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur every year are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime. Murder journalists are so very exceptionally getting to court.
Journalists from Riodoce insist that they will inform about the violence that is happening in Sinaloe; Even though the destruction of the grief and the given territory is currently very treacherous.
Without information about murderers and without the vision of justice, the security meeting is irrelevant, says Ibarra.
"It's foolish to waste time on such meetings," he adds.
"If we don't get more information, you can't trust anyone."
Morning of 15. May left Valdez headquarters Riodoce in Culiacánu, the capital of Sinaloy.
He managed to ride a few blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and usmrtili him 12 shots, presumably because of the title of the article-which can be translated as the Twelfth River.
The Gunners then stepped into his car and hacked him near the scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50 years.
He left behind a woman and two adult children.
The rumors seem to be spreading quickly in the Culiacanu.
In Valdezově case, however, there is a suspicious silence.
Since last year's arrest of Guzmána and his January release to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields countries, as the competing faction tries to fill the empty space.
Several people are killed every day in the streets of Sinaloi, and the cemetery is full of vyšperkovaných two-storey mausoleums for drug kings, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word "truce" means that one drug cartel controls a coastal State with valuable ports and important routes to travel to the United States of drugs.
At the same time, as the fact that Valdez was intimately acquainted with the risks of his job, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoce, still obniňuje that he did not protect his friend.
He believes that two misconduct has contributed to his death.
The first was the February issue of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the competing drug cartels that led the war with the sons of Joaquín Guzmána.
The reconciliation could upset the sons; The suspect gang members Skoupili all copies of the newspaper at the moment they landed on the shelves.
The second mistake was to Nepřinutit Valdeze to leave the country for its own safety after the seizure of other newspapers in which the same story was published.
Valdez became a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is viewed as an important milestone in the battle of Mexican criminals against journalists.
He had been able to survive for so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that it would never change.
In periodical Noroeste was practically a veteran, when in 2003 decided to sell his shares worth $50 and found together with five colleagues Riodoce.
In Sinaloe "It was impossible to run journalism and not mention the drug trade," said Bojorquez.
Riodoce gained a good reputation for brave and truthful news; The newspapers have begun to flourish.
Journalists like to going in search of problematic topics and publish texts without Censorship-the reader was fascinated to read stories that no one else dared to issue.
Eight years after the foundation, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for a report on Latin America.
The same year won the Valdez award of the International Freedom Press Committee for the protection of journalists for their brave reports on the Mexican drug trade.
Valdez, openly, admitted he was afraid.
"I was worried about my life," he said when accepting the price.
Drug trafficking in SINALOAE is a "way of life", said Valdez in October last year in an interview for Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take on the role of journalist-or to play silly.
I don't want someone to ask me, ' What were you doing face death... why didn't you say what was going on? '. "
Riodoce employees Miss Valdezovi. The man was known for his vtipkováním and indiscriminate language. He was a good friend who enjoyed giving advice and hugs – a teacher who knew how to survive.
They all relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to El Guayabo bar opposite the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: caused this routine his death?
His death also raised questions about his own assumptions-how to do his job best and stay alive?
"They don't like to zaplétáte with their wives, children, clean shops, secret landing areas."
"These things were forbidden," said Bojorquez.
As a result, there is a high level of Sebecenzury and instinct.
You must trust your instincts.
If you feel something's not playing here, hands off.
The trouble is, said the editor Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "the sense of smell is the meaning that can be fool... and then there was the thing with Javier."
The old rules according to him, as in others, Sinaloae no longer apply-as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states that are home to the toxic mix of lucrative smuggling trails, weak governments, and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No mobile phones are allowed in the room where the RIODOCE staff meet; A few days ago, a spyware was discovered that bought governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building two policemen found relief from the forty-degree heat in the shade of a nearby tree.
They were selected by the state to protect the offices of Riodoce, which are located in a čtyřpatrové building in the Měšťácké district of Culiacanu.
Journalists are teasing about the fact that these cops don't belong to the those 50 percent of the defenders of the law, who, according to the government, are corrupt.
It has been several months since journalists last went to the mountainous areas, which essentially control drug cartels.
There are three main stories on the agenda of this week.
The first is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio César Chávez in Sinaloe.
The candlestick also have a suspicious government expense that took place in the state governor's hometown.
Recently, there were several kidnappings in one of the most luxurious Culiacánu restaurants, just a block from the Public Prosecutor's office.
Officially, no one has announced the identity of kidnapped people or the circumstances of kidnapping, so journalists were wary of writing about what everyone in the city knew: that the restaurant is a popular destination for drug traffickers and politicians.
One of the journalists read from public records that the restaurant was registered under a name that is associated with a politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), controlling all levels of the political scene of almost the last century.
Several of the PRI's governors have recently been accused of corruption in high positions.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about past incidents that occurred in the restaurant, including an incident where one of the sons of Joaquín "El chap" Guzmána escaped the Army intervention Unit.
A month ago, readers would read about the subject in the Valdezově column, the best source of information on kidnappings.
"Valdez would definitely deciphered the case," said Villarreal (46), dubbed "El flac" for his slender figure.
"Now all the informers have turned their backs on us."
Valdezova office has turned into storage of signs and stamps to protest against the killing of journalists. The staff certainly did not expect them to become activists in the press representation.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed several signs and released the next morning to demonstrate in front of the Public Prosecutor's Office for another journalist.
Salvador Adam disappeared only three days after Valdezově murder in the west of the state of Michoacán.
Only charred body was discovered. The authorities claim that, based on DNA analysis, this is Adama.
The activity of journalists is intensifying throughout the country. Many of them organize protests and čmárají on sidewalks and buildings "SOS printing".
Bojorquez newspaper director is a day visiting Washington where he tries to get international support and achieve justice for Valdezově death.
At the meeting with Governor Sinaloy, who was held the day after the murder of Valdeze, Ramirez accused the authorities of watching journalists and their murders for preaching the truth.
Meanwhile, she asked for a transfer to another department from fears that her anger might endanger her impartiality.
Valdez repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are "obehnáni" organized crime, corrupt officials, and indifferent public.
In his last book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that journalists are dying not only by the hands of drug cartels, but also by the order of politicians and security forces working together with organised crime.
The media supervisory group Articulo 19 accused of more than half of all attacks on journalists by police officers and public officials.
"You're going to die in Mexico because they want to silence you," Ramirez added.
The murders obviously work.
No one will forget the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Macíasové, which occurred six years ago at the northern borders of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found together with the message, which allegedly signed a cartel of Zetas: "This is how I ended up because of my reports."
Beside chopped off head lay a keyboard and headphones.
Some affiliates have decided to terminate their activity, such as The newspaper El Norte, based at the northern border of the state of Chihuahua in response to the March murder of rapporteur Miroslav Breachové.
The others still continue, just as they did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after killing his director in 2004.
In 2010 Diario de Ciudad Juarez approached publicly drug cartels by article on the introductory page titled "What do You want from us"?
Some journalists have fled their homes or even across borders.
It's a difficult decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult as well as getting rid of the feeling that someone is chasing you constantly.
And journalists are persecuted and killeded, such as. In the case of Rubena Espinosa, who was assassinated in the year 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who choose to stay and nevzdat their work, each day presents a great risk.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs frightens him.
"Mexico is heading to hell, so I became a journalist," he said.
It's Friday midnight and the staff Riodoce sits on the sidewalk in front of the office-the latest release sent to the printer-popíjejíc beer when it suddenly starts to ring the phone.
Learn that 19 people died in a shootout between gang members and policemen near the beach resort in the town of Mazatlán.
The war was intensifying, just as many messages left in this area by syndicate members.
Journalists publish this news from their mobile phone on the website Riodoce.
Neuběhne not one day and the opening title changes again.
The sounds of police sirens point to another shootout.
Bojorquez plunges a glance at the police patrol to see if they're watching.
If they're afraid, they don't make it clear.
Under a huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their periodical-whose middle finger is the an eloquent slogan for the whole Sinaloe-all employees Riodoce follow his footsteps.
"How could we just think of leaving," Bojorquez said, "When Javier was killed on the same day, one an intern asked me to send her to the streets?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however scary.
The researchers have now unveiled the conclusions of the first findings of an amazing creature of the size of a rhino, whose perfectly preserved remains-which the experts called ' Mona Lisa the Dinosaurs '-was found by the Canadian miner.
The relics were preserved so high that the experts could determine the reddish brown color of his flaky skin and said that dinosaur had a ' troubled past '.
An article in the journal Current biologists stated that it is a ' nejzachovalejšího yet found armored dinosaur and one of the best species of dinosaur in the world '.
The fossil is a new species of the family Nodosauridae. Dinosaur lived in the Cretaceous Period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved state was literally shocked by the researchers who described it as ' truly remarkable '.
The armoured Bíložravec is, according to National Geographic, the best preserved fossil of its kind.
Behind the award is Shawn Funk, who revealed the fossil 21. March 2011 when drilling in the mine Suncor Millenium near Canadian Albert.
He came across something that looked like a foreign object and decided to explore it closer.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of paleontologists.
Researchers spent the next six years working on uncovering an animal from a huge piece of land weighing 1100 kg.
After completion of the work the dinosaur is ready for detection.
' Just a little blind eyes and believe that sleeps, ' said Caleb Brown and naturalist of the museum Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is exposed.
' It certainly will be written into history history as one of the most beautiful and nejdochovanějších species of dinosaur-Mona Lisa dinosaurs. '
By studying his skin the researchers found that this herbivor — despite being covered with armor and resembling a walking tank — was very likely to face a serious threat from the carnivorous dinosaurs.
Heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a camouflage system that uses many of today's animals.
The experts say that this has allowed him to blend in better with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The camouflage system indicates that it was a favorite food of the larger dinosaurs.
Reports of 110 million years old dinosaur family Nodosauridae first appeared in newspapers in May. It is currently available for viewing at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers gave him the name Borealopelta Markmitchelli after the engineer of the museum, Mark Mitchell, who, together with the team, spent more than 7000 hours with careful disclosure fossils.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved state of fossils, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists could document the patterns and shape of scales and armor throughout the body.
They unveiled the cloaking method commonly used by today's animals in defense – the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this camouflage effect is common in nature, the findings of researchers are surprising, because the Borealopeltaova size extends far beyond today's animals using the same technique.
It is therefore possible that dinosaur was such a multitude of predators that evolution gave priority to camouflage in the survival before confrontation.
Many contemporary animals with camouflage--for example, deer, zebra, and armadillo--are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that Nosodaurus had to fight its outdated literally.
' The predation of a huge and heavily armoured dinosaur illustrate the dangers posed by predators in the Cretaceous period, ' said Brown.
Chemical analysis of the organic constituents contained in the scales also revealed that dinosaur skins had probably reddish-brown coloring.
Researchers continue to study the animal and searching after further knowledge of his life, including the preserved contents of the stomach to vypátrali his last meal.
He believes that dinosaur fell into the river after death and was taken to the sea, where it sank to the bottom.
In the Alberta region, the climate was the same as in today's Florida, and rivers and oceans stretched much farther inland than it is today.
' This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved flaky skin while it is preserved in three dimensions and we can see its original size, ' said Brown.
' For these reasons the beast looks practically the same as in the time of chalk.
You don't have to use your imagination to renovate it; Just a little blind eyes, and it seems like he's just asleep. '
In the period of chalk, giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, who moved on two legs walked down the ground.
Although the king of all dinosaurs-Tyrannosaurus Rex-lived several million years after Borealopeltaovi, this armored dinosaur could have been a favorite prey of his equally fearsome ancestors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, a 11.5 meter long monster with a weight of over 6 tons.
The researchers, whose latest findings were published in the journal Current biologists, believe that the body of Borealopelta was vyplavenoed into the sea after it was mumifikováned in the mud.
Behind the award is Shawn Funk, who revealed the fossil 21. March 2011 when drilling in the mine company Suncor Millenium near Canadian Albert.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including leather and armour, which is also complete from the muzzle to the hip.
The animal reached an average of 5 metres in length and weighed up to 1300 kg.
protruded two 50 cm spines from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that this herbivore brázdiled the territory of today's Canada until it ended up in a river that sailed him into the sea.
His underwater tomb preserved the body in perfect condition.
The fossil remains of this species are preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remnants of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote wrote for National Geographic, ' Finding this surviving individual can be compared to winning a lottery.
The longer I follow him, the shocking discovery strikes me.
The fossil remains of this species are preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remnants of the skin.
At his side lies his right front leg with his fingers facing up.
I can easily count the scales on his feet. '

How one activist learned the answer to the question: ' Whose Streets? '
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrellová shook all over her body.
The day after she arrived in New York, native from St. Louis sat on the bed in the Airbnb room and went through the Facebook posts on her phone.
She came across the post of a high school pupil.
"The police just shot a 18letého young man whose body still lies on the street," it said.
She wondered if anyone else had written this post, so she closed Facebook and opened up Twitter.
The user @TheePharoah continually retweeted her posts to the wall.
Rapper from St. Louis released on Twitter his posts about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18letého young man who shot a white-skinned cop in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photograph of the Brown's body, how lying limply on the street, where no one had taken it after four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrellová thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put down the phone to return to the evening, when she watched tweets about people who had gathered on Canfield Drive.
She watched the pictures of police tapes and roaring people. One of the men claimed to be the victim's father and held a sign with the inscription "Ferguson police killed my unarmed son"!
She watched the live news--one of the policemen faced a group of protesters, holding in his hand, and at the other end of the barking dog.
In another video he held another policeman, as she said, in the hand of the gun with which he was aiming at the crowd and yelling, "I'll kill you all... animals."
"That's not normal," Ferrellová said to himself.
"This is not the kind of murder we've gotten used to, and which we can call normal.
I felt goose bumps all over my body.
"I was angry and I cried."
She immediately booked the return flight and traveled home the next day.
After landing at 23:00, she picked up her liberty daughter from her father and decided to make it to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrellové and Ferguson over the next three years describes the new "Whose Streets?" document, which will be shown in cinemas on September 11, 2001. August.
It is a story of survival and protests, love and resistance, strength, and resilience narrated from the perspective of people living in the community who go to the streets and clamoring the answers.
On the way to Ferguson, Ferrellová introduced a dialogue with his daughter-dressed in floral jerseys and the same floral headband-on the subject that had been sifting through many times-"the experience of blacks."
"Remember how I taught you how Negroes had to fight for what they believed in?" he recalls.
"We're going to Ferguson right now, because the police killed 18letého young man and that's not right."
"It didn't seem that I wouldn't take it with me," Ferrellová said later.
"Today's events are the culmination... that has occurred in the past.
She had to know and see with her own eyes and grow up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but also to know the difference between different layers of experience with blacks and what we need to do to liberate ourselves.
Yet, I am able to assure her of the conditions in which she does not experience racism on her own, no different in any way from another black-child woman.
I feel that if I were to protect her from this experience, I would just uškodila her. "
Upon arriving at Ferguson, it was the first stop on the South Florissant Road Road, opposite the police department, which became a base of activists who had expected the words of Darren Wilson's officer about his eventual involvement in the incident.
Here, Ferrellová and his daughter met with a local entrepreneur who was preparing for the other food.
Together they prepared the food in sachets and helped it to be carried out by the Protestants.
In the eyes of Ferrellové, a new type of activism slowly began to give birth.
"My activism is after 9. August turned upside down, "said Ferrellová, adding that while studying at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was the president of the minority Student Nurses Assn. and sought to introduce health care and food in black communities.
"I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural. "
A few weeks later, Ferrellová became acquainted with the later codirector of the documentary, Sabaah Folayanovou, during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "only document" the ongoing events.
Ferrellovou, however, thought: "Are you working on a document or are you trying to find a story to use?"
Such a type of skepticism Saintes into the community through many people, often Caucasians, who wanted to capitalize on pain and decisiveness.
As Folayanová explained in Nedáném interview: "We have heard that the voices of people born and growing up in Ferguson are very often neglected, and we wanted to change that."
Folayanová has already established cooperation with co-director Damon Davis, who is a renowned local artist who deals with the topic of prisoners on death row.
His participation in the Zainteserovala project also Ferrellovoued and together with the other six locals who watched the "Whose Streets?" Team in the years following Brown's assassination.
"No one speaks for us in this document, but it's our testimony," Davis said.
"It was important to me-how will these people be represented-because I will be represented in the same way."
While the aim of the document was not to focus on the experiences of Ferrellové-in an attempt to show that the movement "is not about spasitelském leaders, but about the rapprochement of the community," said Folayanová-it turned out that she is the most open to participation in filming.
The document "Whose Streets?" thus describes the very personal aspect of the life of Ferrellové, for example, how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrellová, smiling on his face at the thought of the first moment Zhlédla the final version of the document.
"I understand, however, that in order to do this job and polidštit blacks, I have to open up."
The Ferrellové story also highlights the role of the eccentric black women in the broader aspect of the Black lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement – who created in response to the killing of a teenager Trayvona Martina in 2012 on the social media campaign under #BlackLivesMatter – call themselves weirdos.
"Black eccentric women in leadership positions ultimately stand behind the movement," said Ferrellová, "because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women must tolerate the weight of these events. "
Folayanová agrees with this expression and adds that "the movement is in fact supported by black women and a large number of eccentric black women."
However, it insists that "this is not a mere affirmative affair" and Ferrellová is not the main heroine of the document because of its views.
"She was the driving force and power source," she said.
"That she was just found in the front lines is no coincidence, because life at these intersections in the skin of a black freaky woman is dangerous.
You feel the burst of energy in front of the screen. "
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the vyklidily cameras of the TV stations have their positions, but the heavy racial ties between the community and the police persist.
Ferrellová serving a two-and-a-half-year condition for blocking the highway in demonstrations.
The socially political atmosphere in the area called home described as "disorder."
Still, Neustává in her pursuit, which she undertook from the moment she went to Ferguson's streets three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
All we can lose is our chains. "

and Becoming Resemblance: Artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
There are several faces of different skin shades-white, black and swarthy-suspended from the ceiling on the wires in the centre of one of the New York Fridman Gallery. Each of them seemed to fall off the previous one.
All 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborgová from the oral swabs and hair that was sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth, where the former analyst serving 35letý punishment for unauthorized disclosure of the secret kabelogramů to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, launched on 2. August, bears the name and Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborgovou, which combines his experience of technology, informatics and art, and Manning-transgender and pioneering dissident, whose punishment has fallen Obama three days before his departure from the post President of the United States.
By algorithmic analysis of DNA Manning and using 30 portraits to illustrate how a person would look with this genotype, he created Dewey-Hagborgová trenchant, if not an intellectual commentary on the meekness of DNA-as well as many ways in which DNA can be Interpret-and Neodmyslitelném determinizmu these interpretations as well as identities.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward Manning, has been talking since his youth about being considered a woman. She was convicted in 2013 on the basis of twenty indictments, including violations of six spy laws, computer fraud and theft.
All her photographs Zadržovali the staff of the prison. Only one black-and-white photograph of the lower quality was leaked to the public, and the Manning, visibly concerned, sits on the driver's seat in a platinum blond wig, which is now associated.
In 2015, he still doznívaly a positive reaction to the 2012 Dewey-Hagborgové project by Stranger Visions.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborgová used various forensic objects-such as. Cigarette butts cigarettes and chewing gum-to create an image of possible forms of these people.
And it was at this time that she received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They were about to interview Chelsea Manning in jail and wanted to make an article with a portrait," said Dewey-Hagborgová on the occasion of opening a new exhibition.
However, visits and photos were not allowed, so they turned to Chelsea asking if they would be interested in the DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse hit it off in two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic book called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungovou, who introduced a vision of what would happen if Chelsea was Omilostněna and could attend the exhibition in person.
Indeed, President Obama has asked for Manning for a few days after the comic's release, which was a welcome change after a few intolerable years spent in a Kansas military prison.
Indeed, it is interesting that the exhibition is underway at a time when Donald Trump is leading a war with people who seek to publish government information and TRANSGENDEROVÝMI soldiers while trying to find new ways to stimulate resentment in the areas that should Support.
In response to a question about this special timing, Dewey-Hagborgová said that "everything is going on for some reason".
Under the declaration of an artist on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls his huge signature (the letter "I" in the surname is dotted with the heart) after the end of the "automatic factionalism based on gender, race, sexuality and culture".
On the opposite side are the sequences of its mitochondrial DNA-centipede letters C, G and a recorded with a pencil.
By classifying 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the sophisticated scientific vocabulary of an artist), Dewey-Hagborgová wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least after the biological page, we are all.
"I hope that people will take away that our genome doesn't matter who we are, and that the genetic data is subjective, and everyone can interpret them in their own way," said Dewey-Hagborgová. There is also her work Spurious Memories from the year 2007 on the theme of video.
"DNA tells many different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last specimen of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page from the graphic amendment mentioned above.
Depicting Manning, how is emerging in the way of King Kong from United States Disiplinary Barracks, with a megaphone in his hand.
"They'll win," he says, as soon as they're prevented from speaking.
"Never let yourself be silenced."
"It's a direct transcript from one of the letters," said the Philadelphia artist.
"If I think of it, it's creepy."
So far, Manning has not personally visited the exhibition-which was foretold in the comic book-but when this happens, he will be welcomed in the center of the room with his masks, his own genomovými portraits, ordered as a mob of Protestants.
Which was also the purpose of the exhibition, including almost 160 cm high statue of Maningové, to which the pencil is recorded its genetic haplogroup.
"In the past, they were placed on the walls, but this time I wanted to make them sálal feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborgová about portraits.
"I wanted to bring the impression of mass motion, which takes the form of Chelsea and liberates it."

"In the near future we will complete the WADA plan"-Vice-Chairman of the Russian government Mutko
The Vice-Chairman of the Russian government, Vitaly Mutko, said it would not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the znovuustanovení of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"Part of the criteria of the new plan has already been completed and RUSADA has already acquired the right to planning and testing in cooperation with the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this fact, the WADA plan was updated, "said Mutko on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA plan to comply with the code-which describes the criteria for the renewal of RUSADA-which was recently published on the organization's website.
According to the Mutka code, there is nothing that Russia should worry about.
"Everything has been announced and everything will also be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.
One of the above criteria nonetheless calls for a public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation, by Prošetřoval Richard McLaren, about the alleged sponsorship of the doping of Russian athletes by the government.

But there were no state programs in our country, and we cannot confess to something that never existed. "
The Mutkova words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian independent public anti-Doping Commission.

The state counts with citizens in defending the state.
They will support their training.
With financial support for state defense societies, with voluntary firing training or with a team of training trainers, it calculates the substantive intention of the Law on the readiness of citizens to defend the state.
The defence ministry, which was given the task of the Government, promises to increase the physical prowess of Czechs and their abilities, which could then be used in crisis situations.
This results from a proposal prepared by the Ministry.
If the law were adopted in the future, the state would incur hundreds of millions of crowns to support the Brannosti.
The basic objective of the proposal is, according to its authors, to create an effective system to help increase the readiness of the Czech population to defend the state, outside the performance of the conscription and on a voluntary basis.
The state would, for example, support the societies of radioamateurs, shooters or kynologů, financially or materially, and would allow their members to increase their capacities.
In return, it would obtain data on people who are willing, if necessary, to come to Earth in a time of crisis to help, and about their capabilities or material equipment.

"The whole concept must respect the gradual wiping of the previously obvious boundaries between the different types of threats," it is stated in the intention of referring to the dangers of the so-called hybrid threats.
Ministry officials noted that the focus must therefore be on supporting the widest set of capabilities, not just military ones.
"The basic aim of the project is to create a very broad basis to enable each citizen to respond appropriately to situations threatening the sovereignty of the State or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect themselves, or to contribute to the protection of others, and to the incorrect Conduct does not bother to carry out tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, "states the intention.
The adoption of the law would yield considerable financial demands.
Their amount will depend on the chosen variant according to the ministry.
For example, the Office foresees financial support for projects to prepare citizens for the defence of the state up to 100 million crowns.
If an administrative and coordination Centre were established, its operation could cost around 60 million crowns a year.
More money would go to salaries or to build an information system.
The proposal also foresees that it would have to expand the scope of regional military headquarters, which would hired the other 42 soldiers together.

Companies are beginning to realize that it is necessary to take care of the culture of the working environment-in case they would become another Uber-which is in the scandals after a former employee posted on his blog post describing the corporate environment and harassment Employees who dare to speak openly.
For startups like Glint, demand for corporate culture surveys is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let's Talk payments website, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and subject compliance sector can exceed 118.8 billion by the year 2020.
The Startup Convercent of Denver, Colorado, which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity early in the year, just before Uber scandals.
Nearly 600 clients Convercentu include Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Recently, he also accepted Uber under his wings.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable "lightning" surveys, collect real-time confidential information, and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
If the general Director is involved, complaints are sent directly to the board of directors.
"The Court of Justice has been empowered by regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of startup Convercent.
If the company is convicted of improper treatment of its employees or unethical behaviour-and if the regulators do not intervene-may face costly consequences due to a boycott of customers, exhaustion of employees or legal proceedings, added Quinlan.
The network of Ruby Tuesday restaurants, which employs over 25 000 people across 500 locations, uses Convercent more than a year to increase employee awareness about corporate policies and procedures and to provide an easy way to contact corporate leadership.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report any problem, he had to trace the phone number or email to the company's management to form a complaint and hope for successful resolution.
It was often a deterrent and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, General representative of Ruby Tuesday, according to which there was no reliable way to monitor employee complaints.
Now that the company uses Convercent, rapid detection and resolution of problems that have never been made to managers sitting in offices, miles away from the actual resolution of complaints-for example, discrimination, harassment or Unfair treatment.
"It is approaching a holistic, overall view of the experience of the employees," said Vitrano, who controls a group of Ruby Tuesdays who supervise risk management.
"At the same time, we protect shareholders from litigation by employees."
Companies have stopped taking ethics, value, and employee participation lightly in 2002, after Arthur Andersen collapsed after Enron's fall in abuse of ethical rights of employees, Quinlan said.
But when "the whole thing shone on social media", companies began to realize that they could not simply hide their skeletons in the closet in the online world.
"Before people started using the technology to track their ethics, they relied on faith," added Quinlan.
Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of a service for which companies pay regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity approved by brave Kapitáloví investors, who supported both startups.
Convercent chose $10 million in the February campaign from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and eventually took the capital of 47 million.
Glint received $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and won 60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of societies, cultures and venture capital.
The growing number of researches clearly confirms that today's employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as the Silicon Valley are not the main advantage of high salaries and interesting projects.
Employees want to perceive that they are accepted and appreciated, and that they devote their time to a company that strives for a positive mission.
"If people are happy in their work, they perceive that their voice is heard, and that their work is rewarding, striving for the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and LinkedIn's employee benefits, which uses Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn if companies and companies thrive if they are satisfied by its employees.
And when an analytical tool appears on the market to ensure employee engagement and commitment to society, it is no surprise that a lot of investors will be found to support this effort.
According to experts in working culture it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is useless if the company fails act the necessary steps.
The fact is that once the company has requested feedback from its employees, there can be major changes.
And if the change does not occur quickly-in the worst case at all-can evoke disappointment and disinterest of employees.
"Once you have asked for 4000 views, you must be prepared for 4000 conversations," said Russell Raath, director of consultancy at Kotter International, who has witnessed many companies that rely too much on data itself.
"Because once things nedotáhnete to an end, employees begin to wonder: ' Did they hear me at all?
Interested in me?
And if not, then why should it interest me? ' " "
Madison Reed, now regularly conducting a survey of employees every month, is able to solve the problem within one day by Glintu, said Errettová.
After gathering feedback from employees who were frustrated with slow decision-making and quality of communication, Errettová managed to reorganize several teams within the company and start training communication to successful solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday acquires a very important view of its employees and hopes that, in the long run, it will achieve high employment in a field known as frequent redundancies.
"If you are not striving to create a transparent working environment, employees will not believe you," added Vitrano.
"And as soon as you start losing your employees, you will lose your customers.
And with the outflow of customers goes bankrupt the whole company. "
Thursday was the hottest day.
Thursday is with 38.3 degrees recorded in the military post on Hodonínsko the hottest day of the year in the Czech Republic.
He overcame so Úterek, which was originally the hottest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
They informed the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
Not a lot of temperature records fell from Tuesday on Thursday.
The heat was mainly affected by Moravia, in Bohemia it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, the records were surpassed or settled at 35 from 145 meteorological stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded a record.
For example, the current temperature was the same as the previous record of the year 2013.
In Lednice on the Břeclavsku of today's 37.4 degree surpassed the original maximum by four tenths of a degree and in Pohořelicích on Brněnsku current 37.1 degree exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, like the military post, came from the year 2013.
High temperatures today appeared mainly in the south and East Moravia.
After the watch house was the most hot in Dyjákovicích on Znojmo region and Brod nad Dyjí on Břeclavsku, where Mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but the record did not surpass.
By contrast, for example, in western and northwest Bohemia, the site Chmi today's highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures started growing there later in the afternoon," the Weathermen said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will be gradually odeznívat according to Chmi and more significant rains could come on Sunday.
At most places in Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and southeast Moravia as well as on Saturdays.
We had a nešvar.
It is not enough for billionaires to have the same voice in the election as every single plnoletému man in the country.
They want to make decisions directly, and because not everyone is as insolent as Andrei Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
The owner of Penta Marek Dospiva, together with other colleagues behind the water, Martin Burdou and Antonín Fryčem sponsors Robejškovy realist.
The second life of the Civic Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of the insurance company and the entrepreneur in the realities Pavel got it, who is his party also chairman.
The condemned Korupčník and King of Czech gambling Ivo Valenta took the party of Freeholders.
The political movement of Agrofert, as the project of Andrei Babiše was named by Kroměříž Mayor Jaroslav Němec, is a chapter to itself.
The mayors also recently caught their billionaires.
It is Dalibor the old man, the owner of the company on security equipment Jablotron.
In his own words, he enters politics so that he does good.
But the entree in Starostenském jersey did not Dědkovi much.
"I've never dreamed of small goals," he said at a press conference.
This means that my goal is to make the movement yes, so that the mayor's movement receives twenty percent of the election.
Some smiled.
But Dědkovo tongue is rather symptomatic.
The billionaire Dalibor old is a man of solid opinion.
Although he intends to bid for voters ' voices in the mayor's jersey, he continues to support Andrei Babiše.
The old man Babiše in the past parliamentary elections.
"Babiš is not a seasoned speaker and does not rule líbivou the rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote about him before the election of 2013.
But it certainly does not go into politics because it would like to personally improve.
For me, the Babiš hero will remain.
He is willing to step out of his world, who is under control, and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the mayors introduced him as a new reinforcement, he confessed his admiration for Babišovi again.
And he said that he wanted the mayors to learn the possible cooperation with Babišem to imagine.
Some can appreciate that the old man does not change his views and stands for his own regardless of the jersey he is wearing.
Others can speculate whether Babiš sends to the mayors to build his B someone like this nemotorného.
Others may ask if the Boss Jablotron mission to be with the boss of Agrofertu Nerozešel hard at the store and not looking for another way to defend his business rival.
The first Dědkova public appearance was not just around Babiše.
The old man promised that the mayor would send ten million crowns to the campaign.
And if they say they need more money, they'll send more.
A few years ago, a similar statement would have been hard to pause.
Indeed, the court-recognized Crook Zdeněk Bakala, before the elections in 2010, rozhazoval millions on all sides.
The political division of the Security Agency Vít Bárta, TOP 09 and civilian Democrats have come together to nearly thirty million.
But today is another time.
The law forbids anyone to give more than three million to a political party.
When the old man enters politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Perhaps he would not have to wonder why politics has such a bad reputation with us.
The Old man crowned his first days in politics with a proposal for a tax advantage of families with studovanými children.
People with a university degree will come to about fifty thousand a month.
Those with basic in less than twenty.
A man with fifty thousand is rich in the local situation.
The one with twenty poor.
In a Dědkově vision, the poor are honestly paying taxes, and the rich enjoy the benefits of working in a welfare state that is not much involved.
The rich are simply to help them not to toil misery with urgency.
The mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition and Babiš their hands.
The rest of us, thanks to Dědkovi, can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
There remains the question of whom to vote.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who are members of their parties, or citizens and nationals of the State, do not have their property as their employees and country.
And finally, those who want the rich country to live well to all people, not just some.
No one wanted Trumpův paradise.
The villa complex had to cheaper by 234 million.
Selling a property is sometimes not easy.
And often it doesn't help even 11 bedrooms, a magnificent view of the sea or the fact that the property is sold by US President Donald Trump.
At the sale of the villa complex Le Chateau des Palmiers, the price went down by an incredible 8 million pounds.
Informed about the Web Mirror.co.uk.
In the brochure, the plot reads: "Sincerely, Donald J. Trump."
Escape to a place like no other.
But the merger of a real estate company with the US president Neobhájilo an extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to cut the price of his Caribbean mansion by an incredible 8 million pounds.
The original price of the property was 21.5 million pounds, the final price dropped to 13 million pounds.
Even after discounts, the villa complex stands about as 76 average apartments in the centre of Prague.
And it's not surprising.
The breathtaking 5-acre mansion on the Caribbean island of St. Martin has 12 full-size bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, a gym and other facilities.
It consists of several buildings.
The property includes a swimming pool and a tennis court.
Dozens of palms are planted on the property.
The terrace has a magnificent view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the price showed the fact that the connection with the President is not sufficient to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to the normal prices of real estate on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid around £15 million.
The property was to be purchased for rental purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin.
But the new price ranks second.
The property in the neighborhood was valued at 13.5 million. Pounds.
The NCAA has decided to put an end to two trainings a day. Long days for the Bruins

Players enrolled in the summer semester leave to the rooms after Tříhodinovém training to study at the final exam before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at the meeting, which takes place the coming morning at 6:30.
"These boys will be kwok for the next three days," said the Bruins coach to Jim Mora a moment before the Monday swung on Tuesday.
By decommissioning two workouts in one day, the NCAA wants to lighten the players – paradoxically, the training days are even longer – at least until Friday when the final exam ends.
That's why the first three UCLA trainings are scheduled for 19:15 – to vtěsnaly into the already crowded diary of many students.
For the first time in six seasons, which spent Mora on the position of a trainer in Westwood, the Bruins training camp starts a week earlier than last year and trainings are limited during the summer semester. It also has a decision to limit the number of workouts from two to one daily.
In total, eighteen trainings are scheduled until the 20th August, whereupon they begin the formal preparations for the first game against the Texas A&M team, which takes place in September.
Mora had been told that he supported the NCAA decision, despite having added another item to the already busy player diaries.
"Three or four days players are under great stress and it is very exhausting for them," said Mora.
"But nobody gave up, they all try. They're great.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down. "
UCLA will be closed after the end of the training camp, which will not be easy looking at the clear lines of surrounding land from the adjacent parking lot and the luxury hotel Luskin Center, which was occupied by the players after harvesting the protective net behind the goal bar.
The Bruins should occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora recognizes that when rooms are emptied during the season, there could be a problem.
"The land will guard the security service," added Mora.
"The safety is taken care of, but it is not excluded that someone can rent a room and record our trainings.
It is well traded with such material.
Fortunately, the Hotel will be guarded by security, as well as car park No. 8.
We will use our resources to the maximum.
I believe everything will be fine.
Everything is scheduled. "

Making a graphic novel: A story about a Castle in England
The small castle of Scotney Castle recently played a major role in the Squeeze music video clip, and Margaret Thatcher also found its refuge during the 70. and 80. Years of the last century.
Scotney, however, had witnessed a 700 years of tumultuous history from his cosy spots by the Bewl River in British Kent, which inspired the curly Jamie Rhodes from York County-a famous hobby in historical documents-to create a graphic novel.
"Looking at the scriptures of a man who is 300 years after death fascinates me," Rhodes says with a serious face.
"I feel a personal connection when I hold a letter in my hands."
The graphic novel and Castle in England document the life of families who stayed in the castle Scotney from the Middle Ages to the Eduardovského period. Each story is illustrated by a different British artist, Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first Rhodesova book inspired by archives: He is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection of British Library-inspired documents-a project that was very emotional for him.
"I was intrigued by an inch of a letter written by a double agent in 70. Years that worked for Jakobity, "he said.
"That's the fingerprint of his thumb!
And the letters always smell like smoke, because in those times you had to light a candle to read.
When you přičichnu to the letter now, about 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
How I love the archives! "
For someone who is so fascinated with old papers, the support of the National Trust and Arts Council England and the possibility to dwell almost four months in the castle is almost like a dream. ("To tell you the truth, I've lengthened my stay a little.")
Rhodes spent time exploring the Victorian "new" castle, browsing the archives and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as. Head hyenas on the wall and bottles that have been tossed for centuries in the ditch.
He walked over the land and examined the ruins of the old castle, spoke with Hajnými, gardeners, and occasionally with artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
At night "drinking whiskey and wrote".
The intimate History of Scotney is a relatively large unknown, as the National Trust has gained access to documents only in 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Husseyové.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the employees began to penetrate into the archives that Rhodes described by saying, as "aristocrats of many centuries frustration hands with the words: ' Take it to the attic '."
Diaries, letters from the days of the British Empire, a map showing the estates: "You may think that the dispute over land is boring," said Rhodes, "but I came across one case where two families přetahovaly about Břízu.
Stop the People! "
Some stories in the book Use the castle as a springboard and delve deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which tracks a man who leaves a newly built castle to join the English uprising of 1381.
"I found a record of rebellion in the castle from the year 1380, which was in the book called Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," Rhodes said.
"The English uprising actually started in this area and it occurred to me that rebellion is a good starting point.
Maybe they are somehow connected together. "
Other stories are firmly linked to the history of the castle-for example, The priest, who tells the story of the Jesuit priest, whose hid Darrellova family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or the Smuggler about a smuggler from the 18th A century named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled the coffin with stones (which was discovered until several years after the uncovering of the coffin).
Rhodes's favourite family is Darrellovy: "I was intrigued by a man's generation-men were always indebted and spent money on things they couldn't afford.
The various generations of Darrell's family solved it by marrying a rich or old wives-I imagine that they were handsome gentlemen who liked Motali head dědičkám. "
With the end of their stay at the castle searching Rhodes after other adventures.

And then there is the sexual robotic woman Roxxxy Gold company True Companion, which comes with pre-programmed personalities, including "frigid Farrah", which is characterized by a shy character and "wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" nature.

As far as possible, sex robots are to resemble real women (albeit with categories rates).
Their creators are konstruují so that they are pleasant to the touch and acted at first glance as a real woman.
But when it comes to their "personality," the robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no work or history. Nothing to encourage their independence or to disturb their devotion to their master.
In other words, they're nice slaves.

What were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I had to evaluate it at school, three.
I didn't catch the first year, I had an experienced goalie before me.
I was learning.
The second year I started to catch.
The third season I thought they'd give me more space.
But they brought a new goalie with whom I alternated again.
Last year, I assumed I was still catching.
But during the introductory ten games we only gained five points, so the coaches started to spin.
At the end, he was more caught by my colleague.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to ohrát him for the next season.
How was life in Riga?
Wonderful.
It's a little Prague.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I'll miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.

How challenging is KHL for goalkeeper?
The first ten teams are really good quality.
Then there are teams like us or Slovan that must change their playing style.
The skill is on the other hand, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing more backwards, fighting harder.
I didn't see a problem in the pitch.

Then it was a classic.
We had fun with different teams, but they decided to do something for someone else in the final.

Anything can happen.
Let's see what will be in the month where you vyvrbí.

The government drift continues in the years.
In January of this year I am in an article with due diligence? He wrote MJ. And the camp in the years of Orlík.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so I allow the pivotal passages of the article to remind.
We've been talking about camp in years.
For readers who do not know exactly what is going on, it will probably be best if they look eg. On the official site of the Cultural Monument Memorial Place flights.
There, in the introduction of the historical overview, they learn that the camp was two kilometres east of the village years ago that from 8. 8.1940 served as a labour camp, from 1. 1.1942 was a collection camp and from 2. 8.1942 became a cikánským camp.
The next text describes the course of life in Tábor, including inhuman conditions, until March 1943, when the first Letští prisoners were included in the osvětimského transport.
On 4 May 2004. 5.1943 the largest transport to the extermination camp was transported 370 persons.
In total there were 420.
A very sad history of the immense hardships of human beings that caused them to turn human beings and perverse ideologies.
It is not disputed that these events must be constantly reminded.
There is no dispute or that such a reminder should take place at the memorial at the site experienced the suffering of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
In socialism, the camp was somehow forgotten and at 70. Years 20. The century was in the vicinity and part of the former camp built Vepřín.
The history of Tábor was randomly discovered in 1992 by American Paul Lansky, in the year 1995 was a monument in the years.
In the middle of 90. Years 20. Century promised the government the buyout and demolition of Vepřína, but so far has not happened.
In 1998, the monument was declared a cultural monument, and since 2009 its administration falls under the Lidice memorial.
In July 2013 the United Nations Committee on Human Rights called on the Czech Republic to close the Vepřín.
So many very succinct facts about the postwar fate of the camp.
Until last fall, the government approved the buyout of Vepřína and decided to draw up an expert opinion to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the Vepřín government then buys.
According to the Minister of Culture Herman, "some numbers exist, but I would probably thwart those intentions if I went to the public with them."
Let's see what the expert opinion will bring.
Some unofficial estimates may be hundreds of millions, according to others, the price can reach as much as a billion.
Anyway, it's not going to be a cheap affair.
And only a few hundred meters from the former camp stands a monument, to which the state invested almost ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the entire transaction was financed by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is probably not the case, it would have been the same way of throwing money.
Doesn't the government have other priorities?
The memorial, a dignified place of worship, is worth the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy and anyone who wants to be able to worship the memory of the suffering and the murdered.
I see no reason to change this!
Let's leave it as it is, and keep the place of piety with the utmost care.
Entrusted property, i.e. taxpayers ' money, should be treated by a responsible person, in this case the Government of the Czech Republic, with due diligence.

Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can alleviate the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
But the new study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
An incurable disease that affects up to 1.3 million U.S. residents and 300 000 patients in the UK, causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded to alleviate the symptoms of nepožívali meat and dairy products. However, the researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps create immune cells that support bowel resistance.
A study director, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure the degradation of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that support tolerance and protect the body without impairs sensitive tissue.
Inflammatory bowel disease may occur once the scales have been tilted to the side of the inflammation.
As part of the research researchers found the presence of immune cells supporting body tolerance in the stomach mice with specific bacteria.
This bacterium requires the presence of tryptophan-one of the building blocks of proteins to create cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We found a connection between one species of bacteria-Lactobacillus reuteri-which is a common part of the intestinal microbiome and the development of cells that support body tolerance.
The more tryptophan they had mice in their diet, the more they had these immune cells. "
At the same time, he suggested that if it turns out that the same applies to humans, then the combination of L. reuteri and diet rich in tryptophan helped develop permissive and less inflammatory intestinal environment.
Postgraduate researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwasová in the study of a certain type of immune cells supporting body tolerance, it appeared that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of identical mice kept separate cells Lacked.
It deduced from the fact that one group of mice has different intestinal mikrobiom-a community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that commonly dwell in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines were tested by the method of DNA sorting and researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells that lacked a second group of mice.
Mice, which were bred in a sterile environment and lacked them intestinal mikrobiom-they did not develop this type of immune cells-they were given the bacteria L. reuteri-and they formed the immune cells.
To understand how the bacterium affects the immune system, the researchers have cultivated L. reuteri in the fluid and then transferred a small amount of fluid-free bacteria-to undeveloped immune cells that were kept in isolation.
The immune cells have evolved into tolerant cells.
After removal of the active ingredient from the liquid it was shown that it is a byproduct of tryptofanového metabolism known as indolyl acid-3-acetic.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mouse diet, the number of these cells rose by 50 percent. At the same time, recommends halving doses tryptophan decreased by half the number of cells.
Dr. Cervantes-Barraganová explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice and most of us keep the bacteria L. reuteri in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known if by-products tryptophan from the L. reuteri bacteria cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in tryptophan genes have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barraganová added: "Each of us should probably strive to develop these cells because they control the inflammatoryness of the inner surface of the intestines.
A potentially high level of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may increase the population of cells. "
José Mourinho regards the signing of the contract with Nemanjem Matićem and his transfer to Manchester United for ' genius '
Manchester United got to his team "genius" in the form of Nemanja Matiće-at least he thinks José Mourinho after the midfielder debuted in the Wednesday's match against Sampdorii.
Matić, who signed a 40 million contract, said at the first match a 2:1 prize in Dublin-the last pre-season match before the UEFA Superpohárem, where United meeted on Tuesday with real Madrid-and acted as a midfielder alongside Paul Pogby and Andreas Pereira.
However, since he did not participate in the team's pre-season Asian Tour, Matić had no form and played for only 45 minutes, which, in the words of Mourinho, must be worked out before the start of the next Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he's experienced, intelligent and has genius thinking – he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get in shape as soon as possible."
Like Matić, his new teammates Victor Lindelöf and Romelu Luka also played the first game at Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho is slowly starting to shape his 11th for the next season.
An independent resource announced this week that Mourinho wants to continue to sign a contract with three other players, but insists that the club did a "fantastic job" and brought three of the four most important players to the team.
"Thank you to the club that helped me to get three of the four players," he added.
"Four of the four would please me more, but I accept that they did the best for me."

If he had my face there, I'd be laughing a lot.

White House prop cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
The White House decision to fly with the Navy helicopter at South Lawn to commemorate the American manufacturing industry, which took place last month, came according to the records of the Navy, published by TIME magazine, at 24 000 $.
The greener Sikorsky VH-3d helicopter, also known as the Marine One in the presence of the President on board, was the culmination of a program from the 17th July in the White House, which was a showcase of American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, vice president of Mike Pence, and several senior White House officials obhlíželi a showcase of products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut helicopter was exhibited next to a yacht from Maine, a fire car from Wisconsin and a vidlicovitého button lift cart from Mississippi.
A White House military officer issued a fragmentary order or frag, and applied for a helicopter presence of less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn as part of an "extraordinary" event, the records reported Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) Responsible for helicopter management.
"I wanted to make sure you had an awareness of such a significant event," wrote Commander HMX-1 in an email to his superior, deputy commander of the Navy's aviation day before the start of the event.
The report indicated that the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn 17. On 1 July 7:00, the show was scheduled to start at 15:00 and will remain in place until the complete clearing of the whole place, planned between 18:00 and 21:00.
In the e-mail, it was also said that if there was a delay in departure from the White House, a replacement crew will be sent for the return flight due to the working time regulations.
The original crew remained on the spot that evening, along with the helicopter, and together with them a unit of security workers.
From the records-which was won by TIME magazine-it was not noticeable if the second crew was finally seconded.
The Hatch ACT prevents state officials from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 investigates possible violations of this regulation.
"We were wondering if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were reassured that everything is in order," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like they've blocked you," the deputy commander wrote back.
This "Made in America" show was marked as an official event by the White House and the Hatch Act would not apply to it.
But even official events have political subtexts.
In his participation in the event, the president pursued a medical reform that was passed by the Senate and spoke of the effort to keep the government decrees at bay.
The use of air transport means such as Marine One or Air Force one for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when traveling.
But their presence purely for presentation reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered a check in February after the presidential plane drove in the background during his first first meeting in a campaign in Melbourne, Florida. His Twitter account is overwhelmed by complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessors.
"The White House is delighted by the parade of ' Made in America ', which introduced products from all the 50 states that Americans produce from American materials," said Deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.
The HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landing in the Washington area and South Lawn, and practice possible arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum precision.
While Trump took part in the G-20 summit at the beginning of July in Germany, HMX-1 made a 58 training landing at the White House.
A flight to show Made in America was part of the crew's current training, state officials said.
The same day, the helicopter unit flew another eleven hours in the "nonpresidential support missions".
The White House said the taxpayers ' money was not covered by any other props.
The Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not in any way engage in in the helicopter exposure negotiations at South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep a budget record for presidential flights and the exact costs in connection with the parade are difficult to determine according to the Navy's observations.
According to the Ministry of Defense, the hourly price for the fiscal year is 2017, reimbursement of DoD expenses for VH-3d 24 380 $ per flight hour.
The Unit records shall indicate a time of 30 minutes from the base of the Marine Corps Air facility Quantico in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of the helicopter are significantly below the stated amount.
"Putting taxpayers ' costs on the basis of estimates for reimbursement of expenses is very misleading," Walters said to the whole thing.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual cost."
According to a 2015 RAND study, reimbursement of DoD expenses does not include personnel costs, but includes fuel price, maintenance and contract costs.
Then the White House press Secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for parade purposes.
"The Idea of the show that takes place this week is to present the products produced in the U.S.," Spicer said.
"I am aware that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to the defense of our state and that they provide work to hundreds, if not thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we pride ourselves on helicopters and other military facilities whose production is involved in countless American citizens.
This fact is to be recalled. "
It's not clear if Trump was to look for a helicopter during his walk to South Lawn. It is certainly only possible to say that he sat behind the wheel of one of the fire wagons.
Back in the White House Trump approached a representative of Sikorsky and quipped with the media about their own fleet of products.
"I know the Sikorsky very well," said the president, "his own three."
A young woman grounded off in a swamp near Macha Lake, the police brodila to her.
The girl set off to the beach on Sunday roughly around the second hour of the morning.
Instead of bathing, she remained trapped in wetlands.
When she decided to ask a mobile phone for help from a police officer, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"For that reason, the police soon lost their connection," said the police spokesman Ivan Jodie.
There were a few police patrols, but finding a young woman was not easy at all.
"Some of the policemen had to Wade Reed wetlands hundreds of meters before they felt solid ground again," Jodie approached.
And so was the missing.
The police were oriented according to the direction of her call for help.
"Not to lose this connection at least," said the spokesman, talking to her that he would be counted aloud.
The cops found the woman in the three quarters of five in the swamps of the born.
She was on the verge of physical and psychological forces and seemed to be undercooled.

Not only Gazdík long defined against ANO Andrei Babiše, but at the first joint press conference, the old man, who Babiše publicly praised, said, as follows: "My goal is to make the movement yes, so the mayoral movement has won twenty per cent in the forthcoming elections."
Let's hope he didn't get confused with the movement.
The old man is a successful entrepreneur and the billionaire is certainly not by chance.
They often talk about politics like Babiš, but, unlike it, it does not build its own political brand.
The tent has been reminded of a reality show for some time than a real political party, and a Dědkova helping hand seemed to be making the wanted bride even more a sales girl.

Donald Trump nodded against Russian sanctions.
The day before, the US embargoed sanctions for Venezuelan President Maduro.
And a day earlier Trump wrote that China did nothing to North Korean the threat, and that it would not go on.
Even oozes thought of sanctions like straw from shoes.
These things can't be thrown in one bag.
Madurova Venezuela really set off on the path to dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China will only leave the way that the US President wished.
Russia is a chapter to itself.
But if it were to be summed up so that even a normal voter, American, European, or otherwise, understood what it was and what rule system was based on sanctions, it would be almost impossible.
In the sanctions against Russia, Trump only renachystals what President Obama has already done, he just gave an implementing stamp.
So why the fuss?
Last year, Europe was terrified of winning America's Trump election, embracing Putin, and withdrawing sanctions.
A horrible idea.
In practice, however, it is the opposite.
With Trump, sanctions are not released but tightened.
But Europe is even more frightened.
German minister Zypries says that Trumpovy sanctions violate international law.
How kosher are the sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But the EU's Antirussian sanctions are not kosher.
European Commission head Juncker complains that Trumpovy sanctions endanger the EU's energy security.

Common selector grope.
Three years heard that the fate of Antirussian sanctions depends only on the implementation of the Minsk ceasefire agreements in Ukraine.
It is now dovídá that this is the EU's energy security.
The grope selector is also wider.
Sanctions come to Russia for being too assembled where it doesn't.

A lot of representatives and national politicians have upset your theses that directly elected mayors and mayors should drive municipalities and cities themselves, only with managers.
You mean that?
It wasn't like that.
I am a fan of direct democracy, we choose the President directly, and I believe that we should also vote for mayors and mayors alike.
I'm not talking about canceling representatives in my book, they can be there.
The question is, how many will be.
In presenting your book about what I dream of, when I happen to sleep, I hear on my own ears that you talked about the abolition of councils.
I don't remember.
I was talking about the direct choice and reduction of the number of representatives.
New York, with nine million inhabitants, has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague with 1.2 million citizens has 1171 representatives.
And the mayor is summing up that she has little to build and not prepare large projects, but she has no competence for it.
The same is true of the government, which was managed only by two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
I'm not saying they did it well.
But the current prime Minister does not obey anything, he merely moderates the debate.
So it can't work.
Is that why you want to enforce a majority system?
It would be ideal, but it's hard to get through.
In the program we have only a change to Jednokolovou choice in the Senate.
We have also proposed a sliding mandate for ministers and an adaptation of the chamber's rules of procedure to prevent unnecessary exhibicím of MEPs to work mainly in commissions and committees, not to show off at chamber meetings.
It is certainly not true that I want to destruovat the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents are worried about.
That as a dictator you will manage the government, control the deputies with 101 deputies, cancel the shire and the Senate, and through grateful mayors and mayors you have mastered the whole country.
I'm sure it's not.
There's nothing wrong with debating the number of MEPs.
French President Macron reported the reduction of the legislature by one-third, while there are 57 thousand Frenchs per legislature, while in our country it is based on 17 thousand Czechs.
But no one accuses Macrona of endangering democracy.
Even if someone won the election majority in the Czech Republic, we have mechanisms that would prevent him from making any dramatic changes.
Leads for whoever has a parliamentary majority are great, just look into Poland or Hungary.
No such thing in the case of a movement yes.
We just need a team that will work in government for people, not for their parties or resorts.
I do not understand why we have failed to agree that only salaries of teachers, staff in culture and social services will be raised.
Why have they overvoted me and added 21% to the members of GIBS who already take 60 thousand?
Would you like a Prime minister?
The Prime Minister has to intervene when ministers behave imeconomically, confuse government with the travel agency, and for the money of the state would like to take as Marian Jurecka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers are not supposed to argue in government, and contradictions are to be called out.
There must be a finished material in the cabinet, where there is no room for a coalition split, a force vote and a deal, there is a decision to make.
How do you want to have a cohesive team when ministers behave mainly in the party?
The constitutional law is above the parties.
When it came to the breaking of bread, Sobotka said that the Coalition treaty did not apply and set off the Babiše of the government.
This can be done by every prime minister.
But if he is a personality and has managerial abilities, similar false gestures are not needed.
It measures everyone as well and requires perfect performance from all.
Do you know who you would suggest to the Treasury Secretary?
I don't think about it, because we don't think we'll even be in that government, nobody wants to work with us, even if I don't know what I've done.
So much skepticism is not in place.
The mayors have acquired entrepreneurs old man, who would like to cooperate with you, at Lidovců may win the wing to you inclined Jiří Čunek.
I don't think so.
The Social Democrats are led by Lubomir, who does not rule out the coalition, and in the ODS, Václav Klaus Jr., who will not be opposed, will be able to do so.
I'd leave it on the voters.
Deputy Prime Minister and vice chairman Yes Richard Brabec said that you have many common points with the SPD Tomia Okamury, for example in the field of economics.
So Okamurovci come into consideration as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say it like that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, he ran as a puppet vít Bárta for VV, then he gained money for his company from the dawn, there was a coup.
He's a distinct personality, of course.
But rather brownish.
When I take his program, there is a wide involvement of people in the management of the company, a direct democracy that can be agreed.
I'm not asking you to do that.
Am I interested in whether you are an acceptable person who has xenophobic opinions, may rant on demonstrations with gallows and wants to get out of the EU?
We don't think about cooperation with Mr Okamury, I can't imagine.
Obviously, he went into politics to profit from it.
What about the silent support of the communists to your minority government?
I can't imagine that, but they decide the voters.
It will be about negotiating the winner with the second in order, but God knows who will be the winner and who the deuce.
Of course, it is important that they be able to agree on a coalition government program.
Let us return to your quest to manage the state as a company.
But the government just has to follow, Minister Sobotka left everything to rot, never decided.
Coalition issues such as CEB or EGAP did not work.
After all, Sobotka is his puppet, and that was the reason why he threw me out.
As soon as he did so, ČEZ dominated the Czech government.
It is unbelievable that the Prime Minister brought a resolution written by ČEZ Management, which obliges the Minister of Finance to vote at the general meeting of Čez.
If you become prime minister, you change the staffing conditions on the supervisory board and change the top management of ČEZ?
Christ, if I'm going to be prime minister, he'll see.
I'm not that yet.
Grapevine that ČEZ has already sent signals in your direction.
Good cooperation with the CSSD would like to exchange for even better with Yes.
For example, after the election, everything goes on.
I don't know anything about it.
I have no lobbyist of humble or Růžičku, I am a separate unit and I do not solve this at all.
Then answer directly.
If you become the head of the government, will you seek to exchange the leadership of ČEZ, Czech television or the general health insurer, the institutions you criticize?
I would like ČEZ to be a transparent company.
So far, he has been doing what he wanted for years, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
It is enough to trace the statements of Mr Schwarzenberg.
Although he has a state in ČEZ majority, he never drove him, he was only in number, which is wrong.
It's a trivial matter for me.
ČEZ has taken Dukovany, valued them, shove them into subsidiaries, arrange funding, make a supply competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The concept that the State has to fund and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
and Czech television?
Some of her shows are leading a permanent purpose campaign against me, but I don't have any competence to throw someone out.
But to dominate yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay about 7.2 billion a year for public radio and television, but they don't really know how these institutions manage.
How do they not know?
The Chamber of Deputies approves the report on their management, which has a direct influence on the positions of the Directors-General of CT and Czech radio.
Look how these messages are discussed, the Super Power pact Sobotka Kalousek, who always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary Commission on the evasion of the investigative files and to the Lex Babiš.
and Sobotka was so stupid that he let Kalousek push to throw me out of the government, which won a percentage of TOP 09, but the CSSD is Ubralo.
They are afraid of disrupting their corrupt system, so they talk about the threat of Babišem democracy.
No one is immune.
What do you say to articles describing how the first Vice-president Yes Jaroslav Faltynek is building the power background by putting his son in the supervisory board of heating plants Brno and arranging a related lawyer Květoslavu clay contract with City and state companies, such as Prague Transport company or Czech railways?
We have a permanent dispute.
