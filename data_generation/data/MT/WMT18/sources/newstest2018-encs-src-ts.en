Local people mobilization for China’s reforestation project
We use resource mobilization theory to analyze local farmers’ motivation in participating China’s reforestation project.
Samples from the Province of Ningxia and Beijing were interviewed and their environmental awareness, relationship nets, media access, and attitudes toward the reforestation project were collected.
It is shown that collective psychological grievance of environmental degradation does exist and can serve as the mobilizing basis.
Besides, close network between city and rural areas and mass media could help enhance such mobilization.
However, economic compensation is still indispensible in the promotion process of the reforestation project
Key Words : reforestation project, China, people mobilization, environmental awareness
Introduction
The Yellow River, the second longest river in China, is often compared to China’s Mother River.
Millennia ago, Chinese civilization emerged from along this river.
And now it drains a basin of 795,000 sq km, which nourishes 120 million people.
However, the Yellow River has become a danger river.
In the middle reaches, the Yellow River flows across the heavily eroded Loess Plateau and takes away excessive silt.
This accounts for over 90 percent of the sediment in the main channel downstream.
The increasing sediment deposits have raised the riverbed several meters over the surrounding grounds.
Traditional efforts in taming the river concentrate on flood prevention by raising and strengthening levee embankments lining both the north and south shores of the channel.
Although the levee built higher and higher, more and more floods threaten this river and the people living along it.
After the massive flood in 1998, Chinese government recognized that only by modifying the Aeolian loess could we eradicate the problem of Yellow River’s flood.
Thus, a greening policy aiming at turning cultivated farmland into forest and grassland surfaces around 1999.
Now, this policy has spread to 25 provinces in China.
According to this policy, farmers in specific areas should stop farming or grazing and plant trees or grass on their land.
Most of these areas are vulnerable to wind or rainfall erosion.
And farmers could get cash and grain from the government as compensation accordingly.
While this policy brings a sound beginning of China’s soil conservation and environmental improvement, its sustainability still remains a problem.
If the policy’s performer, say the local farmers, could not identify with this policy, they would cut down the trees and re-cultivate crops on the land after the compensation period.
If it is the case, the reforestation program would make no sense except wasting huge amount of public financial resources for several years.
This paper tries to examine Chinese farmers’ identification with the reforestation and other environmental policies.
Although the formulation and execution of the reforestation policy are governmental behaviors, the analysis from a social movement perspective would cast some light on this issue.
The peasant population in China is very large and most of them live on a self-satisfying basis, so the cost of external supervision on them is really high.

Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has put out an alert for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, effective through August 28th, 2017, calls for African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the state given the series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently, and noted therein," the group's statement reads.
A recent Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement disproportionately targeting minorities prompted the group to issue the travel alert, the NAACP said.
"You have violations of civil rights that are happening to people.
They're being pulled over because of their skin color, they're being beaten up or killed," the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told The Kansas City Star.
"We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven't heard before."
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.
The group cited incidents such as racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling through the state, and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The advisory also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the state were 75 percent more likely to be pulled over than whites.
"The advisory is for people to be aware, and warn their families and friends and co-workers of what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be ready, whether it's bringing bail money with them, or letting relatives know they are traveling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, ranking the state at 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain people on immigration violations which the ACLU said would increase racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, advocacy groups have resorted to the measure in response to certain laws and trends inside the US.

Model killed by a chef.
Twelve years later, her family still has no peace!
The victim is model Sally Anne Bowman.
The Croydon-born girl was murdered in 2005 in the restaurant where she worked by chef Mark Dixie, who stabbed her.
Both the victim and the killer had sex and smoked marijuana, then he killed her.
The killer then sat in a nearby café and watched the painstaking investigation of the crime scene.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced to a 34-year prison term in 2008 for the rape and murder of the model Sally.
He only confessed to assaulting the young woman to the court, and his lawyer claimed that his client had found the dead girl lying on the street already dead.
The police convicted him three years later.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson were fighting on the fateful night.
The murderer said, "He was really upset, and after he attacked her the girl started screaming."
"She even caught the attention of the taxi driver," he falsely stated.
According to his testimony, the girl defended herself as best she could, but it was in vain.
Lewis supposedly stabbed her on the street.
Dixie's version was been proven to be a lie and inculpated him.
After he confessed, Dixie spoke of his desire and lust for the girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt happy and had to smoke marijuana.
Before the incident with Sally, he had been with his former girlfriend, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, as Dexie himself revealed to the police.
He said that he felt adrenalin.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth," Linda added the Mirror.

Michigan is a particularly poignant example of the potential consequences of this new system, and it might just be the tip of the iceberg — vanquished are the stable, stodgy patriarchal companies like the Big Three,pervasive $20 an hour an hour wages and secure lifetime employment.

When it was first built, General Motors's auto manufacturing plant at Willow Run near Ypsilanti was called the Grand Canyon of mechanized America, the eighth wonder of the world, and something like the scene of a tragedy, — that was the socialist's response as Richard Sennett describes it in his book The Corrosion of Character.
A colossal symbol of the success of democratically regulated capitalism, Willow Run was like a culmination of the old-world order, immensely productive, devoid of any creativity or freedom of thought, and beautifully stable.
Even though Sennett's socialist observer thought the routine of the assembly line was stifling, Willow Run and plants like it were also the site of worker's empowerment.
Rigid rules about exact pay set the scene for the emergence of the nation's most powerful union, in whichemployees knew exactly where they stood.
Without being nostalgic, Sennett described the essence of life on the assembly lines.
Routine can demean, but it can also protect; routine can decompose labor, but it can also compose a life,

Designer vibrators cost tens of thousands of crowns.
"Czechs are neither prudish nor conservative," says Martin Ráž, who runs the Intimity boutique in Prague.
In it, you will find designer and luxury erotic aids,
including those by Czech designer Anna Marešová.
It began inconspicuously about 12 years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friends went on a bike tour in Moravia.
However, one of them did not just bring a bicycle, but also a box full of unusual looking vibrators.
"There were various kinds of moles and dolphins, and everything was green and yellow, and everything was totally different," he told me during lunch.
His friend had decided to work as a partner to Fun Factory, the German manufacturer of designer sex toys, which attracted Martin, who offered to help with marketing.
When his associate left to take up another position, he replaced him.
Today he runs the Intimity boutique in Prague's Benediktská ulice, where he sells sex toys in the way luxury handbags or shoes are often presented.
And why not?
They are also designer items.
One second, are you asking yourselves, “is this what you talk about over lunch?”
Come on, don’t be such puritans!
It was the Fun Factory store in Berlin, which was designed by renowned designer Karim Rashid, that served as the inspiration for the Intimity boutique.
It opened in 2010 and was based on a completely different concept of the erotic store to what everyone is used to here.
There are no hidden displays, and everything is done in a beautiful, decent way, with the products exhibited like in a perfume store.
Martin and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka began to think about how to get hold of a shop in Prague, where it should be and what it should be called.
Both of them liked the name Intimity.
"It's related to intimacy, and I would say it is gentle," he said.
The next step was to purchase the internet domains and look for a suitable space that would work in parallel with the various visualisations of the interior.
In the end, the variation that won saw the shop displayed as a garden of delights and a bedroom, dominated by beds.
Dagmar Štěpánová from the FormaFatal studio made it for us.
We found the space in 2013.
At first we thought it wasn't ideal, because it wasn't on the high street, but it was thanks to that that we came up with the name Intimity.
It's intimate.
It's in the street near to the high street, so no one can stare at the customers," commented Martin Ráž.
We wanted to be the first.
We wanted to create a shop that would be different, with good, branded products, in an environment where women, who are our main customers, feel comfortable.
It should be the kind of shop they aren't ashamed to enter.
When I went to the Intimity boutique half an hour earlier, the streets were empty.
I didn't even have the feeling that I was going to a shop with sex toys.
As soon as I got to the door I was surprised by the clean elegance of the interior, which I know from fashion boutiques.
Even though only women work in the shop, so that women do not hesitate to ask for help, that doesn't mean that men can't step foot in it.
Gentlemen mainly go to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
"Men usually can not guess the right size, and they usually opt for one that is too big," chuckled Martin over the frequent mistake.
This cliche refers back to a preconception that women need big sexual aids, but it isn't true.
So although they have good intentions, men usually choose an unnecessarily big vibrator.
Likewise, men mostly pick out black underwear, while women usually tend towards pink colours.
The absolute bestseller at the moment is the appropriately named Satisfyer.
The expression on my face must have made it clear that I didn't which kind it was, as Martin immediately explained how it works.
It is a kind of contactless clitoris stimulator.
I feel the adolescent need to chuckle with admiration for the serious tone with which my comment is handled.
As if it didn't phase him at all.
At it really doesn't.
It is affordable and has perfect reviews from its users.
We couldn't believe it was so well received.
It's like the most recent innovative revolution.
The first revolution saw vibrators in the shape of a seahorse.
It paid attention to the fact that women were starting to be interested in the design of these kinds of products.
The second was the We-Vibe vibrator for couples.
It completely shattered the taboo that had been persisting among some men who saw erotic aids as competition.
"They make various kinds," he continued.
With one motor, with two motors, and with remote control.
That's the most popular category.
While making love together, both men and women can have the control in their hand and alter the intensity of the vibrations.
On the other hand, the category of penetrative vibrators was a complete washout,
at least for us.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose aids and buy classic vibrators, although they are only used externally.
It is very popular in Western Europe, especially among younger customers.
And what about men?
It's hard to say, but it seems like this kind of concept would also work exclusively for men.
It might have to be conceived in a slightly different way, however.
The question is what to offer men," mulled Martin.
"We have aids for them too, but only to a limited extent." Masturbators are the most sold, in our case those produced by Tenga.
It doesn't look like an anatomical imitation of a vagina but "more like a shower gel or an egg, or some kind of futuristic object.
There is a lot of focus on functionality and user experience.
It's completely different in Japan, however.
It really surprised me.
I thought the Japanese women were very picky about sex toys.
"That's the Internet reality," he explained to me.
Banal truth is quite different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are generally associated with being used by women.
In Japan, they're absolutely normal for men, but they're taboo for women. Out of interest, of the products by the Japanese brand Tenga worldwide, which can be found in the Intimity boutique, about half is sold in Japan.
In our waters
Czech men and women aren't at all prudish.
On the contrary, we are a very openminded country.
There's definitely a difference from countries such as Catholic Poland or Italy.
A typical client of the store is between 35 and 50 years and "has some experience with both sex life and using toys.
They come for something nice and high quality, either for a fulfilling life with partner or just for themselves. To ensure that these customers keep coming back, Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdeňek Šebelka take care to check every product to make sure it's actually functional.
We don't want to get involved in any specialism, such as bondage or latex, because we don't have a place for that, it doesn't exactly fit.
These things might dissuade the people we're trying to attract.
These are people were always too shy to go to a sex shop because they worried that they would find something like that staring them in the face.
The variety of products displayed on the shelves is really appealing.
It's also achieved through the selection of appropriate, renowned brands.
Some of them have even won awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The very first to win a prize was the aforementioned sea horse, "and that triggered change across the industry.
Manufacturers stopped using cheap materials, and instead began working a healthy approach. They started producing different designs, in various colours...
It's enjoyable to know that a Czech woman was behind the design, specifically the popular designer Anna Marešová.
I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised how many people buy the designer Whoop.de.doo products by Anna Marešová from us, even though they are relatively expensive.
There are customers who go directly to the Venus Balls by Anna Marešová.
She did a really great job by presenting exactly what we are trying to present in the Czech Republic and abroad - that erotic aids can be made differently and nicely, with a story.
Anna's story started as a school project.
Now it is a finished product that is produced in our country.
I wanted to have control over the production process and I also wanted to know with what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Because it is not large-scale but rather small series, which is certainly more expensive than a big series.
Maybe I'm going against the current a bit, but it seems important to me to keep the development in the Czech Republic.
It may well be that in a few years we will no longer be able to produce anything." This is how Anna described the situation later, agreeing with Martin that our society is becoming more open.
She isn't faced with a positive or negative attitude.
At most, people are embarrassed.
"But then they will start to smile." At present, Anna Marešová range includes a vibrator that can come with a personal message, and she is also planning her own lubrication gel for next year.
Next year, she plans to offer vibrating eggs and other new items.
The border of healthy sex
I'm interested in where the border lies of what's acceptable.
Is there something that Martin Ráž wouldn't sell?
That's very hard to define.
What seems normal to one person may seem totally abnormal to someone else, so we define ourselves by our assortment of branded products.
None of them are particularly extreme.
Before we say goodbye, I have one last question: What was the craziest request they received?
We just received an email, in which a woman requested a masturbation aid for her boyfriend, who was 28 cm long by nature.
We had to reply that we don't have anything appropriate, unfortunately.
But the question remains if someone was making fun of us," said Martin, casting me a suspicious look.
It happens from time to time...
A blow for Karel Gott.
After two cases of cancer, now Alzheimer's!
His friend Karel Štědrý is fighting the serious illness.
Karel Gott's best friend is fighting against the disease that robs people of all their memory.
"Yes, unfortunately it's true," the singer himself told Blesk, confirming the sad information.
I know about my illness, and I can handle it all given the circumstances.
"I'm taking medication to slow down the side effects of the disease," he said, thanking his loved ones for their support.
The whole branch of the family has come together to make life easier for Karel.
His wife Eva tries to be at home as much as possible, while Zuzana and Teresa, his daughters from his first marriage go to his house on Bílá Hora, and his son Karl, nicknamed Karlas, takes care of him.
Štědrý fought cancer twice and shared his experience with Slavík to support him in his demanding treatment.
He has completed 60 rounds of chemotherapy.
Afterwards, he was able to go back to working on the tennis court and the ski slopes.
"An astrologer predicted that I will have up to 90," Karel told Blesk.
He's a fighter.
He longs to keep singing.
"I keep repeating song lyrics so I won't forget them," Karel admitted.
The actress Květa Fialová is currently struggling against the same disease in a home.

The Chilean parliament ends the ban on abortions as the Constitutional Court passes a law.
Until now, there has been a total ban on aborting pregnancies in Chile, even for medical reasons.
"I am sorry that the lawmakers filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court, so that now there will be ten people deciding on what we have been arguing about in parliament for more than two years," complained Socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members, and at the end of August it should get a new president, who is close to the opposition according to the AFP.
The law abolishing the absolute ban on abortion was initiated by the current President Michelle Bachelet, and was approved by the Senate on 19 July.
The right-wing opposition then announced that it would appeal the law would at court, on the grounds that it violated the unborn child's right to live.
Members of parliament postponed the vote last month while the Joint Parliamentary Committee carried out an analysis.
MPs approved the draft on Wednesday and the Senate convened after them.
According to the new legislation, pregnancies can be ended in three cases: if the woman's life will be endangered, if the foetus has no hope of survival or if the pregnancy is the result of rape.
According to the Spanish paper El País, similar exceptions existed in Chile since 1931, which was before women were given the right to vote in 1949.
The total ban on abortions was introduced in 1989 by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just months before he left the presidential office.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world to enforce an absolute ban on abortion.
The others are Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
In El Salvador, for example, about 20 women are currently behind bars, serving prison sentences of up to 30 years for the termination of their pregnancies.
According to human rights defenders, many cases declared murder by the court are actually miscarriage.
The Critique of Bracht's Community Analysis
Community assessment is a critical step in understanding and analyzing a community's problems or needs before interventions are implemented.
Using an appropriate assessment tool can help health care providers diagnose community problems and identify its resources available to solve the problems.
Providers not only need to know how to use an assessment tool, but also understand the limitations and strengths of the tool, because a tool can shape the scope of their views toward a community.
This analysis examines the strengths and limitations of Bracht's Community Analysis Tool.
Bracht's community analysis is an assessment tool used in planning health promotion interventions in a community setting.
The author, Neil Bracht, has been a faculty of the University of Minnesota with years of experiences in dealing with both national and international health promotion projects.
The Community Analysis we will discuss later in this paper is adopted from his book Health Promotion at the Community Level:
New Advances (second edition) published in 1999.
This tool mainly focuses on seven components: (1) general community profile (i.e., socioeconomic data), (2) health and wellness outcomes profile (i.e., epidemiological indicators), (3) health risk profile (i.e., behavioral, social, and environmental risks), (4) community health promotion program survey, (5) specialized community studies (i.e., systemic surveys or key informants interviews), (6) study of community leadership, and (7) assessing readiness and capacity for change.
According to Bracht (1999, p.60) these components are fundamental parts in an analysis tool.
In the first edition of his book (1990), the first five components were categorized in quantitative data, and the last two components were in qualitative data; however, they were merged in the 1999 version.
Definitions
Community
A critical component of community assessment is to define community.
Community has been defined as a locality based entity composing of systems of formal organizations reflecting social institutions, informal groups, and aggregates, which are interdependent and whose function is to meet a wide range of collective needs (Stanhope&amp;
Knollmueer, 2001).
This definition depicts community as an entity which satisfies common needs of different systems.
Community is also often referred to as a geographic area within specific boundaries or social areas, as defined in Bracht's tool (Bracht, 1999, p.60).
His definition is based on two notions: first, a community focuses an assessment on space or boundaries, social institutions, social interaction, and social control; second, a community can be identified by arbitrary geographical boundaries, by their social relationships, or through the exercise of collective political power (Bracht, 1999, p.60).
Compared with Stanhope and Knollmueer using a system framework for analysis, Bracht explains analysis in a way of social-oriented rather than system-oriented, because Bracht much considers the influences of social interaction on the outcomes of programs carried out in a community.
An underlying assumption behind this perspective is that community analysis should be carried out with citizen's participations; further, decisions making should be in grassroots people's hands rather than experts' (Bracht, 1999, p.63).
In fact, the belief of this assumption is that citizens should take the responsibilities of identifying and addressing their community problems themselves.
In addition, his Community Analysis is based on community-focused rather than need-focused, emphasizing that a community is needed to be clearly defined before an analysis is made.
After a community is specified, we will discuss about the meaning of community health and the purpose of a community analysis.
Community Health
The purpose of community assessment is to identify problems and manage interactions within the community and between the community and the larger society, and meet needs; this process involves commitment, self-other awareness, clarity situational definitions, articulations, effective communication, conflicts containment and accommodation, participation, management of relations with the larger society, and facilitation of participant interaction and decision making (Stanhope&amp;
Knollmueller, 2001).
Needs are met is the essence of Stanhope and Knollmueller's definition of community health.

Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty
The surest mark of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
Americans appreciate this as well as anyone - hence the carefully stage-manged toppling of Saddam Hussein in Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically limit legal immigration.
In fairness, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat-trip owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he did.
But he did attack its meaning, and in particular the meaning ascribed to it when Emma Lazarus's famous poem was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument itself was completed.
As Miller scolded Acosta: "I don't want to get off into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American liberty lighting the world.
The poem that you're referring to, that was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, this is not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's startling words, the only ones in which a state has appeared to invite not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore."
There has never been a time when the "wretched refuse" has been more visible on our screens.
Miller was not engaging in literary criticism - he was making it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.
This conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is really a conflict about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were engaging in a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to mark the connections between French and American republicanism by representing in a well-worn classical trope, the female embodiment of Liberty.
Lazarus changed that meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of Exiles.
The marrying of the poem to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, rightwingers have long wanted to change it back.
The great loudmouth Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that Liberty is not inviting anyone in, but is rather an early neocon, taking the American flame out to the benighted world: "Lady Liberty is stepping forward.
She is meant to be carrying the torch of liberty from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not to light the way to the United States."
Rather unusually, Limbaugh actually hit on something.
The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of the angle of perception.
Lazarus's great imaginative act was to see it as it would be seen by exhausted, wretched but hopeful people on the decks of ships after long and often dreadful journeys.
It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to better their lives.
Her statue speaks back to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And of course, this is not the perspective Miller and Trump want ever to recognise.
Their torch is meant not to light the way, but to inflame the hatreds that are their only source of power.

Into the Light: Avedon’s Images of Inmates
It is necessary, while in darkness, to know that there is a light somewhere, to know that in oneself, waiting to be found, there is a light.
--James Baldwin, Nothing Personal
Photographer Richard Avedon is probably most widely known for his fashion photography and portraits of famous people.
An Avedon portrait is easily identifiable by its stark white background and the feeling one gets when viewing the image that Avedon has caught the subject in a fleeting moment of letting down her guard.
Because Avedon’s work is so commonly associated with fashion, celebrity, and this trademark aesthetic, viewing his grainy, reportage-style photographs of inmates taken in 1963 at the East Louisiana State Mental Hospital can be a jarring experience.
Not only does the subject matter veer from Avedon’s traditional area of interest, the look of the photos also drastically diverges from the high contrast, bold photographs that are so characteristic of Avedon’s major body of work.
Avedon authorized the publication of these photographs of mental patients in very few printed works.
The most prominent of these is Nothing Personal, a Civil Rights era photo-text Avedon created in collaboration with James Baldwin.
It is largely in the context of this publication that I will analyze these anomalous images of inmates.
My primary interest in these photographs revolves around questions of intention and effect.
Photographer Diane Arbus offers one perspective in this arena:
Everybody has that thing where they need to look one way but they come out looking another way, and that's what people observe.
You see someone in the street, and essentially what you notice about them is the flaw.
It's just extraordinary that we should have been given these peculiarities.
And, not content with what we were given, we create a whole other set.
Our whole guise is like giving a sign to the world to think of us in a certain way but there's a point between what you want people to know about you and what you can't help people knowing about you.
And that has to do with what I've always called the gap between intention and effect.
(Aperture Monograph)
This is certainly one formulation of the gap between intention and effect that could be discussed in terms of Avedon’s photographs, particularly those of famous people.
One could also view this gap in terms of the artists’ subjectivity rather than that of the person being photographed, and examine the gap between what the author intended to do when snapping the photograph and what, from the artist’s perspective, actually resulted.
But the most relevant intention and effect framework for analyzing this particular selection of Avedon photographs takes into account the positions of the photographer, the subject, and the spectator/viewer.
This investigation aims to examine the intention of the artist, here Avedon, in embarking on a photographic project, this collection of inmate images, and the effect the resulting collection has on the position of the subject and the response of the viewer.
This inquiry leads to larger questions about what Susan Sontag calls the ethics of seeing that photographs produce, or the shift in our understanding of what is worth looking at and what we have the right to observe (On Photography 3).
Gaining a greater understanding of the relationship between the intentions behind and effects of Avedon’s 1963 photographs of mental patients will help address the issue of when is it ethically justifiable to capture and share images of vulnerable people.
I want to begin with a broad claim: the intention behind Avedon’s photographs of mental patients is unclear.
World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of Team GB
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots made the GB team
UK Athletics' performance director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Championships squad will make "a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes "there's something special evolving" in Scotland and UK athletics must learn from that.
"We embrace it and we're trying to understand it and we'll push on that until we work it out," Black said.
"I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it's something to do with what they've done.
Scottish Athletics think it's something to do with what they've done.
British athletics: it's something to do with what they've done.
And the guy on the corner street, too.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will race against Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle was voted by the squad to be team captain.
"Eilidh is slightly modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, walked out of that room feeling hugely proud and really motivated.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally put into it were great."
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says it's "incredible" 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's previous best total of athletes at the worlds was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Middle-distance runner Muir is leading the way, having set five British and two European records in the past year.
She will go in the 1500m and the 5,000m.
Chris O'Hare, who runs in the 1500m, is another Scot to watch, following a great season that included victory at the British Team trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships, when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she's "hugely proud" of the fact so many of her compatriots have not only made the team, but, in some cases, will be challenging for medals and competing to make finals.
"The special thing about being team captain is that it was voted for by the other members of the team, so that it was such a huge honour anyway but to know that your teammates have voted for you and chosen you made it extra-special for me," she added.
"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who've made the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they're here as well-established athletes, athletes that are going to be looking to get on podiums.
As for my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think it went well.
I just drew on the fact that we're very lucky in this situation in that we've got a home World Championships.
So it's really just the importance of drawing on that home support and thriving on the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.
I'm getting a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such an amazing atmosphere out there."
Today the Supreme Court is often seen as wielding a substantial amount of power by definitively determining the constitutionality of laws made by our government and striking them down if they do not believe them to be in like with the Constitution.
Though it appears to be a considerable oddity that an unelected tribunal of eight would have almost unchecked power to determine what laws are ok and what laws are not, in today's current political and judicial culture it often seems to be the case.
An apprehension that might arise in the mind of someone concerned with adhering to the democratic process at least procedurally then might be, so how much power does the Supreme Court really have?
The answer is a two-pronged response that concerns direct and indirect affects of the Court.
Gerald Rosenberg makes an excellent argument for the lack of direct affects the Court is capable of unless under very particular, fortuitous circumstances.
He then also makes a case against the indirect affects that the court is capable of and proposes several arguments against many of the indirect affects of the Courts.
Rosenberg seems to underestimate two potential indirect affects of the Court though; their value in creating backlash that can eventually help a cause, and working with grass roots organization in order to sustain social movements that could otherwise be squelched without the help of the law.
As Rosenberg says in the first chapter of The Hollow Hope, as far as focusing on the court being an effective producer of significant social reform, there are claims about frequency and claims about conditions.
Rosenberg describes that to fully understand the role of the courts in producing significant social reform, we must focus on the latter,
1 There are certain conditions that must be in place for the court to have any direct affect on social change reform.
The first restraint is that they must convince courts that the rights they are asserting are required by constitutional or statutory language,
2 This first restraint proved to be a major stumbling block in the case of Rosa Parks.
The NAACP thought that they would seize upon the situation involving the arrest of Rosa Parks and use it as a focal point of a legal attack on the constitutional rights involved with being able to sit where you want on a public bus.
Unfortunately, the case kept getting tangled up in the local and state courts instead of reaching any type of constitutional level, and instead the court relied on a method commonly seized upon by state courts as a reason for not addressing a party's federal claim: Counsel had failed too comply with some rule of state procedure.
3 It was difficult to even get the issue to be considered on a constitutional level, let alone then prove that the constitutional language protected it.
The second restraint is that courts are wary of stepping too far out of the political mainstream.
4 The Court, while an independent institution, does rely at least in part on the federal government, and they are still subject to the system of checks and balances by Congress who by take action against them.
The Court does not often make decisions that more than 50% of the population is against because of the enormous amount of heat that would be generated by the populous and their representatives would mount against a widely unpopular decision.
The third constraint that Rosenberg mentions is that since the judiciary has no influence over either the sword or the purse… but merely judgment, litigants are faced with the task of implementing the decisions, and without compliance of the other branches of government, court decisions are often rendered useless given much opposition.
Blocking critics from Facebook: Don't run for public office, if you can't take heat from voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to start slamming him on everything from domestic policy to his political principles.
He chafed at the criticism, sure.
But he did not silence his critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington said, "the freedom of Speech may be taken away - and, dumb & silent we may be led, like sheep, to the Slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who needs to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's staff has blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who voiced their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was rich with a "who cares?" backlash.
"It's only Facebook," plenty of folks said.
But it matters.
And it especially matters when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state who is astonishingly popular.
He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He's shown a steady hand in leading his state and a stern adherence to principles.
He's also been pretty deft at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents, playfully debuting his hairless head after chemo treatments on his page.
So blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is a public forum, labeled as official and administered by staff members paid public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderating them.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful folks lashing out online.
The Post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And they're just that - real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, a business owner and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn't hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed in his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news items," she wrote in the comment section of The Post's news story.
"I also do not appreciate that idea that when a number of people comment on the same topic, they are immediately disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort, rather than recognized as a large group of concerned citizens."
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" others would probably call "advocacy."
The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It's a lot cleaner than the old days, when doing the same would have required sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arresting and silencing protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening, only digitally.
Hogan isn't the first public official to be criticized for defanging Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first landmark rulings on this issue came down last week in Virginia.
The chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a constituent from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin (R) also got a visit from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter.
This shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington's time, the era of affordable postage had an impact much like the Internet.
The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers hammered his leadership.
And even back then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
People using the pseudonyms "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers trashing Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his stand on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse lie at the very foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Czechs have quickly taken to free roaming, using more data abroad than at home.
Czechs consume more of their tariffs abroad than at home.
They travel in Austria most often, but in the summer season the consumption of data is dominated by Croatia.
While on holiday, they have more time to browse the web, and most of the time they are not able to connect to Wi-Fi under the breach umbrellas.
Beach and bathing, smart phone in hand.
This is how a typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks now that customers can use services by local operators as part of their home tariffs.
O2 recently released statistics painting this picture.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travellers abroad can access more data as part of their normal rate at home.
It's no wonder, then, that in Croatia, where a minimal amount of our countrymen go in winter, consumption of data rose by as much as fifty times this summer.
Italy ranked second in the list of consumed data.
Czechs use the most minutes calling from Germany, where they go to work a lot during the summer.
According to the Association of Czech Travel Agencies, 800,000 Czechs visit Croatia each year, making it our most popular holiday destination.
People have swapped their holiday books for sharing their experiences on their mobile phones.
The record was 7 July.
"Tens of millions of photographs were transferred with the data," said Silvia Cieslarová, director of the O2 mobile department.
Although Croatia comes first in terms of the volume of data, the highest number of Czech users can be found in neighbouring countries.
Austria is in first place, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is fourth and Italy sixth.
We go to Austria for hiking and active holidays, meaning we do not have much time to browse the internet.
"Most Czechs head through Austria towards the Adriatic," Cieslarová explained.
While the operator recorded a year-on-year growth in roaming charges, the number of phone calls remains much lower.
The number of minutes used while roaming double in relation to the previous year.
Germany dominates with a huge lead over other countries.
"Calls while roaming are more likely to be made by business customers on work trips," Cieslarová added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at Renaissance Club
Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comforts over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who led next door at Archerfield Links heading into the final round last year before losing out to Paul Eales, is attached to the new venue and is acting as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched Renaissance Club being built, and we're seeing it come to its glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course at its finest, it is in fabulous condition.
Jerry has done a fabulous job setting this place up.
He's a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time despite winning on both the European Tour and European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This does feel really special," said the Southport-based player.
"I didn't get to defend the Extremadura Open because that was taken off the schedule the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf in.
The memories from last year are coming back and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year.
It was a really special time and one we will always cherish."
Making his return to action on home soil is Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 earlier this year.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little bit more when you're playing at home," said Helensburgh man Orr.
"You want to do well; but you do feel that extra pressure.
I've really enjoyed playing again and I've played some solid golf.
I'm happy with how it's going so far."
Joining the trio in the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scots in the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Land of Gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden home in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai regency in the restive Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually just places a sweet potato - known locally as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half-an-hour, the charred tuber is retrieved and devoured with eager, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the mud floor - she has no furniture - which is where she also performs her daily chores, such as washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp.

It's a rare glimpse of daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was absorbed into Indonesia in 1969 following a controversial referendum, when just 1,026 elders were forced to vote through a public show of hands before occupying troops.

In 2003, the province was officially split into Papua and West Papua, with independent Papua New Guinea occupying the eastern part of the island.

"Before, we only wore leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and with some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's land of gold.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, lies just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province around the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined some $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua boasts timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
These riches are, however, a source of misery for Papuans, ensuring Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 investigation in The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan calls for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose, and are dealt with mercilessly.
According to rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands during the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region last year alone.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, contains testimony of atrocities committed the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture - rape and electrocution are especially popular, according to another report - and the brutal crushing of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have tightened as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
The province's 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but the demographic is changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado mixed-vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Local people struggle to compete.
"The migrants started to sell chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papuans," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.
"It made the native Papuans - the mama-mama [the women] of Papua - lose their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to address the inequalities and rights abuses in Papua during his election campaign in 2014.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's total 29 districts - including Paniai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But precious little has changed in Papua, and today local people feel betrayed.
"Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, with the expectation that he would fulfill our hopes for justice to be restored," You says.
In fact, Paniai suffered a nadir just two months after Jokowi's October inauguration.
On Dec. 7, 2014 a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorbike broke through the gloom.
The startled children told them that they should turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took umbrage at their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local Pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers, who had been drinking, chased and beat the group with their rifle butts, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, the nearby government Election Commission building was set ablaze, and things escalated the following day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance - running in circles and simulating birdsong - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters started hurling stones at police and military posts.
As tempers grew more heated, an order was sent to the soldiers through internal radio: "If the masses offer resistance more than three times, shoot them dead," it said, according to an official document seen by TIME that has not been released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and appealed for calm, imploring the crowd to go back home.
Nobody was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around I suddenly got shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired but says the bullet came from the ranks of amassed soldiers.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only goes by one name, told TIME somberly.
"I saw he was dead ... I kissed him."
The Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers were only "securing" their station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesperson, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
News of the killings only filtered through to Jakarta the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura, where he expressed sympathies with the victims' families and vowed to address the historic abuses in Papua.
"I want this case to be solved immediately so it won't ever happen again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up a non-judicial mechanism to settle historic human-rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the '90s and in early 2000s.
The point is we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes to go through," he said.
Then Wiranto backtracked when speaking to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he has no plans to establish a grievance mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "All will be settled by law," he said.
Wiranto, who the U.N. has indicted for "crimes against humanity" relating to more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said that 11 cases of human-rights violations in Papua have already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims greeted such claims with grim incredulity.
"I've been interviewed four times for the past three years, but there has been no progress at all," Yohanes says.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus echoed the view that people in Paniai are fearful of discussing the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After burying the bodies, the military came looking for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's neighboring Deiyai regency.
One person died and 17 others were wounded, including children, during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help transport an unconscious man to hospital.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw who drowned while he was fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.
Incensed villagers protested in front of the company's site office.
Police said the villagers threw rocks at officers, who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one.
"We were so panicked, we are afraid there will be revenge," 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured being hurried in, tells TIME.
"I have been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a troublespot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the tribal Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal peoples, who live sprawled across Papua's verdant central highlands.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans by launching sporadic attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders hail from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military in recent years, under the guise of "safeguarding national sovereignty."
Some never reappear.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty feeds the discontent.
The little rice on sale in Enarotali is too expensive for locals to buy.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat: mainly nota plus some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the job of the women, who each can maintain four or five fields of the sweet potato.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, with the rest sold in the local market.
Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papuans and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of a new air routes to Nabire Airport.
What few jobs exist typically go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papuans rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested to stay in the village ... because there's no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the world's eyes off Papua.
In addition, reporting restrictions for international media remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for a "lack of coordination with related institutions" despite having been granted rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's election campaign pledges to lift reporting restrictions to boost transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new hazards for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia's restive easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of press scrutiny means international pressure on the Indonesian government has been largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - urged the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These same countries have historically backed the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Arrmanatha Nasir shrugged off the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta, "In Indonesia, a democratic system still applies and there's free media so it's hard for the evidence of human rights cases to be covered up."
Local people want more foreign governments to take note.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the nation's human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people broke their silence, beseeching, "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but who asked to stay anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote again for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, the tribal council chairman.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, aside from living under the looming threat of a rapacious military, wallow in destitution, with paltry education and health services.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, consider their vote to Jokowi as a "debt" he must repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: burying one victim's body on land just opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice may never be served, at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family has been killed," says Yacobus, head bowed.
"What else could we do?"
Reviewing "On Sense and Reference"
Laying-out of the Sign-Sense-Reference frame
Frege is an enthusiastic formalist who had been pursuing an ideal language capable of expressing thoughts in an exact manner.
His work On Sense and Reference is also based on this pursuit.
Frege introduced the distinction between sense and reference as a solution to the puzzle of the inaccountability of the difference between a=a and a=b (given that a=b is true).
The equality itself is put forward as a puzzle: what is equality about?
Is it about relation and if so, is the relation between objects or between signs?
By trying to answer this question, Frege came to the discussion of the sense and reference of proper names and laid out his framework of how signs, sense and reference work together to shape a system of meaning at the logic level.
This framework of connexion has been defined as: to the sign there corresponds a definite sense and to that sense in turn a definite reference which is cited as the famous semantic triangle in later literature.
This is a great clarification of the opaque world of meaning.
Actually many great linguists at that time did not realize this distinction and made confusing remarks in their discussion of meaning.
For example, Bloomfield, being deeply influenced by Behaviorism, kept confusing reference and sense in his discussion of meaning in Language.
In Bloomfiled's world, a meaning of a word is exactly its reference without the intermediate node of sense.
Because his ignorance of the distinction between sense and reference, Bloomfield made many wrong comments in his work of Language.
Frege does not offer an academically formal definition to sense and reference for it is just hard to define them.
We can only find an informal definition throughout the paper:
It is natural to think of there being connected with a sign, besides that to which the signs refers, which may be called the reference of the sign, also what I should like to call the sense of the sign, wherein the mode of presentation is contained.
As this review will point out later, this inclarification is responsible for the problems discussed in the reference of sentences.
Under the category of reference, Frege distinguishes indirect reference and customary reference.
Under the category of sense, he distinguishes indirect sense and customary sense.
Frege bridges reference and sense by advancing that indirect reference of a word is its customary sense.
This distinction, while its correctness and necessity remain open to debate, is crucial in his discussion of reference of sentences.
Frege made a claim at the very beginning of the paper Equality is a relation between names of objects.
In the discussion of proper names, he argued against the relation being about objects by pointing out it does not hold true if the two names do not both have designated things.
He also pointed out if equality is about relation between what the names designate, it would be that a=b could not differ from a=a (provided a=b is true) as we already mentioned in the outset.
One thing we should notice is that for reference of words, Frege mainly talked about nouns and did not extend to the discussion of verbs or adjectives.
Shall we follow Frege's question for the reference of sentence and ask what is the reference of verbs and adjectives?
Or put it more specifically: do they have reference?
It seems Frege skips this question which, in our view, is kind of strange given his strong concern for reference of nouns and sentences.

French Navy captures a huge supply of cocaine heading to Australia.
The French Navy seized a yacht in the Pacific carrying 1.46 tonnes of cocaine, worth about $256 million.
The consignment was headed to Australia.
The four-man crew was arrested during the siege, and was apparently formed of Lithuanian and Latvian people.
The yacht, which was named Afalina, sailed from South America and the police dragged it to a port in Nouméa, a metropolis in the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian intelligence service said it would work with its international partners to determine exactly where the drugs were going to and from, and to unmask the "Lithuanian syndicate".
"We are grateful to the French authorities for taking measures that have stopped a large number of drugs targeting Australia," said managing director Col Blanch.
The drugs were destroyed in Nouméa this week.
Australia is an attractive target for smugglers because of the high street prices of drug.

Seniors don't feel thirst and need to be reminded to drink.
The problem can be found in seniors' homes, and according to Pavla Mádlová, a physician from the Geriatric Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague, the solution could be an infusion of a physiological solution under the skin with a thin needle.
However, at present this approach is only applied in health care facilities.
The older a person is, the more the amount of water in their body decreases.
"And they also lose their sense of thirst, so seniors generally drink less fluids and become dehydrated very quickly," said Mádlová.
They should definitely drink two litres.
"But getting so much fluid into an old person is a big problem," she added.
She thinks that doctors often don't monitor this in care homes for seniors.
In hospitals, dehydration is commonly treated with infusions.
"I think subcutaneous infusions should be gradually introduced there too," she said.
In her opinion, older people can be given a two-litre bottle of physiological saline in one day.
A lack of fluids can cause malnutrition, headaches and decreased performance.
Dehydration manifests itself as a complete loss of self-sufficiency.

Fire engulfs Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper for second time
A fire ripped through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of occupants to flee the 337 metre-tall, 79-storey structure.
It's the second blaze to sweep through the high-rise - which happens to be called the Torch tower - in just two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no immediate word on the cause of the blaze.
"We were sleeping and we woke up to the fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to reach from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defence authorities said firefighting squads put out the blaze at around 4.00 am local time (0000 GMT) and were cooling the building.
The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected.
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used on the exteriors of tall buildings across the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch after its 2015 fire found that most of the damage was to the cladding, exterior panelling used for decoration or insulation.
In the UK, police have said they believe the system of insulation and cladding panels on London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire there in June in which some 80 people died.

The Modern State: Imagined or Real?
The bureaucracy is the imaginary state alongside the real state-the spiritualism of the state (Marx, 1978a:24)
Is the modern nation-state real or imagined?
To answer this conundrum, there have been countless debates on the nature of the State among social scientists.
We can categorize these arguments into two competing schools of thought:
Marxian notion of the instrumental state and Weberian theory of the state-centered approach.
Which theory correctly captures on the nature of the State?
If instrumental, how can we understand people's nationalistic sentiment firmly grounded in a territorial and social space of the nation-state?
If real, how can we explain impersonal, reified citizenry and its abstractedness? Rethinking Marx and Weber, I will argue that there is no contradiction between them, although each had a different emphasis.
Thus I treat them not as mutually exclusive but as two sides of the same coin.
Marx(ian): the nominal State
In The Communist Manifesto, Marx and Engels assert that The executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.
This famous definition on the State has been generally represented as the instrumental State in canonical Marxism, anchored in so-called economic determinism.
Instead of using the conventional term instrument, my suggestion is to use a new term the nominal State in order for us not to fall into the trap of economic reductionism.
By describing characteristics of the modern, nominal State, we then discover its hollowness and thus its reified nature.
Sayer (1991) illuminates this nominal aspect of the State so my argument below relies largely on his explanation.
Marx's original work emphasize the nominal aspect of the State in that it is an illusory representation of capitalist society and what Sayer called an ideological project (Sayer, 1991: 83).
The modern liberal State consists of its subject, the citizen, and therefore it is a truism to say that if it is a mere collective mis representation then a characteristic of citizen is also essentially mis representation.
Sayer argues that Marx focuses on the abstraction of the individual as the basis for civic citizenship and observes that this citizenship has never extended to all individuals who live within civil societies (1991: 84).
Thus, according to Marx, a citizen is an abstract individual who can be equated with the bourgeoisie: the commodity exchanger in civil society.
Here double processes of abstracting, reifying civil society and the State, conjoin.
That is the reason why Marx criticizes the Hegelian argument- the Family superceded equals Civil Society, Civil Society superceded equals the State, the State superceded equals World History and departs from the Berlin Young Hegelian circle (1964:185).
For Marx, the State is not a supercedence of civil society but another abstraction from civil society abstracted from the family.
Likewise modern world history, the history of inter-state relations, is not a cumulative process of dialectical transcendence from the Family but a consequence of triple abstractions from it.
Yet each abstraction has its own façade and we should distinguish among specific abstractions.
The subject in civil society and the State is, in principle, not identical but two sides of the same coin.
More precisely, the historical process of modern state-making through what Marx called political emancipation is a reduction of man, on the one hand to a member of civil society, an independent and egoistic individual, and on the other hand, to a citizen, to a moral person (Marx, 1978b: 46: italics original).
So the fundamental premises of the human-being in both domains are exactly opposite: one, in the civil society, is selfish, whereas the other, in the State, is moral.
Effect of Anxiety to Citizens: Does Anxiety Facilitate or Deteriorate Citizens' Motivation and Capacity to Political Information and Activity?
Introduction
The purpose of the paper is to examine the effect of anxiety over information seeking of the people.
Recently, many of political psychology works focus on the effect of anxiety to citizen's democratic competency, especially to their leaning capability of political affairs.
However, some studies over the effect of anxiety find seemingly contradicting effect of anxiety to the voter's information seeking and learning.
Based on Affective Intelligence Theory (AIT) proposed by Marcus and his colleagues, some authors argue that anxiety shift attention of the people to novel stimuli, and consequently lead them to seek more information and learn about political phenomena that otherwise outside of their everyday life.
However, the other groups of scholars suspect the implication of AIT because anxiety is basically emotional response of avoidance from the threatening stimuli.
Both of the groups presented supportive evidence to their theoretical hypothesis.
Why do they observe these contradicting results?
In this short paper, I would like to propose the need to contextualize the effect of anxiety.
To say more specially, I argue that the effect of emotional responses perceived as anxiety are contingent of the other factors, certainty of threat from the stimuli on the one hand, and perceived competence of the people to deal with the threats on the other hand.
In the next section I begin this article with the brief description of the discussion between the groups of the political psychologists advocating and criticizing the Affective Intelligence Theory by Marcus and his colleagues, and try to figure out how they reached to contradicting results.
Their discussion offers the important starting point to develop the theory of the effect of emotion over information behavior further.
Affective Intelligence Theory and Its Critiques
In the last decade, many political psychologists have worked on the relationships between citizens' emotional status and their democratic capability.
Marcus, Neuman and MacKuen published Affective Intelligence and Political Judgment in 2000 and the book has quickly become a focus of discussion.
In the book they propose Affective Intelligence Theory (AIT) that people usually reside in the dispositional system at which they can concentrate on their current tasks and let other things to their predisposition.
However, if they perceive the novel and threatening stimuli, then a different brain system, the surveillance system is evoked.
The surveillance system raises a cognitive function and drives people to examine their environment as to whether it is safe or not.
If the system finds something abnormal it refrains from ongoing tasks and allows people to shift their attention to the threat.
Anxiety is the emotional signal transmitted from the surveillance system that indicates now is the time to look for a solution to the new and threatening circumstance.
Therefore, a functioning surveillance system, observed as heightened anxiety, facilitates people to seek information and learn rather than when they feel an enthusiasm, the emotional indicator of working of the dispositional system at which people focus on ongoing works and leave other works to their habits.
Applied in a political context, Marcus and his colleagues found that anxious citizens relied less on partisan cues but more so on their policy preferences and candidates' qualities in their vote decision.
Many works follow AIT and have found supportive results.
First, Brader (2005) finds that cueing fear in political advertisements stimulates citizens' attentiveness, and hence increases their reliance on contemporary evaluation.
Consequently, this increases their propensity to be persuaded by factors other than party identification.
On the other hand, the author also finds that enthusiastic cues in political advertisements can motivate people to participate and activate their existing partisan loyalty.
Crigler, Just and Belt (2006) obtained similar results with that of Brader.
Crigler et al found that anger, worry and fear about a candidate stimulate respondents to pay greater attention to the campaign media, although positive feelings about candidates stimulate campaign involvement (pp.154).
Their work found that positive aspects of enthusiasm can facilitate a citizen's political participation.

Topics in Political Philosophy
Rawls gives priority to the principle of equality of opportunity over the difference principle for income and wealth.
This requires that people with equal innate endowments have equal chances to attain positions of power and responsibility, along with the higher income attached to those positions.
To realize this principle might require that the state invest very heavily in the education of the economically disadvantaged, so that the talented among them have an equal chance to rise to higher positions.
The taxes required to sustain that investment may well reduce the income prospects of the least talented under the difference principle (they will not directly profit from the money spent on educating the more talented to a higher standard).
1.
Do the least talented have a just complaint against the most economically disadvantaged talented people, that the money spent on the latter's education in order to give them an equal chance to rise above the minimum position comes at the expense of those destined to occupy the least-well paid positions?
2.
How should one reason about this question from the perspective of the original position, and from the perspective of citizens in democratic societies?
We complain when we deem ourselves disadvantaged, and when we deem this disadvantage wrong.
The untalented poor may consider themselves, as a matter of fact, to be at a disadvantage under a theory of justice that gives lexicographical priority to fair equality of opportunity (FEO) over the difference principle (DP), and they may think, as a matter of justification, that this ought not to be the case.
I shall assume that, as a matter of fact, the lexicographical priority does disadvantage the poor untalented, and I shall enquire what, if any, justification can be made for this disadvantage.
I shall assume then that the lexicographical priority of FEO over the DP causes disadvantage to the untalented poor in one of two ways: either they enjoy less investment in their education than they would have enjoyed in the absence of the lexicographical priority, or they enjoy less income and wealth than they would otherwise have enjoyed.
I take it that if a justification cannot be found for the disadvantage suffered by the untalented poor thanks to the lexicographical priority, then the untalented poor have a just complaint against the talented poor that benefit from that priority.
The justice of the lexicographical priority of FEO over the DP might be grounded in one of three hierarchies: first, in a hierarchy of contingencies that are a morally irrelevant basis for the distribution of social primary goods; second, in a hierarchy of social primary goods necessary for the exercise of the two moral powers in the two fundamental cases; or, third, in a hierarchy of paradigms of justice, i.e. of the relational over distributive justice.
I shall reject the first two accounts, and show that the third is promising.
However, I shall raise separate problems for the third account.
Thus, I shall conclude that the untalented poor have a just complaint if the third account is unable to deal with the problems I raise for it.
One might try to justify the lexicographical priority of FEO over the DP by grounding it in a hierarchy of contingencies that are a morally irrelevant basis for the distribution of social primary goods.
This assumes that the two principles differ in the effect of which morally irrelevant contingencies each is supposed to regulate.
The thesis would be that eliminating social inequalities (i.e. those arising from family and class privilege) is infinitely more important than counteracting natural inequalities (i.e. those arising from differences in ability and ambition).
More than 1 in 5 US travellers carry prohibited items onto aircraft, survey finds
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 per cent had knowingly or unknowingly smuggled prohibited items past the US Transportation Security Administration checkpoints onto the aircraft, including at least 6 per cent who boarded the plane while unintentionally carrying prohibited knives or other bladed objects.
Less than 1 per cent claimed that they discovered belatedly that they had mistakenly travelled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1000 people - which was conducted by a jet-chartering service Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travellers were more likely to flout the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 per cent were millennials, compared with less than 15 per cent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items whisked past TSA agents on purpose were food and liquids.
More than 3 per cent admitted knowingly carrying bladed items past security, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also acknowledged intentionally carrying prohibited drugs onto the aircraft.
The company said it surveyed travellers around the country to find out how many had accidentally brought contraband through airport security and how many had done so on purpose.
It's no surprise that the people most likely to haul contraband past security - knowingly or unknowingly - were those who fly the most.
As the company points out, however, the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain of what liquids they can carry or how much of them.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of stuff seized by the TSA happens to be forbidden liquids.
For a time, people thought the TSA might be treating books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international ones.
EPA Chief Pruitt Backtracks on Delaying Obama-Era Rules to Reduce Emissions
One day after getting sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era rules reducing emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency being more responsive than past administrations to the needs of state environmental regulators.
He made no mention of the legal challenge filed against his prior position in a federal appeals court.
At issue is an Oct. 1 deadline for states to begin meeting 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June he would delay compliance by one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering with local decisions or impeding economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's state attorney general prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long served as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil-fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled the EPA administrator overstepped his authority in trying to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested his about-face on ozone standards simply reinforced the EPA's commitment to working with states through the complex process of meeting the new standards on time.
"Under previous administrations, EPA would often fail to meet designation deadlines, and then wait to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing in a settlement to set schedules for designation," said Pruitt, who sued EPA more than a dozen times in his prior job.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the statute and the authority it gives us seriously."
Still, the EPA's statement said Pruitt may at some point once again use his "delay authority and all other authority legally available" to ensure regulations "are founded on sound policy and the best available information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone rules.
A House bill approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been brought to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to keep up the legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal - following our lawsuits - is an important win for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers, and the over 115 million Americans directly impacted by smog pouring into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York was joined in the case by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Ground-level ozone is created when common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems among sensitive groups of people, contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It's disturbing how much pressure it took to get this commonsense step from the guy in charge of protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We've got to keep fighting the Trump administration's ideological crusade to pander to polluters and special interests."
A man carries out an acid attack but the court declares him not dangerous.
You never know what can happen to you.
One moment, you're at home laughing with your family, and the next your whole life is shaken to the core.
And the worst thing is that you can't do anything about it at all.
This is the fate that met Andreas Christopheros from Great Britain, whose face was burned with acid by an unknown attacker who was eventually acquitted.
Reuters reported on the story.
In December 2014, someone at knocked on the Christopheros' door.
Andreas got up to open it.
He thought that the person at the door was probably the courier who was supposed to deliver the Christmas gifts for the family that day.
Instead, a terrible surprise awaited him.
A man he had never seen in his life poured acid on him without warning as soon as he opened up, saying, "That's for you, friend."
The pain was indescribable.
My clothes dissolved into nothing, and I just felt an unreal pain on my skin," said Andreas.
His family quickly took him to the hospital, but his relatives learned terrible news there - the doctors said he had no chance to survive.
Several weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly worried that their patient would succumb to the infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injuries were very serious.
Ninety percent of his face was affected, and the doctors attempted to piece it back together with skin from other parts of the patient's body.
One major complication for Christopheros was the loss of his eyelids.
Without doubt, it's the most painful thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't escape from unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he said, describing his suffering.
At this point, Christopheros has undergone twelve operations and is still far away from the last.
According to plastic surgeons, injuries affecting sufferers of acid attacks can require hundreds of surgical interventions and years of healing.
Even after demanding, long-term treatment, the victims still have scar tissue for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people do not recover, and they fight deformity and disfigurement throughout their lives," said Peter Dziewulski, a spokesperson for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker made a mistake.
In terms of the attack, Christopheros is convinced that the unknown man must have confused him with someone else.
The perpetrator believed that he was taking revenge on a man who had sexually abused someone close to him.
The police investigated the case thoroughly and finally tracked down the assailant.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, the verdict was later fundamentally altered, much to the astonishment of Christopher's family.
"Three judges eventually concluded that the sentence should be abolished because the man was not considered to be a threat to the public," said Christopheros.

They are demanding that the UK Government enforce stricter and longer prison sentences for people attacking their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They are also calling for tighter controls on the sale of dangerous substances, which are often commonly available in many shops since they consist of various cleaning products.
The Difficulty With International Law During the War on Terror
The Bush administration's war on terror has had a significant impact on the international community.
This world-wide conflict has pushed the limits of international law and questioned its value.
The lack of an agreement on the meaning of the word terrorism is a major reason why problems arise when fighting this global problem.
The American Heritage Dictionary defines terrorism as the unlawful use or threatened use of force or violence by a person or an organized group against people or property with the intention of intimidating or coercing societies or governments, often for ideological or political reasons.
But many questions arise from this definition.
For example, how does one differentiate acts of terrorism from acts of war?
Why does terrorism occur?
Can terrorism ever be acceptable?
The vagueness of the word terrorism and other such language in international law lead to different interpretations and therefore disagreement on a standard rule.
Many authors have attempted to shed light on this matter by offering their insights on policies of fighting terrorism.
Authors Abraham Sofaer and Kenneth Roth highlight the ambiguity of language in international law during the fight against terrorism which leads to the need for international laws and treaties to be revised in order to keep up with the current status quo.
Abraham Sofaer begins his piece, Terrorism and the Law, by discussing different means that a state can utilize while dealing with terrorism.
There are diplomatic means and military means, but he focuses on the use of law.
This is due to the fact that Americans are particularly attracted to the law as a means for repressing violence, and are committed domestically and internationally to using law to control criminal conduct and to resolve disputes
Although using the law is successful when dealing with domestic crime, problems arise when dealing with international terrorism mainly because the world has no international police force or judicial system.
The lack of international cooperation is an even greater dilemma.
Terrorism's association to negativity and evil is embedded in the minds of the majority of Americans.
But in reality, the acceptance of terror is far more widespread around the world as many nations regard terrorism as a legitimate means of warfare.
Acts of terror may often be justified when they are attributed to injustice and frustration.
Sofaer highlights a series of seven United Nations General Assembly resolutions on terrorism and its causes that were passed during the seventies and eighties to illustrate the inability of the international community to settle on a clear meaning of terrorism.
There are attempts among radical groups that are responsible for terrorist acts to seek legitimacy by securing a legal status for terrorism that obscures its fundamentally criminal nature.
The extent to which the rules of the Geneva Convention should be applied was heavily debated.
Further disagreement was seen regarding treaties among states that obligate them to extradite to other states persons accused of committing, in those states, the crimes associated with terrorism.
The political offense claim is often used as a defense against extradition.
The UN Convention Against the Taking of Hostages also redefines some aspects of terrorism to include them under the rules applying to combatants.

In Dubai, the biggest city in the United Arab Emirates, one of the tallest residential buildings in the world, the famous Torch skyscraper, caught fire during the night.

At that time, Lucie was only 19 years old, and she definitely did not want put the brakes on her career.
They separated back then, but remain friends to this day.
They proved this at a press conference at TV Prima, where they met after a long time.
By coincidence, they both matched with blue colours.
At first they ignored each other, but then they got closer, and Lucie laughed at Michal's jokes, to the point where she ended up clutching her belly.
Then they hugged and willingly posed for the photographers.
Their encounter was not a coincidence, however, as they will play a loving couple in the new Prima series Kapitán Exner.
Assembly Tolerance Analysis for BBM
1.0 Define
Better Body Manufacturing (BBM) is a supplier of module body subassemblies to an Automotive Manufacturer.
Recently, they have asked our team to perform a Six Sigma analysis to insure that their major part, the body side subassembly, is achieving Six Sigma quality levels of less than 3.4 defects per million for all critical body side subassembly dimensions.
A subassembly consists of a body side assembly (BS), and two reinforcement pillar bars (A and B).
BBM has asked us to reduce assembly defects by either adjusting a process setting, reducing the stamping variation, or reworking the stamping dies.
BBM management would like our team to recommend an improvement strategy that minimizes the rework costs, yet achieves the desired quality objective.
2.0 Measure
To approach this problem in a meaningful way, we used a top-down analysis method to come up with our recommendations.
Top-down analysis suggests that you start with the assembly data and identify those assembly dimensions that are not meeting BBM's goal of 3.4 DPM.
After the assemblies are identified, proceed to analyze only those assemblies by looking at the assembly process and at the stamping process.
A visualization of the important manufacturing processes is shown in Figure 2.1.
Figure 2.1: Relationship of Stamped Components and Assembly Outputs
Our statistical analyses of the 10 subassembly processes are shown in Table 2.1.
Due to the large amount of data, we chose not to provide charts for each of the subassemblies but instead summarized our work.
A process capability analysis provided data for the DPM for each process, as well as the process capability indices (Cp, Cpk, Pp, Ppk).
All data followed a normal distribution.
All measurements data are taken from gages that meet Gage R&amp;R standards.
Table 2.1: Statistical Summary Table for 10 Subassemblies
As shown in Table 2.1, subassemblies 1, 2, 4, and 5 do not have quality issues.
Our team, therefore, focused on subassemblies 3, 9, and 10 which had mean problems (mean shift or mean off-target) and subassemblies 6, 7, and 8 which had mean problems and high variation problems (spike or common cause).
Stated earlier, the goal of our work is to achieve 3.4 DPM or less for all 10 of the subassembly processes.
3.0 Analyze
A top down analysis was conducted in which assembly defects are investigated before component defects.
In order to determine whether the out-of-specification assembly measurements were caused by assembly process or by incoming component defects, the correlation between the predicted stacked component measurement and the actual assembly measurement was investigated.
It is assumed that if the predicted stacked component measurement is highly correlated with the actual assembly measurement, then the defects are due the incoming components; if there is little or no correlation, there is an assembly process problem.
Table 3.1 shows the values for R generated from the correlation test.
Table3.1 Correlation between Predicted Stacked Components and Actual Assembly
Location 7 and 8 are the only two locations that have defective incoming components (R&gt; .7).
Locations 3, 6, 9, and 10 have assembly process problems.
Assembly Defects
First, the causes of defects were investigated for each location supposedly exhibiting assembly defects.
An additional 24 observations were made.
Three process inputs were examined using DOE - Clamp Location, Weld Density, and Pressure.
For location 3, none of the factors were found to be significant using DOE.
From the run chart (Figure 3.1), it is observed that location 3 does have a mean deviation problem (observed mean of 0.8).
Figure 3.1 Process Capability SixPack for Location 3
However, there was no correlation observed between the predicted stacked component measurements and the actual assembly measurements.

Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
38.3°C was recorded in Hodonín.
Tuesday's record temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius only stayed in the top spot for two days.
When 38.3 degrees Celsius was recorded in Strážnice, Hodonín, Thursday surpassed the previous peak, making it the hottest day this year.
This was confirmed by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
Elsewhere, however, many of the temperature records set on Tuesday did not fall on Thursday.
On Tuesday, records were beaten or matched in 35 of the 145 meteorological stations, which have been measuring the weather for over 30 years.
Only nine long-term measuring stations saw new record temperatures set on Thursday.
For example, in Strážnice the temperature during the day on Thurday was the same as the previous record set in 2013.
In Lednice, near Břeclav, the temperature on Thursday reached 37.4 degrees, surpassing the original maximum by four tenths of a degree, and in Pohořelice near Brno the current temperature of 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records was last broken in 2013, like in Strážnice.
In the west, it was about 10 degrees less.
The high temperatures on Thursday mainly occurred in the south and east of Moravia.
After Straznice, the biggest heat was in Dyjakovice, near Znojmo, and Brod nad Dyje, near Břeclav, where the mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not beat the record.
On the other hand, according to the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute (ČHMÚ), on Thursday the highest temperatures in western and northwest Bohemia were only about 22 degrees Celsius.
"Temperatures started growing there later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
According to the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute (ČHMÚ), the current heat in the Czech Republic will fade erode and there could be heavy rain on Sunday.
However, temperatures in Moravia will mostly remain high on Friday, and also on Saturday in the southeast of Moravia.
China is lacking tourists.
Beijing is losing billions because of the national visa policies.
For decades, China has been trying to exert its influence without the use of force.
It spends 10 billion dollars a year to support language schools and establish universities abroad, pushing its entertainment industry towards foreign markets and trying to attract Western tourists.
It isn't doing anything for Beijing, however.
The local state media has been talking about a plan to make tourism a driving force for economic transformation and modernisation.
However, the number of visitors grew by only 3.8 percent last year, and about 80 percent China's tourists came from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
Among other things, this is due to the fact that, despite all its global aspirations, the Chinese Foreign Minister does not welcome foreigners with open arms. At least this is how Christopher Balding, Professor of Economics at Beijing University, assessed the situation in the most populous country of the world in an article for Bloomberg.
One particularly indicative example is the Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free entry to China, while the citizens of the others have to organise visas in advance.
As such, the Chinese offices in the US have crowds comparable to the Chinese New Year celebrations.
The visa costs 140 dollars, but if you do not want to wait in the queue for hours, you have to pay 100 dollars or more for additional services.
These kinds of restrictions create significant economic barriers.
A study by the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for visas reduces the visitor numbers by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while 1.8 million Americans went to Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China's gross domestic product and is home to less than one percent of its population.

Dressed in the more traditional black suit and black leather pumps, I am doing a last minute check in the basement bathroom mirror before I walk up to the Pierpont Duderstat connector on north campus, already crammed with engineering students, waiting patiently inline along the walls to talk to the recruiters.
A good candidate knows the importance of keeping composure and presenting themselves even when no one is watching.
The recruiters at the engineering career fair are flown in from all over the United States, hired by more than two hundred companies ranging from small consulting firms to big corporations, to recruit the best of the best, namely Michigan graduates.
The competition is still fierce, especially between students of the same major.
My friends constantly show their frustration by telling me that they can’t believe the guy sitting quietly besides them in their engineering course interviewed for the same company as them and got an offer while they were turned down.
Although that being the downside of career fair, it has always been interesting going to class on the day of, and seeing everyone dressed in their best outfit, mostly new clothes since we are used to jeans and Michigan sweatshirts.
Even the guy with funky T-shirt of a baby head had changed into a conservative white dress shirt and a pair of black pants over black shoes.
Never ever wear white socks with black shoes and black pants, because they are like flashlights that turn on and off when you are walking.
A career center advisor once warned us during a workshop called Making a Good Impression.
To stop all the female audience from nudging their male friends and snickering, the advisor said:
Ladies, you don’t want to wear too much jewelry.
Stick to the basic: no dangling earrings, over-sized necklaces and definitely no rings unless you are engaged or married.
I say this not only because it’s very distracting for the recruiters, but also because once I had a girl who wore some really spiky rings on her right hand.
Unfortunately she was a bone crasher when it comes to hand shake, and she actually injured the recruiter while shaking hands.
I head some grunts and laughs, but also saw some people taking notes religiously.
As far as I know, job hunting becomes an obsession as we approach senior year.
Even the computer science geek who used to hide in computer labs and program all night long is now eager to talk to Google and Microsoft representatives.
Never chew gum.
It makes you produce too much saliva, and you may accidentally spit on the recruiter.
Classroom Study, Part 1
Background Information about the Classroom
The class I will desribe is a Latin One class which takes place during fourth hour—right before lunch.
There are thirty two students in the class representing all four grade levels.
On any given day, as is expected, there are two people missing for one reason or another.
The teacher is the one who is soley responsible for the materials and preparation for the class, so the students view him as the ultimate authority over the material and the physical space.
The classroom has desks in rows facing forwards towards the white board.
The teacher's desk in in the center of the front of the room, and in the wall opposite the door has several windows.
Around the middle and back of the room are various posters and descriptions of Roman buildings.
Towards the front, the pictures are more of a literature-based theme.
There is a small alcove with amusing comic strips pertinent to Latin or literature.
There are also large, movable white boards which are in different places every day depending on their use.
The colors are fairly muted, so the room has a calm feeling which seems to me to be pretty conducive to learning.
The class has five Asian students of whom three are Korean and two Chinese; four are English language learners.
One of the Korean girls has such trouble that she often uses an electronic dictionary.
One student came from Ukraine three years ago but already has excellent English skills.
Another boy has some sort of accent, but it is unclear where he is from.
There is an Armenian girl whose English skills are perfect, but she references her heritage and is visibly proud of it.
Two students in the class are African-American, and one is of some kind of mixed race.
One boy is Indian and he has a slight accent, but I am unsure as to when he started learning English since he speaks quite perfectly.
One student has a mild learning disability which involves having trouble getting words out sometimes; he recieves extra time for tests.
The students all feel pretty much at ease with each other, and if there is free time of some kind, almost everyone has someone to talk to and they slide easily in and out of conversations.
Usually, while an assignment is being handed back or checked at the beginning of class, it is acceptable to chat quietly, but then everyone goes silent when the lesson starts.
It is expected that everyone is quiet and paying full attention, and the teacher always reminds students to raise their hands if they want to say anything.
The lessons are entire-class efforts—they revolve around people participating one-by-one and helping each other out, so the sense of community is well-developed and there is a feeling of good intentions.
Culturally Responsive Pedagoy
My teacher is very passionate about teaching Latin to students and strongly believes that they are all capable of understanding and enjoying it.
Part of what contributes to this feeling for him is that, since the subject has a reputation for being difficult, the students are all volunteers and are motivated to learn.
He believes that the students have a great deal of intelligence and skills in other areas, which he often draws upon in class.
He frequently relates class to running somehow to appeal to the many girls on the track team, and tries to engage one of the quieter boys with references to bass-guitar, which they both play.

Trump pressured Mexico on border wall payment according to leaked phone call transcripts
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been leaked by the Washington Post.
On 27th January in a phone call to Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a proposed border wall.
The US President berated him for publicly denouncing the wall, reportedly saying to him "You cannot say that to the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the US southern border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published revealing a tense exchange.
Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull a deal for the US to take on refugees headed for Australia was "ridiculous," "rotten" and "stupid," insisting the deal, brokered under the Obama administration, would make him look like "a dope" after he had proposed a ban on refugee resettlement in the US.
Mr Trump ended the call after telling Mr Turnbull "this is the most unpleasant call all day."
A Model to Test the Effectiveness of Standardized Nursing Terminologies In Electronic Medical Records
Introduction
There has been an increased interest in research to determine the effectiveness of patient care.
Kane (2004) suggests that the reason for this is due to several factors.
Patients are increasingly demanding accountability from health care providers for what happens to patients (p. ix).
The increased use of quality improvement techniques borrowed from industry is also contributing to the trend for outcomes research.
Industry leaders who are footing the bill for health care want to see the health care delivery system apply the same techniques that they are using to respond to customers' demands for quality and value.
White (2004) points out that outcomes information can bridge the gap between interventions and what is actually accomplished for patients.
The implementation of electronic health records is seen as a method for improving communication between health care providers in the care of individual patients, and as a means of aggregating information about the effectiveness of interventions applied to groups of patients (Currell and Urquhart, 2005a).
The United States government has mandated the development of electronic health records in this country.
However, there is little evidence that has been presented to demonstrate how effective the use of electronic health records might be.
This would seem to be an area that is ripe for research related to the effectiveness of electronic health records, the content of those records, and cost-effectiveness analysis to determine the return on investments in costly technology.
Patients undergoing surgical procedures are an appropriate group in which to conduct outcomes research.
According to the Surgical Care Improvement Project, there are 30 million surgical procedures performed annually in the United States (SCIP Partnership, 2004).
The group estimates that a significant percentage of these procedures will result in preventable complications.
This paper will propose a model to evaluate the effectiveness of standardized nursing terminologies in electronic medical records in decreasing the occurrence of these errors and improving patient outcomes by improving communication between caregivers.
A Proposed Model
Kane (2004) emphasizes the importance of a conceptual model in designing research studies that evaluate intervention effectiveness and outcomes.
This step is critical to identifying both the outcomes of interest and the treatment or intervention that is believed to influence those outcomes.
Outcomes are a function of the baseline, the clinical characteristics of patients, the demographic and psychosocial characteristics of patients, the treatment or intervention, and the setting in which care is delivered.
Each of these components for the proposed model is outlined below.
Characteristics of Patients
For the purposes of this model, the patient population is defined rather broadly.
In terms of demographic characteristics, the patients will be adults.
While certainly pediatric patients could be at risk for post-operative complications, there is less evidence to specify which complications may be most prevalent in children.
Also, caring for children demands the involvement and care of their parent/guardian, which adds a component of communication that may not be present to the same degree when caring for adults.
Clinically, only patients scheduled for elective procedures will be examined in this model.
Non-elective or emergent surgery by its definition sometimes lacks the detailed advanced planning that goes into preparing for a planned surgical procedure.
While the risk of post-operative complications is no less real for patients undergoing emergency procedures, communication patterns in that instance might differ from those utilized for scheduled patients.
Controlling for age and nature of procedures are two methods of leveling the playing field, or adjusting for risk (Kane, 2004).
Risk adjustment is a method of correcting for differences in the composition of patient groups that are being cared for by different groups of providers or settings, and is a necessary step in designing a study that can apply across providers and/or settings.
The recurrent cholera pandemics have been related with environmental variability and spatial heterogeneity.
However, no spatially explicit model has been developed in order to consider such variations.
The first step towards a spatially explicit model for cholera consists of the identification of the influence of processes and patterns at different spatial scales: micro (local), meso (intermediate) and macro (regional) scales.
Analysis applying Point Pattern Analysis, Geostatistical and Epidemiological techniques are proposed in this work to perform such spatial characterization on cholera mortality data from the last 23 years in Matlab, Bangladesh.
Introduction
The world is still suffering the effects of the seventh cholera pandemic since 1961.
This current pandemic originated in Indonesia with the first instance of an epidemic form of the strain known as El Tor, while the former six pandemics of cholera have been attributed to the Classical biotype (See Table 1).
Hence, the challenge for epidemiologist nowadays is to have an epidemic-anticipatory-capability for the appearance of new strains and the reemergence and/or rapid geographic expansion of old strains.
Because one of the most important goals of epidemiology is to avoid the occurrence of pandemics, revealing the processes leading the occurrence of outbreaks is critical.
The recurrent epidemics of cholera present peculiar characteristics involving:
– a strong association with climate (Rodó et al., 2002; Pascual et al., 2000;
Colwell, 1996),
– different strains, which potentially may displace each other or even exhibit cycles between them (Simanjuntak et al., 2001),
– a temporary immunity, which only recently has been estimated (Koelle and Pascual, 2004),
– and a world wide presence, with cases reported in Nigeria, Chad, Cameron and Senegal at the end of 2004 (WHO, 2005), aside from the abominable epidemics in Peru during 1991-2, the endemic presence in the Indian subcontinent, and a potential eighth pandemics in Indonesia (Simanjuntak et al., 2001).
Unfortunately, in spite of the advances in cholera research, a full characterization of its dynamics still remains distant.
Epidemiology of Cholera
During the first cholera pandemic in 1817, the spread of cholera was believed to take place throughout the miasma (fog) coming from the rivers, showing some initial empirical findings in relation with water (Sack et al., 2004).
Only in 1854, John Snow showed that contaminated water was the cause of cholera, and finally, during the epidemics in 1884 the causal agent was identified: the bacterium Vibrio cholerae (Colwell, 1996).
Cholera is characterized by producing a profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting, circulatory collapse and shock (CDC, 2005).
Such symptoms are usually manifested in a period ranging between 18 hours and 5 days of incubation, potentially in conjunction with an important liquid loss that may be close to one liter per hour (Sack et al., 2004).
The treatment, basically, consists of a rehydration therapy, which may be complemented with appropriated antibiotic assistance, depending on whether complications occur.
Cholera is considered a water-borne disease, although the bacterium may also be transmitted by contaminated food or a mixing of both, during (improper) cooking.
Secondary infections (for example, during unhygienic funeral practices) rarely occur, and therefore, the pattern of water use is responsible for the dynamics of the epidemics (Sack et al., 2004).
The causes for contamination of water sources are, however, not so clear.
On the one hand, considering human beings as reservoirs positive feedback from infected individuals to water sources, introducing or maintaining the levels of cholera, may play a major role, leading to a strong correlation between patterns of mortality and human aggregation.
On the other hand, if the bacterium life cycle is mainly controlled by environmental conditions, there might be a correlation with environmental variables or variability (Pascual et al., 2002; Rodó et al., 2002;
Pascual et al., 2000).
The Role of Township and Village Enterprises Play on Income Inequality in Rural China Research
Transition economy is an important research object in economic sociology.
What’s more interesting and significant in this topic are the economic reforms carried out or being carried out in the developing countries, which involve widely and profoundly with the fundamental issues in society, such as social inequality and modernization.
China, which has a population of more than 1.3 billion, also, which has experienced rapid and enormous economic development, is facing the intense social inequality between its urban and rural sectors, as well as between its coastal and inland regions.
Even within the rural sector itself, income stratification has been forming along with the Chinese economic reforms.
Township and Village Enterprises (TVEs) are playing crucial roles in the income inequality in rural China due to their special position within the rural labor market, and between the agricultural work and employment in cities.
This research proposal requests one year of funding to support the collection and analysis of data that will illuminate the effects TVEs have upon the income inequality in rural China, especially during the Chinese reform-eras.
The following narrative of the proposal has three sections.
The first section introduces TVEs’ influence and significance in a context of Chinese social transition and relevant studies on Chinese economic reforms and inequality.
The second section will provide the models to predict the income inequality between three groups within the rural residents: those who remain in agricultural work, those who work in TVEs, and those who work in cities; the models will lead to three parts of analyses: which group earn the most?
Whether the inequality changes through time (before vs. after reforms)?
Whether the inequality differentiates regionally?
The third section will provide the space for some sociological reflexion on two aspects: compared to the living costs of those rural residents, will the conclusion on the between-group inequality still hold?
To what extent are those TVEs marketized?
TVEs' Influence and Significance in a Historical and Academic Context
China has experienced high-speed growth already for about three decades, to which China’s success in its economic reforms is widely known.
From the agrarian reform in 1978, to the market reform and openness reform in early 1980s, to the industrial reform of state-owned enterprises (SOE) in 1994, China has been situated in an intense economic transition from the Maoist era.
Between 1978 and 1993, the share of SOE employment was down from 75% to less than 60% in the urban areas and from 60% to about 30% with the inclusion of non-farm employment in the rural areas.
During the same period, the state share of industrial output declined from 78% to 43% (Cao, Qian and Weingast, 1999).
Where should we put the TVEs within this context of economic transition and reforms?
The Chinese government defines TVEs as those run by Chinese peasants (Li and Fang, 1997).
More specifically, TVEs are referring to those enterprises either collectively established by or initially based on and closely associated with rural communities such as townships and villages.
(Perotti, Sun and Zou, 1998)
In this sense, they are typically collectively owned by the citizens in rural communities such as townships and villages (Perotti, Sun and Zou, 1998).
So although they are also public enterprises, they are conceptually different from SOEs.
From both the above description of the reform process in China, and the definition of TVEs, we could notice that so far, there is actually not any carefully designed policy or plan (Perotti, Sun and Zou, 1998) exclusively for TVEs.
1978 reform was for agricultural privatization, and 1980 reform was to open up to the outside world.

Tusk testifies at the prosecutor's office again regarding Smolensk.
"He should be afraid," announced brother of the dead president and leader of the Law and Justice party Jaroslaw Kaczynski at Tusk's address.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczynski doesn't intimidate me," responded Tusk, reproaching the country's current leaders for trying to pervert justice to attack his political rivals.
As he left the headquarters of the Prosecutor's Office, according to television channel TVN 4 a crowd was waiting for Donald Tusk and chanting his name. They also wished the politician good health.
Tusk thanked them for their support and assured them his conscience was clear: "I have nothing to fear, Kaczynski doesn't intimidate me."
According to the prosecutors he isn't accused of anything, but there is no doubt that justice system is being used to serve the current Polish rulers as a tool against its adversaries, opposition or people who do not like it, and I am afraid I belong to this group.

In addition, there was discussion on bodies being changed in the coffins.

The reason was that they were afraid of scandal that would put pressure on Polish-Russian relations.
"Maintaining good relations at all costs, in spite of such a terrible event, should have served to make Donald Tusk very important in the EU," said Kaczyński to the Catholic television channel Trwam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia could have affected Tusk's chances of reaching the most important seat in the Union, which Poland absolutely does not have.
Kaczynski also stated that he warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that it might turn out differently with Donald Tusk, but she didn't pay attention to it.
Tusk endured an eight-hour examination at the Prosecutor's Office on 19 April.
He didn't testified as a suspect, however, only as a witness.
However, many people considered his summons to be part of the apparent effort of the Polish government and Law and Justice leader Kaczynski to discredit Tusk as a political rival by linking him with various scandals.
In Poland the prosecutor's office is subordinate to the Minister of Justice, who acts as the Prosecutor General.
The call for questioning came shortly after Tuska was elected the President of the European Council, which Kaczynski tried to prevent in vain, including during Merkel's visit in Warsaw.
Only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydło protested the prolongation of Tusk's mandate at the EU summit.
In that instance Hungarian premiere Viktor Orban also left Warsaw stranded.
Goffman and Butler: two complementary approaches for understanding a queer social interaction
Consider the following social interaction.
Participant One:
Hey!
You big queer!
Participant Two:
Yes, I am queer.
What is it to you?
What are the cultural meanings being deployed in this interaction?
What are the social constructs being upheld?
How are the two related?
By way of answering these questions, let's consider how Judith Butler and Erving Goffman would approach them.
For Butler the interaction described above is an instance of the affirmative resignification of the term queer by the person whom it aims to degrade; her analysis is primarily cultural and focuses on the sets of meanings being exchanged by the participants.
For Goffman this is an example of face-work in which Participant Two is saving face by denying the threatening nature of the first participant's remark;
Goffman focuses on the social processes of the interaction.
Through these two perspectives we will examine the processes at work in the interaction above.
In turn, this examination will illuminate the notions of the cultural and social in Goffman and Butler's works, as well as, how they interact to produce cultural and social change.
Goffman
In his essay On Face-Work Goffman focuses on the structure and processes of social interactions.
The organizing element in a social interaction is the line that each participant takes on; that is the pattern of verbal and nonverbal acts by which he expresses his view of the situation and through this evaluation of the participants, especially himself (5).
Related to the concept of a line, is the idea of face, which is the positive social value a person effectively claims for himself (5).
As a social interaction unfolds, participants attempt to maintain their face by adopting a particular line; this is called face-work.
In our example, Participant One adopts a line of hostility toward the other participant by putting forth unfavorable information about her.
Through this hostile remark Participant One aims to assert his own favorable, or normative, status relative to Participant Two, thus staking out a particular face.
Participant Two adopts a self-confident line with Participant One by ignoring the threatening meaning of the term queer and claiming it as a positive or neutral evaluation, thus saving face.
In order to understand the above interaction an observer must be familiar with the meanings exchanged by the participants.
Both parties use the term queer, however, it has vastly different meanings in each usage.
In the first statement queer is intended to convey scorn, while in the retort the term is embraced, and thus neutralized, by the speaker.
Goffman acknowledges the necessity of understanding the manipulation of meanings in social interactions.

Where in the world can Czechs vote?
During the parliamentary elections this autumn, registered voters will once again be able to vote on the composition of the Chamber of Deputies from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
The Czech Republic has opened up its embassies in these and several other countries since the last parliamentary elections held in 2013.
This move is intended to fulfil a decree regulating the delivery of ballot papers abroad.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has updated it, and is currently in the process of sending out reminders.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens voted abroad.
"Since the last amendment to the Decree in 2013, there have been some changes that have to be taken into account in these lists," the ministry explained.
"New embassies have been established in some countries, while certain offices have been closed or the levels of representation have changed," according to the text.
The decree contains two annexes, the first of which states the embassies that will be supplied with ballot papers.
This group of offices includes the representation of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, namely Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than one hundred Czech authorities will receive a ballot sheet to be printed.
The list of which ones is changing with the decree, however.
Four years ago, Czechs could vote at the Czech Embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.

Before each election, the state electoral committee determines which regions' candidates can be voted for abroad by ballot.
The first time was in 2002, when it was decided among the South Moravian candidates.
In the next two elections, the Czechs voting abroad could also select South Bohemian candidates.
In 2013, the Central Bohemian Region was included as well.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
Some 3800 people voted the first time 15 years ago, then about 6700 in 2006 and 8222 four years later.
The previous parliamentary elections four years ago saw 10,571 voters come to the embassies.

This tragic context raises the need to inquire into the phenomenon of societal conquest - imperialism on the move, at large.
Here, I will attempt to modestly (and in much truncated form) take a step towards addressing this effort by examining (and critiquing) Karl Marx's perspectives on imperialism.
I have chosen to examine Marx's thoughts on imperialism because his writings on the subject are instructive to us in two key ways.
First, Marx demonstrates how imperialism came about as a system of global domination and the way in which it effects subjugated societies.
And second, Marx unwittingly shows, through his writings on British rule in India, how arguments for imperialism as a means for emancipation are invariably flawed.
Marx and imperialism
Marx himself never uses the term imperialism, but implies the concept in many of his writings.
Therefore, the majority of theorists of imperialism claim to be furthering his ideas (Wolfe 1997: 389).
Marx indicates that overseas expansion - the development of the world market and the conquest of cheap sources of raw materials - is a natural outgrowth of capitalism, of competition between the bourgeoisie:
The need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe.
It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connexions everywhere (Marx and Engels 1967: 83).
Marx writes that bourgeois wealth in the more advanced capitalist countries of Europe, was accumulated through the plunder of the peoples of the New World, the profits of plantations based on slave labor, the looting of the colonies' treasures:
The discovery of gold and silver in America, the extirpation, enslavement and entombment in mines of the aboriginal population, the beginning of the conquest and looting of the East Indies, the turning of Africa into a warren for the commercial hunting of black skins, signalised the rosy dawn of the era of capitalist production (Marx and Engels 1978: 435).
Capitalism shows its true colors in the conquered societies, he says:
The profound hypocrisy and inherent barbarism of bourgeois civilization lies unveiled before our eyes, moving from its home, where it assumes respectable form, to the colonies, where it goes naked.
(Marx and Engels 1978: 663)
Marx points out that the bourgeoisie use imperialism to stave off a proletariat revolution:
The veiled slavery of the wage-workers in Europe needed, for its pedestal, slavery pure and simple in the New World (Marx and Engels 1978).
According to Marx, imperialism allows the levy of the most grotesque costs of capitalism on conquered societies, therefore allowing the bourgeoisie to lessen the burdens on the proletariat of their own societies.
He reiterates this point in a letter to Engels dated 1858, suggesting that through imperialism the bourgeoisie could defeat a proletariat revolution at home:
The specific task of bourgeois society is the establishment of a world market, at least in outline, and of production based upon this world market.
As the world is round, this seems to have been completed by the colonization of California and Australia and the opening of China and Japan.
The difficult question for us is this: on the Continent the revolution is imminent and will immediately assume a socialist character.
Is it not bound to be crushed in this little corner, considering that in a far greater territory the movement of bourgeois society is still in the ascendant? (Marx and Engels 1978: 341)
It is in the light of the foregoing that Marx interprets the effects of British imperial rule on Ireland.
First, Marx argues that Ireland's poverty and misery was caused by English oppression and exploitation.
The following piece serves as a good example:
Every time Ireland was about to develop industrially, she was crushed and reconverted into a purely agricultural land…The people had now before them the choice between the occupation of land at any rent, or starvation (Marx and Engels 1978:132).

Biological Significance of Modular Structures in Protein Networks
RODUCTION
It is widely assumed that cellular functions are organized in a highly hierarchical and modular mannar (Hartwell, Hopfield et al. 1999).
Each module is a discrete object composed of a group of tightly linked components and performs an independent task, seperable from the function of other modules (Hartwell, Hopfield et al. 1999; Ravasz, Somera et al. 2002).
With the advent of genome scale data, many efforts have been devoted into identifying modular structures and their biological significance (Barabasi and Oltvai 2004).
To thoroughly study the modular structure(Ravasz, Somera et al. 2002; Rives and Galliski 2003;
Yook, Oltvai et al. 2004) of large scale networks require effective and automatic method that can separate modules.
Clustering could be one of the methods to discover module structure in networks using topological structure (Ravasz, Somera et al. 2002; Giot 2003; Yook, Oltvai et al. 2004).
And some studies combined clustering with functional genomics data also gave good result (Stiart, Segal et al. 2003; Tornow and Mewes 2003).
By using RNA expression profile data, Han etc. (Han, Bertin et al. 2004) divided the hubs into data hub and party hub and showed modularity organization in yeast protein-protein interaction networks.
Fraser (Fraser 2005) studied the evolutionary conservation of data hubs and party hubs and suggested the occurring of modules through exon shuffling.
However, the module separation by clustering usually gives ambiguity result (Barabasi and Oltvai 2004), part of which is because of the network's hierarchical structure.
But lack of objective judgment could be another reason.
Newman (Newman and Girvan 2004) proposed a method to measure the modularity of the separated modular structure and devised a greedy method to separate module according to edge betweenness (Newman 2004).
Based on the modularity definition, many other algorithms were invented to get the global maximized modularity because greedy methods could be easily trapped in local maximization (Duch and Arenas 2005; Guimera and Amaral 2005; Massen and Doye 2005).
Heuristic algorithms often give better result, especially for the networks with relatively low hierarchical structure.
Using stimulated annealing to maximizing the network's modularity, Guimera and Amaral (Guimera and Amaral 2005) was able to identify the functional organization of metabolic networks.
According to the topological properties, functional roles were determined for each node and they showed the evolutionary conservation among different roles of nodes.
Nevertheless, their result that intra-module hubs are less conserved than the intermodule nodes, which contradicts with Fraser's (Fraser 2005) result for protein networks that intramodule hubs are more conserved.
In this paper, modules are separated solely based on the topology of protein networks.
The biological significance of modular structures is accessed by functional and evolutionary data.
The modular structures show highly evolutionary conservation when comparing the orthologous proteins in yeast and fly modules.
Modular structures in protein networks
The modules of protein-protein interaction networks of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiare and fly Drosophila melanogaster was identified using simulation annealing algorithm.
For the protein networks, the largest component contains 3862 nodes (about 94% out of 4216 nodes for the entire network) forming 7208 edges for yeast and 6279 nodes (95% of all) forming 10094 edges.
The overall modularity is 0.666 for yeast and 0.685 for fly suggestting a high modular organization of the network (table 1).
A Critique of A Test of Leadership: Charting the Future of U.S. Higher Education
As higher education enters a period of tremendous growth and change, it is more important than ever to have a national understanding of the mission, goals and accomplishments of the many institutions we support, and the academy in its entirety.
Without achieving this before adjustments are made, American higher education will fall victim to much scrutiny and criticism, and our nation will be divided on one of our most important and prized possessions.
Fortunately, we have highly educated leaders at the helm of our institutions in America as well as effective national leadership focused on the United States education system as a whole.
Their combined knowledge, experience and understanding of this nation's system of higher education is unique and immeasurable, resulting in a powerful team to guide academe during periods of insecurity.
One group, the Commission on the Future of Higher Education, has such members.
In a charge led by the Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings, this commission set out to evaluate the current state of higher education and recommend higher education reform in an effort to secure our position as a world leader in education.
Their conclusion is clear, change is necessary and it's needed now.
The report outlines the challenges that higher education will likely face in the coming decades and offers recommendations to secure our position in an increasingly globally aware society.
However, despite the commission's efforts to perform a comprehensive critique, it repeatedly fell short, repeatedly lacking both scope and focus.
From the beginning, A Test of Leadership: Charting the Future of U.S. Higher Education lacks the ability to define the broad goals of American postsecondary education, for both the academy and their students.
In a broad generalization, the Commission's report calls for a national approach to higher education, where all colleges and universities find themselves on a level playing field, and where they strive to prepare students for the workplace skills that employers are seeking.
In their eyes, institutions will adopt new missions and will become flexible enough to accommodate the many populations of students that seek postsecondary education.
Likewise, students will have the freedom to move between these indistinguishable institutions through general education classes and flexible credit transferring, leading to more accountable practices and measurable outcomes by evaluating student gains via national exams.
The commission believes the future of American higher education lies with the ability to reduce costs while still maintaining quality practices and developing relationships within the academy and across the secondary-postsecondary threshold.
The commission calls on higher education administrators to make these changes, not national educational reform.
The result is a crumbling foundation on which the commission continued to build their critique upon.
What is Learning?
Perhaps the most troubling is the Commission's inability to construct appropriate goals for higher education, including a definition of learning and how that learning is approached.
Rather than focusing on the means, the report's focus becomes the end, of which employer approved seems to be prominent.
Much like institution types have become indistinguishable, so too have skills and knowledge.
The report calls for student outcomes to include workplace skills to accomplish tasks rather than placing an emphasis on critical thinking, interdisciplinary knowledge and the ability to solve a variety of problems.
To many institutions, the contemporary goal of higher education has been to prepare students to be lifetime consumers and producers of knowledge rather than to simply teach skills.
Barr and Tagg (1995) recognize that higher education has reconfigured their understanding of their institutional goals, moving from the belief that college provides instruction to a more modern view that it is an institution that produces learning.
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Reenact Racist Lynching as a Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury passed through a group of onlookers in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled toward the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped forward to block its path.
The leader of the mob - a middle aged man in a pinstriped suit - took a long drag on his cigar and peered through the windshield.
Inside, the occupants reeled in fear.
"We want that n----r Roger!" the man barked.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams ripped through the silence as a young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat.
Fortunately, this horrific scene, which played out on July 22, is just a reenactment.
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger," nearly everyone in the audience let out very real gasps.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to recreate the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It's mind boggling that all of these years, not a single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities; even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reenactment.
"It's a stain on a history, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want closure, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but we have to have justice first," he said.
"We can't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A coroner places a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore's Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching.
But not one was ever prosecuted.
Though the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say the twin motivations for the lynchings were always well known throughout town: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling enabled black citizens in Georgia to cast ballots for the first time during the primary race later that summer.
Around the same time of the election, according to the FBI, black sharecropper Roger Malcom stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, during a fight - ostensibly over a woman.
Brooks said the town rumor was that Hester had been sleeping with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not her husband's.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to bail Malcom out of jail, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to the prison by Dorothy, and their cousins, Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But, driving away from the jail, as they approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out it was Harrison who set up and ordered the murders," one FBI report concludes.
"It is also apparent that there was a conspiracy among state and local law enforcement, who not only took part in the murders, disposed of evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks put it more succinctly.
"It was a voting rights massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you register and if you vote, this is what will happen to you.'"
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has directed the annual reenactment of the Moore's Ford Bridge lynchings.
Her performance is graphic, gripping and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It's difficult to watch, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynching because it makes us face the ugliness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you, if you won't hear me, or hear what I've been through."
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched into a well-rehearsed overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's co-director.
He's played the part of the head Klansman for years, but he said the role never gets any easier.
"I feel dirty because this is not who I am," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to keep this history alive because we don't want to go back to those times."
Across the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcom shouting and shoving Hester, livid that he's been sleeping with his wife, Dorothy.
"I said n---a, get off my property!"
Rascona fires back.
There's a beat.
And then everyone (at least all the black actors) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs the hardest.
"What?!," Rascona asked.
He's alarmed, confused.
Did I go too hard?
"No," Greene said through chuckles.
"I just don't think white people back then said 'n---a.'"
"Yea," one of the other black cast members quipped.
"You have to hit the hard 'R.'"
And just like that the energy in the room shifts; a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is dedicated to getting this right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, it's sharp and emphatic.
Absolutely no one laughs.
The reenactment ends violently and quickly.
There's screams, gunfire and then, silence.
A woman dressed in funeral black, stands over the actors bodies and performs Billie Holiday's mournful eulogy, "Strange Fruit."
Her voice breaks on every other word.
A hundred yards back, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears away from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly split between black and white.
One couple has traveled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many are from just down the road.
They've all weathered Georgia's oppressive humidity for the nearly eight hours as Brooks lead them on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the lynchings took place, the air feels haunted.
As the final notes of the song fade, Greene invites the crowd to move closer and inspect the bodies.
Children crouch by their heads, take in the fake blood and still bodies, and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," one little boy mutters, as if to remind himself.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd, and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw off the lynching rope and wipe away tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the head Klansman.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his castmates, and then breaks down crying in their arms; the emotional toll of the performance finally getting to him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know that's not what's in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta chats animatedly about the reenactment with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words for how the performance made her feel.
"It's hard to hear those horrible awful words, and deeds ... come out of people that look like you and who do it because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me is make me think that lynchings are still going on," she added, "they're just called police shootings now."
Across the room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, eating and reminiscing about civil rights.
He said he's already begun planning for next year's performance.
"The reenactment is inspirational in a way because it describes the horror of what we endured, but it also is a teaching moment," he said.
"It's like, if you don't learn from this, it can happen again.
Those who don't study their history, those who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it."
The Central Message of Chaucer’s Retraction
The length and the abstractness of Chaucer’s Retraction can be deceiving and misleading, it can potentially lead readers to believe that the Chaucer’s retraction is trivial and insignificant.
The strong religious references may even deter the reader from exploring further.
And because the text is disconnected and isolated from other tales and other parts of The Canterbury Tale, people can even treat it like the unfinished Cook’s Tale.
One of the most vital messages of The Canterbury Tales is hidden in Chaucer’s Retraction : Since Geoffrey Chaucer possess the awareness and honesty like the Pardoner, he has the guts to confess his sins.
And his intention is not to just confess his sin or ask for his own forgiveness, but he hints that the readers should also ask for the mercy of God to forgive their sins.
The identity of speaker, Chaucer, is central to the meaning of the retraction.
In this passage of Chaucer’s Retraction, And if ther be any thyng that displea-se hem, I preye hem also that they arrette it to the defaute of myn unknnynge and nat to my wyl (1082-1083, Chaucer’s Retraction).
Chaucer asserts that anything that offends the reader should be imputed to his lack of ability and not to his will.
Here, it is the second time that Chaucer has made the similar type of claim in The Canterbury Tales.
In Chaucer’s Tale of Sir Topas, the Host interrupts Chaucer’s tedious tale by saying Namoore of this, for Goddes dignittee,/ for thou makest me/So weryof thy verray lewednesse (906, Sir Thopas).
Chaucer responds with Why so?
Why wiltow lette me. / Moore of my tale than another man/ Syn that it is the beste tale I kan (926-928, Sir Thopas).
Chaucer claims that he has told the story the best of his ability, the beste tale I kan.
Ironically, no one in the history of the literature would doubt Chaucer’s ability to compose poetry with complex ideas.
The readers are fully aware that Chaucer has the ability to tell a magnificent and profound tale.
Is Chaucer lying? What is important to point out is that we must distinguish the author Chaucer and the character Chaucer in the poem.
They are completely different people: the author, Geoffrey Chaucer is unquestionably one of the greatest English author and poet of all time.
He is the first author to finish his masterpiece in the vernacular English language.
The reason why we are still reading Chaucer’s text today is because the greatness and the inherited values and ideas embedded in this rich text.
On the other hand, the character Chaucer in the book is a completely different character.
He is a story teller, and he tells the worst tales among all pilgrims.
In The Tale of Sir Topas, each stanza is intentionally filled up with clichés and absurdities.
This is a symbolic move on Geoffrey Chaucer’s part.
The character Chaucer is a representation of writers, especially the writers who do not have the skill to compose fresh rhymes or innovative thoughts, who continue to write clichés and conventional expressions.
Those writers are precisely who Geoffrey Chaucer criticizes and makes fun of because there is no profound literal value or an attempt to solve social problems.
In contrast, Geoffrey Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales is precisely the opposite: the tales resembles an entire society, high and low, male and female, old and young, Christian or pagan, educated or ignorant, town and country.
They are certainly amusing tales to read on the surface, but the political implication and social satire under the surface are why The Canterbury Tales stands out from all other books.
The author Geoffrey Chaucer mocks the character Chaucer and his conventional writing.

Theories and concepts do not exist in a vacuum.
Rather, they grow out of a historical context that both nourishes while constrains their development.
In the process of development, these concepts and theories dialogue and interact with (perhaps agree, disagree, or complement) other components in the context.
As Magraret Somers suggests, concept is produced, organized, constrained, and contained by its embeddedness in a conceptual network, which is a structured relation matrix of theoretical principles and conceptual assumptions.
(Somers 1995, p.134) Keeping Somers’ idea in mind, I will attempt to locate several concepts of Polanyi, Adrent, and Harbermas in a conceptual network of utilitarian and liberal social thoughts.
Conceptual network: phantasms of Leviathan, Locke’s dichotomy between public and private, and social naturalism
While Polanyi, Adrent, and Harbermas composed their thoughts in the twentieth centuries, we still can see their interaction with the 17th century specters of Hobbes’
Leviathan and of Locke’s civil society and social naturalism in their theories.
To solve the problem of order, Hobbes creates a powerful Leviathan, but Leviathan per se becomes a source of coercion.
Locke then succeeds to address threats of Leviathan/absolutism/tyranny by devising a civil society -- a private sphere distinct from and independent of the state.
In order to ensure individual freedom and property in this private realm, Locke adroitly arranges the temporal sequence of the occurrence of these two spheres.
In his narrative, civil society, the prepolitical community, emerges first.
Through the formation of a social contract by individuals in the civil society, state--a representative government-- is established and gains its legitimacy.
In addition to this dexterous arrangement in temporal order, Somers suggests that Locke creates a super powerful metanarrative by grafting his narrative to the binary epistemological coding of social naturalism.
In this combination of narrative and binary codes, the private realm, the civil society, wins its epistemological privilege over the public realm--the state, because the former falls on the natural side in the epistemological divide while the latter falls on the non-natural side(Somers 1999, p.145).
In this way, the sole place of social organization in Hobbes’ narrative, the state, is split into two parts—state/the public realm and civil society/the private realm (Somers 1999, p. 122).
Meanwhile, because of its naturalness, the private realm/civil society has sustained its superior position to the public realm/state, as well as its heroic reputation of establishing the social foundations for individual freedom and autonomy against the coercions of the state(Somers 1999, p.137).
The great dichotomy of modern political thought was born (Somers 1999, p.122).
Afterwards, this dichotomy has become a shadow in which subsequent political and social thoughts have been built.
To facilitate relating the concepts of Polanyi, Adrendt, and Harbermas to this conceptual network, it is helpful to take a closer look at Locke’s private realm/civil society in advance.
Distinct from Marx’s narrow notion of civil society that is merely associated with market, Locke’s civil society is a more comprehensive concept that refers to a plethora of institutions outside the state (Alexander 2006, p.24).
It is true that Locke locates the sphere of commerce, property, and exchange in the private sphere, yet according to Locke’s arrangement, it is the political culture of public opinion and social trust that ensure order, freedom and moral cohesion outside the institutions of the state (Somers 1999, p.143).
As Alexander emphasizes, this notion of civil society is endowed with a distinctively moral and ethical force (Alexander 2006, p.25).
As I will mention later, the notion of civil society would be narrowed down to an economic realm or even to the market by subsequent thinkers.
Karl Polanyi’s concept of the discovery of society
Polanyi fundamentally diverges from the utilitarian and liberal tradition.
His object in The Great Transformation is critique of economic liberalism.
Distinct from utilitarian and liberal tradition’s dividing the society into two realms: state and anti-state, Polanyi takes a holistic view on the society.
As Somers points out, the foundational concept of Polanyi’s theories is the idea of totality-- a social whole that provides the necessary context for grasping particular social dynamics.
Repression and the emergence of the bourgeois self: the social origins of neuroses
The self - a concept with which we are well acquainted today - refers to the construction of an individual consciousness in relationship to itself, other individuals, and society.
It is a concept built on Enlightenment ideas of the individual as a person possessing reason and free will.
It was the child of thinkers like Rousseau, Hobbes and Hegel who focused their philosophical investigations on the individual.
Once the individual was created as a subject in the consciousness of everyday life, the self arose in modern discourse.
The construction of the self is a rule-governed process in which certain development is encouraged, while other qualities are curtailed.
In Five Lectures on Psycho-Analysis Freud outlines repression as a means by which the self is shaped, in the sense that certain ideas are repressed, or removed, from consciousness.
Frantz Fanon builds on Freud's theory in Black Skin, White Masks to describe the construction of the self within the social structures erected by colonialism.
Freud and Fanon focus on neuroses as symptoms of the development of the self gone awry as a means by which to study the process of development itself.
Fanon and Freud agree that the rules governing this process are derived from society.
However, while Freud only tangentially discusses the role civilization plays in the psychological development of the self, Fanon goes so far as to claim that the self is socially constructed.
Since the rules governing this process are formulated in society, then the emergence of the bourgeois self refers to the construction of the self in a particular - bourgeois - society.
In this paper I will discuss construction of the self and the role that society plays in this process as presented by Freud and Fanon.
I will first outline Freud's theory of repression and discuss how repression shapes the self.
I will then examine the role that Freud attributed to society, specifically bourgeois society, in this process.
I will then draw out how Fanon used Freud's theory of repression to argue that development of the self is socially constructed.
Freud
Freud developed the theory of psychoanalysis in the interest of treating patients with hysterical, or neurotic, symptoms.
He initially postulated with Breuer that these symptoms were the result of previously experienced traumas.
However, he later redefined his theory to propose that neuroses are the result of conflicting impulses within the self.
When an intolerable impulse arises a struggle ensues, with the objectionable wish on one side and the individual's ethical and aesthetic standards on the other (22).
A complex arises as the internal struggle ends with the repression of the undesirable wish, which is pushed out of consciousness into the unconscious.
At first it appears that the struggle has been resolved.
However, the unsatisfied wish still lurks in the unconscious waiting to resurface.
It later makes its re-entry into the conscious realm, disguised in another, often harmful, form.
Thus Freud traces the appearance of neuroses to the repression of certain ideas and wishes that are in conflict with what is deemed acceptable by the self.
Freud does offer other mechanisms, in addition to repression, for resolving this conflict.
Language, Literacy, and Policyin the Philippine Context
It is said that language is the faculty that is most uniquely human.
So much of our selves and our identities are tied to the language we speak; the way we see and understand the world is strongly shaped by it.
Perhaps this is the reason why issues of language are often so contentious.
This is especially so in states that are not nation-states; that is, countries that are made up of more than one ethno-linguistic group.
In such states, language is often pressed into service as a means to unite people, as a basis for their imagined community (Anderson, 1991).
The selection of one language for that purpose, however, means that some other language is not selected, and so the source of strife.
Some states have adopted the solution of allowing for more than one language in the polity, a situation where one maintains allegiance to the larger entity, while also retaining affiliation with one’s own smaller group.
Keeping such in balance, however, is not always easy; where one ends and the other begins is not always clear.
Such ambiguities become apparent in institutions and domains where language must be used and where literacy is a must, such as government, education, and commerce.
The last introduces a further complication.
In a globalized world, there is no way to escape doing commerce with other nations, and such commerce must necessarily be done in the global lingua franca, which happens to be English.
As such, in some states, there are not just two, but three or more languages in the mix.
The Philippines is one such state.
An estimated 160 languages are spoken throughout the country.
Of these, seven languages have more than one million speakers, and two of these – Tagalog and Cebuano – have more than ten million native speakers each (World Bank, 1995).
And there is a strong regionalism that often falls along these linguistic lines.
Indeed, while weather is the standard topic for strangers in other parts of the world, Filipinos who meet for the first time, especially when overseas, ask each other what region or province they come from, which answer becomes the basis for their conversation.
This regionalism might have to do with the country being a developing nation where three-fourths of the population lives near or below the poverty threshold (National Statistics Office, 2003).
It has been noted that in hard times, people will cling to their language and ethnic group; in times of plenty, they pay little attention to resources like ethnic languages (Paulston, 1988, p.7).
Language can determine opportunity, and opportunity is crucial for those who depend on it for survival.
This sociolinguistic situation presents challenges for Philippine education and public policy.
On the one hand, the educational system needs to deal with the diversity of languages in which that education will be delivered and in which literacy skills must be developed.
On the other hand, it must do this while working with limited financial resources.
This scarcity of resources dictates that education be delivered efficiently and effectively, according to what is known about language and learning.
As such, there are several questions that research and policy need to answer, and which this paper will discuss.

Frederick Winslow Taylor was born into an affluent upper class liberal family in the state of Philadelphia on March 20, 1865.
His father Franklin Taylor, was a lawyer by profession but made enough money from mortgages and did not have to keep a regular job.
His mother, Emily Winslow, was a dynamic lady and is said to have run an underground railroad station for runaway slaves.
Both parents were staunch followers of Quakerism and believed in high thinking and plain living.
Parental authority was supreme in the house and none of the three children of the family, Edward, Frederick and Mary could question their parents.
In this atmosphere, Frederick developed into a young man with a lot of self-control.
Fred was a person given to lofty thinking by nature and was eternally engaged in solving practical problems faced by him and his friends.
He was by no means an average person and wanted to improve things continuously.
An example of his innovativeness right from childhood is his analyzing and attempting to find a solution to his own problem of having nightmares, which he observed he'd been having when sleeping on his back.
After a stay of two years with his family in many countries across Europe, during which he learnt a lot about the countries in addition to their languages, Frederick went to school in Exeter, New Hampshire.
His competitive spirit made him study in dim light to make up for his poor memory and the eye problems that he developed consequently forced him to discontinue his education.
After some therapy at home, Fred seized upon an opportunity to learn through an apprenticeship at a small Philadelphia pump manufacturing company, the trades of a pattern-maker and machinist.
His openness about learning is demonstrated in a statement from his diary:
The very best training I had was in the early days of apprenticeship…when under a workman…I learned appreciation, respect and admiration for the everyday working mechanic.
Having learnt certain tricks of the trade over a period of four years, Frederick joined the Midvale Steel Company.
In his early times of employment as an apprentice, machinist etc., Fred gave more importance to learning and hence went up the ladder quicker than an ordinary worker while taking nominal wages, and living with help from his father.
He phenomenally rose from the rank of a shop-clerk to that of a Research Director, and thereby Chief Engineer in a short span of six years.
It is here that he came up with many of his ideas based on systematic observation and subsequent analysis.
Also, he picked up a Mechanical Engineering degree at the Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey while holding a full-time job at the age of twenty-five years, a record yet to be broken.
Frederick Taylor's analysis of metal cutting, especially with single-point cutting tools, which was done at Midvale, is considered one of the pioneering works in the field.
Theory of Scientific Management and other contributions

I would now add that the largest problem of the entire case is that Jim did not use the resources available to him to the best of his ability.
Jim did speak frequently with Paul, a fellow teacher, and enlist the help of Mrs. Rush, a floating aide, for as long as she was available.
However, Jim should have put forth much more effort toward finding someone to help Carlos improve his phonics and spelling scores.
Although this case study does mention that Jim asked the principal why Carlos was placed in the 3-A class, it does not state anywhere that Jim specifically talked with either the principal or assistant principal (if there was one in his school) about the difficulties he was encountering with Carlos.
Both of these people would have most likely been able to offer an ample amount of suggestions.
Generally, principals are highly qualified people who have a vast amount of knowledge about problems that arise in schools.
It is possible that Jim's principal may have even dealt with a similar occurrence and was successful at making the situation better for everyone involved.
In addition, I believe that the principal would have appreciated knowing what was currently happening in Jim's classroom.
In Social Class Difference in Family-School Relationships: The Importance of Cultural Capital, Annette Lareau describes middle and working class culture.
On page eighty two, Laurette says, Middle-class culture provides parents with more information about schooling and promotes social ties among parents in the school community.
This furthers the interdependence between home and school.
Working-class culture, on the other hand, emphasizes kinship and promotes independence between the spheres of family life and schooling.
It is evident from the information Jim divulges about Carlos's parents that he believes them to come from working-class culture.
It is unfortunate that Jim makes assumptions such as these because he does not have enough information to do so.
Making assumptions about Carlos's parents further negates the situation as well as makes conversation between Carlos's parents and Jim more difficult than necessary.
Another possibility could have been for Jim to speak with someone in the faculty of his school or community who was a fluent speaker of Spanish.
He could have used this person as a resource to help facilitate communication between Carlos' parents and himself in a conference.
Alternatively, Jim could have also tried to get in touch with Carlos's sister.
Regardless of which family members Jim was able to come in contact with, a conference would have allowed Jim the opportunity to voice his concerns about Carlos's progress in spelling and phonics.
In retrospect, I believe I overlooked how large a problem it was that Jim did not use the aforementioned resources to his advantage.
Which problems are within Jim's control?
Why? Which are outside of his control?
Why?
It is important to remember that while some of the problems that arise in this case are within Jim's control, others are not.
I initially answered that Jim is able to control amount of allies he has in the school, which I view to be very few.
I also said that Carlos' reading group is a factor that Jim can control.
I would now add that he can also control his attitude.
Jim's attitude is a feature of this case that only he has the power to manage.
APPLYING ERIKSON'S IDENTITY THEORY: A CRITIQUE OF MARCIA AND A PROPOSIAL FOR AN ALTERNATIVE MODEL
Identity is a central topic in personality psychology.
After all, how can we study personality without studying what it means to be a particular person?
Social identities are essential to studying the person and can consist of gender, racial, ethnic, cultural, sexual, and ego identities, among many others.
Most models of identity formation are based on, or at least influenced by, Erikson's psychosocial theory of identity development.
Erikson is generally considered the founder of identity theory, and his writings are the framework for several classic and contemporary models.
One of the most applied of these is Marcia's four status model of ego identity.
Marcia's model has become one of the standards of identity development and variations of the model have been used to measure and explain many types of social identities.
However, I do not believe that this model is the most accurate interpretation of Erikson's theory of identity.
Drawing on Erikson's theory of psychosocial development, along with various other identity models and empirical studies, I propose an alternative framework that I believe can better explain both Erikson's theory, as well as some of the empirical evidence from recent research.
ERIKSON'S PSYCHOSOCIAL THEORY OF DEVELOPMENT
Identity is the focus of Erikson's fifth stage of psychosocial development theory (1968).
According to the theory, identity issues come to the forefront during an individual's adolescent years.
During this time, young people go through an identity crisis—a process of developing their ego identity while struggling with identity confusion.
According to Erikson (1982), identity develops through a process of interaction between the individual and the community.
Identity development means nothing without considering the social contexts because identity is developed in relation to society.
Society identifies, labels and stereotypes individuals according to the social process of the time (21).
The individual reacts to this identification by accepting or rejecting these labels.
In turn, the community reacts to the decisions made by the individual and re-identifies the individual accordingly and the process continues.
For example, consider a youth who lives in a conservative suburban neighborhood.
She may choose to react against this identity by dying her hair blue and getting tattoos.
Society in turn re-labels the youth as a rebel ; this new label in turn will effect how the youth views her identity.
It is clear that this developmental interaction between individual and society heavily depends on the historical and social contexts.
For instance, dying one's hair blue is a very different statement and would cause very different societal reactions depending on whether one lives in a small southern town in the 1950s or in San Francisco in 2007.
The drive to test alternative, often extreme, identities and rebel against societal standards is called role repudiation.
This may include diffidence —a hesitation to develop an identity; defiance against society and identity development; and/or negative identity —affirming socially unacceptable identity aspects (Erikson 1982).
This rebellion is articulated as being the antithesis of a committed, mature identity, and if maintained, may lead to a regression to earlier developmental stages.
However, he also argues that identity formation is impossible to establish without going through this process of being able to distinguish what may be incorporated into one's identity from what should be protested as alien to the self (Erikson 1988).
The result of the successful completion of this stage of development is ego identity.
Ego identity is the formation of a unified and stabile personality that can be recognized by the self as well as others as being characteristic of that person (Erikson 1982).
Ego identity is achieved by identity exploration and determining which aspects of one's identity is to be kept and which aspects are to be discarded.
This period of experimentation is called moratorium, during which individuals may take time to test out their identity before committing to them.
Search for SUSY signatures in the Dilepton Channel at CDF
Abstract
One of the best channels for direct Supersymmetry searches is the dilepton channel (two high-pT leptons + 6ET).
Many of the present limits for SUSY have been set at Run I of CDF.
Run II will present further opportunities for either discovery of SUSY particles or setting better limits.
Presented here are outlines of some of the more promising signatures in this channel: stop quark decay into dileptons and chargino/neutralino decay into dileptons.
Also presented is a model that may help explain a softness in lepton pT in the top dilepton sample at Run II of CDF using SUSY.
1 Introduction
Supersymmetric theories have long provided a theoretical framework which can overcome many of the shortfalls of the Standard Model.
The major shortfall of Supersymmetry (SUSY), however, has been a complete lack of direct experimental measurements, to date.
Many of the present limits for SUSY particles have been set by the CDF experiment, which looks at pp collisions at ps = 1.96 TeV.
The CDF detector is further described here [].
Many SUSY particle decay chains end in leptons.
Since lepton events are relatively rare at hadron colliders, lepton signatures are a favorable channel in which to look for new phenomena.
The dilepton sample is also an interesting sample to search for new phenomena due to several curiosities.
First, there is the number of events that was observed in the top dilepton sample at CDF during Run I.
The predicted number of tt events in the dilepton channel in 110 pb−1 of data is 5.3 based on the measured cross-section of 6.5 pb (for the nominal theoretical cross-section of 4.7 pb the expected rate is 3.8).
Also, for a top mass of 174 GeV, approximately 20 % of dilepton events from tt are expected to have a lepton with ET&gt; 100 GeV and 15% are expected to have 6ET&gt; 100 GeV.
While within present statistical errors, these predicted values do vary from what was actually observed in Run I (Table 1).
In fact, of the five events that were observed with ET&gt; 100 GeV or 6ET&gt; 100 GeV, only two are kinematically consistent with coming from a 174 GeV top quark.
Second, there is the recently (Winter 2003) measured pT distribution for leptons in the top dilepton candidate sample.
This issue will be further discussed in Section 4.
For all of the scenarios discussed, only R-parity conserving SUSY models will be considered.
2 Stop Squark Signals in the Dilepton Channel
2.1 Production and Decay
The large Yukawa coupling of the top quark (due to its high mass) has the consequence that its supersymmetric partner, the stop quark, could be the lightest of the SUSY quarks.
From an experimental point of view, writing the SUSY Lagrangian in terms of mass eigenstates rather than the more customary weak eigenstates (˜tL and ˜tR) is useful.
I love user instructions.
One of my friends says that only quitters read user instructions.
I completely disagree.
It is a form of modern art, and often pure surrealism.
I look back with nostalgia on the distant past, when user instructions for anything were a rare phenomenon.
For example, my first gramophone only came with one sheet of paper with hieroglyphs showing how to connect certain components, all depicted through secret signs.
When an internal part broke years later, I offered the paper to a shaman who wasn't afraid to unscrew any panel.
With a grin, he advised me what the labyrinthine paper was suitable for.
It was a well-established aid during a chronic lack of toilet paper.
He playfully found the broken wire and allowed me to listen to my dear records again.
The new age brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer which just needed a grapefruit pressed down on it required about ten pictures.
The drawing with a description of how to insert one piece into another was especially charming.
It came in two parts, and there was no other possible procedure.
Doing it the other way round required a considerable effort and involved breaking the plastic parts.
My contempt for instructions ended with my Seat Leon.
The 2003 production year still had a booklet with instructions for minor repairs, including replacing the indicator light.
It was simple.
After a total of three steps, the job should have been done.
Unfortunately, the author of the manual failed to state that, while the light bulb was was replaced in just three steps:
1. Remove the cover.
2. Unscrew the broken bulb and screw in a new one.
3. Put the cover back.
the bulb on the left had a problem in the form of the battery cover.
At first I expected that inserting my upper right limb into the guts of the car would allow me to find a spring or a screw so I could detach the cover easily, and then I would follow points 1-3 suggested by the thrifty author of the service book.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
That cover had no place, no space for a slender Cinderella-esque hand, let alone that of an obese Silesian.
I lost half an hour of my life with no success to show for it whatsoever.
The situation was further intensified by my wife entering the garage, summoned by the shouts and words she heard coming out of my mouth, very unusually.
"What are you doing in here?" she asked ingenuously.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, but if I omit the vulgar terms only two publishable words remain.
I change the bulb.
"Why is it taking you so long?" she asked, taking a chance with a sentence that might have been the last of a long-running volume.
I explained the problem to her slowly, emphasising how I would torture the author of the manual, where the hot iron would burn the hand that wrote it, so that it could finally never write anything else. It was a mere introduction to the wide range of instructions from the film Witchhammer, including a specially commissioned bonfire on the knoll above Losinský castle.
"What about removing the box?" my wife hypothesised over the extrication of the battery.
In utter despair, I tried it and then steps 1-3 were as easy and fast as on the right side.
I thought that nothing could surprise me.
That was until the day I received a phone call from a colleague who was on the verge of collapse after being monitored by two officers from the State Drug Control Service.
I know him as a composed colleague who has experienced both the possible and impossible in the field and who is able to recount wild stories in an unpeturbed voice.
"Imagine being fined for not having a guide to washing your hands," he said in a feeble voice.
I gradually pieced together the whole issue, which lay in the fact that he had no pictorial instructions on how to wash hands over the washbasin on the toilet used by patient.
The argument he submitted to the committee official was that adults usually wash their hands and that there is no need for pictograms to explain a habitual procedure carried out by decent people. It did not have the desired effect on her, however, and cost him a lot of money.
"That is not the case," she told him.
He was given to understand that the simple rinsing of lathery palms with flowing water is a primitive act at the Cro-magnon level, and that modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, must perform this ceremony in ten steps.
As such, it is necessary to inform people that they must release the water from out of the tap.
The entire process has a total of eleven stages, but at the end you are rewarded by the joyous knowledge that you have washed your hands exactly as instructed by the State Institute for Drug Control.
I have to say that by the end I was inspired and prepared a detailed plan for activities on the toilet.
In terms of defecation, the procedure is unified and doesn't cause any problems. However, due to certain differences between the sexes, with urination it is necessary to give two sets of instructions.
The problem remains the pictograms, because creating the perfect procedure requires an exact sketch of all the anatomical details, which could provoke a certain outrage among prudish toilet users, despite the fact that they can finally learn that they have been wiping their opening the wrong way their whole life.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs, slashes dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and slash its interim dividend by 72 per cent as it started another restructuring programme to tackle the pressures facing its business.
The job cuts, which Chief Executive John Fallon said will mostly come late in 2018 and in early 2019, are in addition to 4,000 roles lost in its previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ($394-million U.S.) in May in a third cost-cutting programme to try to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said its outlook for the year was unchanged after it reported a 1 per cent rise in underlying sales in the first half to 2.05 billion pounds.
Kabul convoy attack: Nato soldier killed in suicide blast
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing a Nato soldier and wounding several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a Nato statement said.
Unconfirmed local reports say three civilians also died in the incident in the city's Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest violence to have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque blast in Herat.
On Monday a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A Nato statement said that Thursday evening's blast happened when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "personnel-borne improvised explosive device."
The statement said that all those injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major source of concern to Nato forces based in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, Afghanistan saw at least 1,662 civilian deaths in the first half of 2017, with about 20% of those in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out that attack.
On 31 May, a huge bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs up whether to increase the number of US troops aiding the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
Better Late than Never: Social Stratification and Higher Education through the Life Course
Timing of life-course events is known to be vary by the individual, with education no exception.
Timing of education in China is particularly irregular, yet what little research there is on the topic has primarily focused on only a small segment of the population, persons who returned to cities after having been sent to rural areas during the Cultural Revolution.
This paper demonstrates the widespread nature of graduation at non-normatively late ages between the 1990 and 2000 Chinese censuses.
It then looks at factors associated with the hazard of enrollment in higher education for three age groups, using the 1999 Survey of Urban Residents'
Family Life.
Progress through an academic system can be seen as a series of transitions in which each transition in the academic life-course is conditional on the outcome of the previous one, and individuals and their families (consciously or unconsciously) rationally estimate the likely outcomes of future transitions based on the transitions they have already made.
For instance, the choice to attend academic rather than technical high school precedes the decision whether or not to enroll in college, and less advantaged students might estimate lower future performance in school as well as lower future returns to academic high school in comparison with technical high school.
Social (dis)advantage is thus a cumulative process of tracking experienced across many transitions (Breen and Goldthorpe 1997).
The relationship between educational attainment and social origins has been shown to depend on the distribution of schooling in the population as well as on the effect of social origins on the likelihood of making a particular transition to schooling (Mare 1981).
Although almost every country has experienced a major expansion of education in the last 50 years, class differences in transition rates have remained relatively stable over time even while gender disparities have declined (Breen and Goldthorpe 1997).
Much of educational stratification research has assumed continuous or near-continuous educational paths as normative, although it is known that educational disruptions can have substantial negative outcomes.
But what happens when individuals who seem to be on one trajectory or have already left school wish to increase their educational attainment?
Elman and O'Rand (2004) visualize three pathways of educational attainment: one of early education to advantaged persons (cumulative advantage), early school exits resulting in low wages for the least advantaged, and a third pathway of late education to those in the middle, who attend school in later life without experiencing the benefits associated with earlier attainment.
As the proportion of a population participating in higher education changes, more adults may re-enter the school system.
Indeed, education in later life is becoming more common in industrialized (Hamil-Luker and Uhlenbert 2002) as well as some developing countries (Qian 1994-5).
The proportion of the Chinese population with tertiary education has always been small relative to the entire population, but has fluctuated widely and is now rapidly expanding.
Chinese education policy in the twentieth century has been subject to major swings accompanying shifts in the state's view of national development (Tsang 2000).
In the 15 years after the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, the number of graduates of four-year universities increased by almost 10-fold as the central government concentrated on urban development, despite a slow-down during the Great Leap Forward (1958-1960) as the educational focus shifted to basic education in rural areas (Hannum and Xie 1994).
In the mid-1960's, the debate about national development centered on whether to encourage egalitarianism or focus resources whether they would be most effective (i.e. higher education that would produce experts who could stimulate the economy.)
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed a decision to delay an Obama-era rule requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, one day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
The EPA announced the decision to go ahead with the so-called "2015 Ozone Designations" late on Wednesday, saying it showed the agency's commitment to working with states.
"We believe in dialogue with, and being responsive to, our state partners," EPA Chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt in June had announced the EPA's intention to delay the ozone designations - in which existing smog pollution is measured in parts of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet tougher air quality standard - by one year to October 2018.

The EPA's website says breathing air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" like asthma.

Rethinking the Cultural Turn in Class Formation Theory-To be a Marxist or not?
In this paper, I will critically assess a culturist approach of class formation.
My central question is; how has a cultural approach advanced Marx's theory on class?
In my view, culturalists have not always substantially advanced Marx's class theory.
As Swell brilliantly shows, Thompson cannot avoid rigid economic determinism, despite his initial intention of avoiding determinism, and does not offer an alternative theory on class.
This will apply to other culturalists among Marxists.
Not only do they not prepare for alternative theories, but to step back, they seem to blur views on what elements of economic foundation determines classes and on what kind of class structure they see in society.
Among other culturalists, however, Bourdieu is an exception and radically develops class theory from Marx.
This paper begins with reviewing Marx's theory on class.
Drawing upon Sewell, next, I will examine Thompson's approach and Rose's notion of seriality.
My main argument is that Marxian culturalists are trapped in a culturalist's dilemma -attempt to escape, and yet are bounded to economic determinism.
Third, I will discuss how Bourdieu escapes from this dilemma.
Marx defines class in terms of the ownership of properties.
The capitalist society consists of those who own the means of production and those who sell their labor.
The most fundamental ground of class lies in economy.
Two more points are important.
First, classes are relational entity.
According to Wright, classes in Marx do not simply means to have different material interests but also that class relations are based on exploitation and antagonism (Wright 1997b: 39).
In short, classes exist in the antagonistic relations among people.
Ollman approaches this point in an interesting way.
Through intensive re-reading on Marx, he argues that class in Marx occupies a position in it akin to labor and value (Ollman1976:210).
People (workers), activity (labor), and the product (the commodity) have causal tie in capitalism, so that class is that the preferred Relation for encompassing the interpersonal ties which are established in its activity through its products (ibid.).
In a way, classes are locations to which people are assigned, in favor of the development of capitalism.
Furthermore, those locations connect and necessitate one another, thus serving for the circulation of capital.
A second distinct point of Marx's class theory is that the consciousness of actors is a key in the formation of class.
He argues;
[e]conomic conditions had first transformed the mass of the people of the country into workers.
The combination of capital has created for this mass a common situation, common interests.
This mass is thus already a class as against capital, but not yet for itself.

Singer Ladislav Bubnár wounded and bleeding!
The singer is relatively new here, but you may have heard about him in June of this year, when he a huge event on Czech soil, hosted by such prominent personalities as Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krainová and a number of others, moderated by none other than Leoš Mareš.
The purpose was simple, to show himself to the public and to introduce his music video for the song Sara, which was launched by the aforementioned celebrities.
Few people know, however, that the shooting of the music video in Russia did not go without a hitch, and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first big shoot with the stars of the Russian national ballet, and it did not go flawlessly.
The song Sara is very emotional and is about an unhappy affair between two lovers.
To make the scenes dramatic, in the video the singer's adversary had to punch him
At one point, however, he struck him directly on the nose so hard that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a blow I did not expect. I started bleeding immediately," Ladislav commented on the situation.
His colleagues and producers said that the situation was unfortunate and Ladislav failed to react in time.
Fortunately, the injury was serious enough to stop the shoot from continuing.
The young artist's music video is here, and you can watch the scene where he gets punched.
The unsuccessful version where he was bleeding was not used.
The Economics of Philippine Education: Costs, Benefits, and Policy Tradeoffs
Education ranks among the biggest industries in the Philippines today.
Indeed, the 1987 Constitution stipulates that the state should assign the highest budgetary priority to education.
The Department of Education (DepEd), which supervises primary and secondary schooling in the country, receives a bigger percentage of the national budget than any other department of government, and with almost half a million teachers, constitutes almost half of all employees in the civil service.
This does not include those teachers and students in private schools, or those involved in higher education.
That so many resources are invested in education raises the question whether the money is well spent.
Is education achieving the goals that society set out for it?
Could resources be aligned in such a way that more benefits can be derived and accrue to the nation at large?
The data needed to answer these questions are not exactly plentiful, and tend to be scattered in different places.
In heaven, Thomas Green (1994) notes, there will be no need for policy, as whatever is wanted will be available in limitless supply.
Policy is the attempt to adjust the conflict between different goods, all of which must be pursued, but which, taken together, cannot all be maximized (Green, 1994, 2).
In other words, there is an opportunity cost associated with every policy decision.
Good data can give a better view of the educational situation, and thus can inform policy making so that scarce resources can be spent optimally.
Ironically, developed countries have very good data on education, while developing countries like the Philippines that most need data to inform policy do not have them.
In this paper, I examine the available information about the education industry in the Philippines.
First, I review the main sources of data on the topic, including both traditional repositories of data and new media such as the internet and CD-ROMs.
I comment on the contents as well as the usefulness of each.
I then proceed to look at the costs and benefits of education to Philippine society.
Direct costs include all resources spent in education.
In particular, I focus on two key areas of spending—capital expenditures and expenditure on teachers’ salaries—which together represent almost all educational expenditures.
I then consider the benefits that accrue to Philippine society by assessing several indicators for the production of human capital, including scores on national and international achievement tests, persistence and completion rates, and employment in the marketplace.
Throughout the paper, the need to make tradeoffs between one area of spending and another, between quantity and quality, will be seen, highlighting the policy dimensions of education.
Sources of Data
The overall picture the literature gives of educational data is that they are collected mostly in categories requested by international agencies for cross-national comparisons, but which data local planners seem not to have enough skill to make full use of.
This is seen in the manner data are organized and presented by international and local instrumentalities, respectively.
Cross-national Data
The international organizations at the forefront of collecting educational data include the United Nations Education, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the World Bank, and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
The OECD, a grouping of twenty-nine mostly developed nations, has been collecting such data among their member countries for some time, but realized the need for similar data from their counterparts in the developing world.
In 1997, the World Education Indicators (WEI) was launched to collect educational data from eleven developing nations.
Governmental Funding for the Development of Self-Sustaining Communities: The Stabilization of the HIV/AIDS Crisis
At the end of 2006, over 39.5 million people were living with HIV globally.
The year saw over 4.3 million new infections, with over one-third of HIV-AIDS cases in sub-Saharan Africa, the epicenter of the pandemic (Global).
On a continent where two-thirds of the population lives on less that one or two dollars a day, the disease devastates poor communities (World Vision International).
Because HIV/AIDS can infect anyone (not just the young, elderly, and sick), the disease frequently infects middle-aged people in vital societal positions.
These people then can no longer function as agricultural workers, health-care providers, and teachers within communities (World Vision Aids Experience).
The United States, along with the Group of Eight leading industrialized countries, should increase funding for the development of HIV-AIDS-educated, sustainable communities in Africa and globally to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic.
Educated, sustainable communities will stabilize the pandemic by creating environments where those affected by HIV/AIDS have the necessary resources to combat the disease successfully.
Currently, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) is fighting the battle against the disease.
UNAIDS is an organization of ten smaller United Nations groups.
The organization does much of its work creating action plans for leading industrialized nations to follow to combat the disease.
UNAIDS presented a plan to stabilize and eventually even phase out HIV/AIDS in 2005 (Schroering).
This plan, titled the Universal Access Plan, discusses the current needs of the countries most seriously affected by the pandemic.
The Universal Access Plan outlines the necessary monetary support needed to combat HIV/AIDS globally, including a tiered system to yearly increase the amount of funding for HIV/AIDS. The underlying theory of the plan is that if the appropriate amount of financial support is received, HIV/AIDS could be so effectively subdued that infection rates would stabilize and begin to taper, eventually even diminishing.
The tiered system would provide complete funding for all necessary programs to stabilize infection rates by 2015, totaling approximately 100 billion US dollars of funding (Financial 13).
The necessary programs envisioned would include traditional programs that provide medicine, food, and sexual education, in addition to more innovative programs targeting some root-issues exacerbating the disease: sustainable community development for communities ravaged by HIV-AIDS, and education programs targeted at the myths and stigmas that surround and attribute to spread of the disease.
While the work UNAIDS did to create the Universal Access Plan is an amazing step in the right direction to eradicate HIV/AIDS, no leading country has yet collaborated with UNAIDS to enact the plan.
The United States and its global partners should be working with UNAIDS to complete the proposed plan.
After creating the Universal Access Plan, UNAIDS presented it to the Group of Eight (G8), a global needs awareness collation, which includes the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany, Russia, and Japan.
The G8, one of the most powerful global entities, showed great support for the Universal Access Plan; however, to date it has not implemented the plan.
Using the tiered scale-up plan, the G8 is more than capable of providing the prevention and education programs, medical therapies, sustainable-community programs, and ambitious attitude needed to start curbing infection rates and reducing the incidence of HIV/AIDS and related concerns.
However, the G8 has not lived up to its identity as a global leadership team.
The G8's past involvement in HIV/AIDS crises proves that it is the best candidate to enact the Universal Access Plan.
When the governments of the G8 countries work with HIV-affected areas, they motivate the local and national governments to make ambitious goals leading to stabilization of the virus (Financial 15).
Emergence of the Supra-Individual Realm in Hobbes, Rousseau and Spencer
Early social thinkers like Hobbes, Rousseau, and Spencer addressed social issues of concern to them by exploring the concept of the supra-individual realm.
Whether they called it Commonwealth (Hobbes) or society (Rousseau and Spencer), they were concerned with the relationship between the individual and the supra-individual.
In the examination of this relationship each author proposed an ontological model within which they defined the notions of individual and supra-individual as they conceived of them.
We can query these models for answers to particular questions such as: how did each of these authors conceive of the emergence of the supra-individual realm? Having engaged thus with the models, we can also ask: are these explanations sound
In the following essay I will use excerpts from Hobbes's Leviathan, Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality, and Spencer's On Social Evolution to examine the ontological models that they propose.
For each model I will identify the underlying assumptions; the definitions of individual and supra-individual; as well as, the interactions between the two realms.
Having established this basis, I will utilize each model to answer the question: what is the process by which the supra-individual realm emerges?
Finally, I will critically appraise the validity of the model and the explanations it provides.
Hobbes
Hobbes's model of the supra-individual, what he calls the Common-Wealth, is based on his conception of natural man, or the individual.
In a two-part argument, Hobbes first elaborates on the condition of natural man, using his assumptions about the character of natural man as the starting point.
In the second part of his argument, Hobbes contends that the Common-Wealth is the solution for the natural state of man derived in part one.
Hobbes begins Chapter XIII of Leviathan, titled Of the NATURALL CONDITION of Mankind, as concerning their Felicity, and Misery with the expansive statement: Nature hath made men so equall, in the faculties of body, and mind… (63).
He continues to postulate that because men have equal abilities, they have equal desires for attaining things.
And it is exactly this desire that leads men into a constant state of war.
Hobbes describes this progression thus:
if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies; and in the way to their End, (which is principally their owne conservation, and sometimes their delectation only,) endeavour to destroy, or subdue one an other.
(63)

Hobbes contests that there is no way for any man to secure himself (64) for in the constant state of war among equals he may find himself under attack by another at any time.

Initially man goes to war for material needs.
Once a state of war is established, he goes to war to secure his position.
And when war reigns unchecked he may go to war for trifles, as a word, a smile, a different opinion (64).

PROPERTY RIGHTS AND DECENTRALIZATION OF FOREST MANAGEMENT IN INDIA
In recent years, decentralization has emerged as an important means of institutionalizing participatory natural resource management.
Proponents suggest that decentralizing natural resource management leads to enhanced efficiency, equity and sustainability (Ribot, 2002).
In addition, decentralization tends to achieve democratization through giving people a greater say in their own affairs.
(Agrawal and Ostrom, 2001).
It is thus not surprising that decentralization has been adopted as a major strategy to achieve environmental conservation while meeting development goals.
In 1994, the World Bank reported that Of seventy-five developing and transitional countries with populations greater than five million, all but twelve claim to be embarked on some form of transfer of political power to local units of governments.
(Dillinger, 1994)
Devolution of property rights to users is the most commonly used instrument for decentralizing natural resource management.
This paper attempts to determine the conditions under which decentralization through devolution of property rights leads to enhanced equity, ecological sustainability and livelihood security.
It then studies a proposed legislation in India that seeks to use property rights to achieve forest management goals, and analyzes it to determine whether it can lead to effective decentralization.
The paper is divided into two main sections.
In the first section, I draw on existing literature to develop an analytic framework that may be applied to determine whether a proposed devolution of property rights will lead to effective decentralization.
Here, effectiveness is defined in terms of positive impacts on outcomes and activities – enhanced equity, ecological sustainability and livelihood security.
In the second section, I apply this framework to forest management in India.
Specifically, I examine the proposed Tribal Rights Bill that has generated considerable controversy in India.
The Bill seeks to award certain forest dwellers inalienable property rights in forest, with dual aims of enhancing livelihood security by righting a historical injustice, and encouraging conservation.
SECTION I: WHEN IS DECENTRALIZATION EFFECTIVE?
In this section, I begin by defining decentralization and property rights clearly.
I then identify four factors that determine whether decentralization of natural resource management through devolution of property rights can be effective in enhancing equity, ecological sustainability and livelihood security:
(i) extent of property rights;
(ii) security of property rights;
(iii) accountability and representation and (iv) local capacity.
Decentralization may be defined as any act in which a central government formally cedes powers to actors and institutions at lower levels in a political-administrative and territorial hierarchy (Ribot, 2002).
In the context of the management of natural resources, the powers ceded are the rights to make decisions over resources.
Agrawal and Ostrom (2001) define decentralization more simply as a strategy of governance, prompted by external or domestic pressures to facilitate transfers of power closer to those who are most affected by the exercise of power.
Behind these definitions lies the broad principle of subsidiarity, i.e. that decision making should be devolved to the lowest appropriate level (Meinzen-Dick et al., 1999).
The driving force for the strong trend towards decentralization in recent years is the belief that decentralized solutions deliver superior equity, efficiency and sustainability (Ribot, 2002;
Agrawal and Ostrom, 2001; Manor 1998 ; Ascher 1999).
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most compelling boxing match under 147 pounds in the near future, met each other for the first time Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top-five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia extended his right hand and said, "How you doing, champ?
Best of luck to you."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 on ESPN.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a potential showdown between the fighters would be "perfect sizing."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded.
"I moved up for Broner [at 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to come down to lightweight.
And he's got to move up to lightweight [135 pounds] and then we have a fight.
That's what the fans are asking for.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy he has to have Lomachenko fight a 135-pound debut bout later this year to set up a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also has interest in fighting the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell winner following their Sept. 23 lightweight title bout at the Forum.
"This fight could be on pay-per-view because all the fans have been asking about it," Garcia said, later expressing openness to fighting on whatever network offers the best financial package.
"We're the main names.
No other names can generate that kind of attention.
Whenever they're ready ... ."
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "a tremendous fighter," and may attend his Saturday bout.
But Lomachenko paused at lavish praise for Garcia, saying he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow, sorry Mikey ... you wanted the knockout."
Garcia said the focus was to show punching strength, then box.
They both said they can feel the momentum building for their own bout.
"This is the fight to be made.
No other fight creates as much attention and buzz.
I'm more than happy to work at it," Garcia said.
Said Lomachenko: "I've waited for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.
It will be a great fight."

A young couple disappeared without a trace 12 years ago.
Their car was recently found in the depths of the Volga.
The two young Russians, Ilja Zhirnov and Kira Cherkasov, had been missing since December 2005.
An extensive search for them was carried out, but to no avail.
The police eventually ended the search because of the lack of evidence.
The families of the missing couple lived not knowing whether they would ever find out what happened to them.
Twelve years later, the story has come to an unhappy end.
A diver found the wreck of their car lying on the bottom of the River Volga in the town of Cheboksary in Chuvashia.
The police only managed to identify the couple through the documents left in the car.
The documents survived an entire decade underwater, and without them the police would have taken much longer to determine the identities of the couple found.
The couple was last seen when Zhirnov borrowed his father's car to pick his girlfriend up from work.
The diver who discovered the car remains anonymous.
Their finding was reported to the police in Cheboksary, which dragged the car onto the shore the next day.
Investigators believe that the young couple's death was an accident caused by the icy road that runs around the river.
However, the investigation is continued, and further details will be published once it has been closed.

Leave for Family Responsibility in the United States
Introduction
The second wave of the feminist movement struggled for the entrance into the public sphere of women who previously had been confined to working in the home.
This movement has lead to many positive changes in the lives of both women and men in the workforce.
One such improvement is that women who are now able to compete for jobs, including high paying jobs, can support their families in the same manner as men.
This not only helps to empower women, but also allows men more freedom in their job choices as they need no longer be the sole breadwinner.
However, maternity and family responsibilities were omitted from this discussion, an oversight which is not universal.
For example, the feminist movement in the United States was shaped very differently from that in Europe, where maternity and mothers' rights were considered vital battles towards women's equality.
In the United States, the movement considered these rights special treatment.
While the view of feminists in the United States is shifting towards the European position, history cannot be changed (U.S. stands apart from other nations on maternity leave).
Because of this, the movement towards equality at work is by no means complete, the glass ceiling has not yet become a thing of the past, and the rights of maternal and paternal workers do not approximate those of workers in the rest of the developed world.
For instance, the United States and Australia are the only industrialized countries that don't provide paid leave for new mothers nationally…
(U.S. stands apart from other nations on maternity leave).
Further:
In a study from McGill University's Institute for Health and Social Policy, the United States, Lesotho, Liberia, Swaziland, and Papua New Guinea were the only countries out of 173 studied that didn't guarantee any paid leave for mothers.
Among the 168 countries that do, 98 of them offer 14 or more weeks of paid leave (Schweitzer).
With the hard work and dedication of organizations such as the Center for WorkLife Law, legislation and legal cases in the United States are starting to move in the proper direction towards rights that may finally help shatter the glass ceiling.
Through this advocacy, and congressional action enumerating the rights of pregnant women and new parents, employers will be forced to re-evaluate and update their policies on leave for pregnant women and family responsibilities.
Current Actors
There have been unsuccessful attempts in past administrations and in Congress to pass legislation requiring paid maternity leave, such as the Clinton administration‘s effort to give states the ability to use unemployment funds for such leave.
This particular idea was turned down by the Bush administration because of opposition from business groups concerned with increased contribution to state unemployment funds (U.S. stands apart from other nations on maternity leave).
Because of this slow movement in the government and the strength of the lobbying parties attempting to keep this legislation from passing, much of the fight for maternity and paternity rights has taken place in the workplace with mothers and fathers suing their employers when they find themselves being discriminated against due to their capacity as parents.
Parents of newborn children have not been alone in suing for family responsibility discrimination; there have also been cases of pregnant women and adoptive parents.
Partly due to the fact that there is no legislation for small businesses, and partly because current laws do not cover all discrimination, there have been many cases by individual citizens, spanning people who have been rejected for employment, passed over for promotion, subjected to hostile work environments, and terminated based solely on employers' negative assumptions (Preventing Discrimination Against Employees With Family Responsibilities: A model Policy for Employers, 1).

Final Integrative Essay
A Failed Design Or Designed To Fail?
The early years of the twenty first century saw a new trend in the manufacturing industry worldwide.
The outsourcing strategies adopted by various American manufacturing companies, benefited Indian manufacturers.
One such engine manufacturing company which grew exponentially due to this trend was Cummins India Ltd (henceforth referred to as CIL).
CIL is a subsidiary of Cummins Inc.
USA, and is the largest supplier of diesel engines in the Indian market.
It hires about 2000 people, out of which 800 are engineers.
The official vision of Cummins India limited is:
'Making people's lives better by unleashing the power of Cummins', and the core values that the company nurtures are 'Honesty, Integrity and Diversity'.
Along with engine manufacturing, the plant has many other support functions.
Broadly the plant has three functional areas, viz. manufacturing, engineering and technology, and materials management.
The various departments which directly or indirectly support these functions are Research and development, engineering, sourcing, materials, manufacturing, information technology, maintenance, marketing, finance, corporate office and other small functional departments.
For the purpose of this paper, we shall focus on the Sourcing department as our area of interest.
An insight:
At the beginning of the century, the directors of CIL felt the need to introduce a few new engine models to grow the business and meet new demands.
There was no department which could find and develop new suppliers, sign contracts with them and maintain and strengthen relations with them.
Thus, a new department was formed to handle these responsibilities.
It was called the Sourcing department.
The Head of the department, an Ivy League MBA and senior manager from a rival company, was appointed as the Senior Vice president (Sr. V.P.) of the organization.
The Sr. V.P. was in charge of six groups, made according to product families that they catered to.
Product families included castings, critical components, rubbers and seals, electronics and assemblies etc.
The sixth group was the 'Strategic sourcing' group, which was in charge of forming strategies for supplier development, training the suppliers and six sigma deployment.
The exact job descriptions, work instructions and procedures to be followed were developed by the senior managers, and were in place.
However, these procedures were not frozen, since they wanted to make the rules as they went along.
The six groups had six 'Sourcing leaders', who directly reported to the Sr. V.P. (Refer Org chart).
The groups had Sourcing managers who negotiated contract terms, signed deals with suppliers and oversaw the progress of product development.
The supplier quality improvement engineers (SQIE) made sure that the quality of products supplied met the specifications.
They also helped the supplier improve their quality.
They audited the suppliers every six months, and launched six sigma projects with them.
The 'Sourcing analyst' was responsible for the clerical jobs such as entering prices and quantities of orders in the ERP system, making sure the supplier delivered on time, and updating the databases.
Sourcing had two secretaries, and one Senior Finance Manager, who handled pricing decisions.
Evaluation of Behavioral and Cognitive Behavioral Theories and Interventions
Looking back to my undergraduate and graduate years in Korea, it is surprising how much I had been exposed to behaviorism and cognitive behaviorism without being fully aware of it at the time.
Psychology was defined as a scientific study of human behavior with a strong emphasis on the scientific part (i.e., rigorous methodology), and the goal of the discipline was to better understand and predict human behavior.
Although these statements may also be compatible with other theories in the field, they sound more like what a behaviorist might say.
I also remember that behavior was often separated into three components, thinking, feeling, and external behavior (which I now see as a very Western way of looking at behavior.
I will explain this in more detail later when I discuss the limitations of behaviorism).
The Theories course this term was a good opportunity to review behavioral and cognitive behavioral theories and interventions, clarify my misunderstandings about these theories, and become more sensitive to the influences of behaviorism in the field.
Here I will describe my assessment of behavioral and cognitive behavioral theories and interventions from the readings this term.
The specific questions that will be addressed include:
What issues and areas have been most important contributions of these theories?
What issues and areas have been least useful and/or explanatory? ⑵ How do my reactions to these theories compare to my reactions to previous theories and models of behavior presented in the theories course?
How do I understand the differences I have experienced?
What do I see as the strengths and weaknesses in applying behavioral principles in clinical contexts?
The contributions and limitations of behavioral and cognitive behavioral theories
In my opinion, the most important contribution of behavioral theories is the emphasis on the environment.
Most of other theories in the field focus mainly on the individual.
For example, psychodynamic theories emphasize a person's developmental history and unconscious dynamics, and how they determine his or her current functioning.
There is a consideration of interpersonal relationships (especially with the primary caretaker), but the focus seems to be more on how these environmental factors affect dynamics within an individual.
Cognitive theories examine how a person's thinking influence his or her feelings and behavior.
Environment is often mentioned, but what matters is how the person subjectively perceives it and not the environment per se.
Individual-focused theories such as psychodynamic and cognitive theories naturally see individual as the target of intervention.
An individual is not adjusting well because of his or her rigid defense mechanism or irrational thinking.
Individuals get the blame.
The aim of psychotherapy is to change the individual to better adapt to the environment.
Behavioral theories removed the blame from the individual.
A person's behavior is determined by the environment he or she is exposed to.
No matter whether this statement is right or wrong (although I think that this kind of decision cannot even be made), I see this as an important shift.
Asymmetric Stock Price Response to Firms' Earnings Announcements
Abstract
This paper examines the asymmetric stock price response to good news and bad news in the event of firms' earnings announcements.
A modified event study analysis of firms' earnings announcements shows the existence of asymmetry in stock price response.
The effects of industry-specific factors such as the Herfindahl index, CEO compensation, firm credit rating, and firm size on asymmetric stock price response are studied.
This paper has three results.
First, on average, the stock price responds more to bad news than to good news.
The difference in responses, although small, is statistically significant.
Second, there is large heterogeneity across different industries.
For example, some industries respond to bad news, while other industries do not respond, or even respond positively.
Third, the variance of the stock price response to the earnings announcements has a larger effect on the asymmetry in stock price response than the magnitude of the stock price change itself.
Finally, the effects of industry-specific variables on the stock price response are investigated.
Introduction
Asymmetric stock price response to earnings announcements has long been an interesting and important topic in accounting, finance and economic research.
This paper empirically investigates the existence of asymmetric stock price response to abnormal earnings both at aggregate and industry levels.
These asymmetries are identified by comparing the response of the stock price to good news to the response of the stock price to bad news.
In order to uniformly measure asymmetry in stock price response, the difference between actual earnings and analysts' mean forecasts are defined as abnormal earnings.
Positive abnormal earnings are categorized as good news and negative abnormal earnings as bad news.
This method gives an ideal measure for information about firms' earnings because it measures quality as well as quantity of information.
In addition, the dependence of the asymmetric stock price response on the industry that the firm belongs to is also examined.
This paper investigates if the average asymmetric stock price response in an industry is related to industry characteristics, such as the Herfindahl index, CEO (Chief Executive Officer) compensation, credit rating information, and firm size.
There has been few quantitative research performed at the industry level to detect the asymmetric stock price response.
This paper gives an interesting motive to investigate the reason for the different stock price responses between industries.
Quantitatively, this approach has some advantages in that asymmetric stock price response in each industry is easily detected using a simple OLS specification, and the interaction of the industry-specific variables with abnormal earnings can be analyzed to identify the effect of each industry-specific variable on the asymmetry in stock price response.
In fact, there is a large body of research on asymmetric stock price response, and an equally large one on the relationship between key industry-specific factors and voluntary disclosure or earnings management.
However, there has been little work linking these two studies.
This paper examines an empirical link between these two studies.
I find that there exists asymmetry in stock price response in aggregate level.

New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment tests released
The latest results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden subjected to a new method of medically assessing their age show that over 80 percent tested were judged to be older than 18, but not everyone has faith in their accuracy.
Sweden's national Forensic Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests earlier year.
They are designed to make age assessment during the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failings in assessing the correct age of some refugees claiming to be underage.
To date Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period between mid March until July 31st, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or over, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the subject was "possibly 18 or over."
In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18."
The tests are only carried out in cases where the person's age is in question.
According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with previous months.
"We see no big difference in the statistics from previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about their age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 instances that "suggest the person examined is 18 years or older."
When newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 results released however it found that in 243 of the cases the person had openly stated that they turn 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which consists of taking X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, then having dentists and radiologists analyse them, has also been criticised in some quarters.
One sceptic is Karolinska Institute endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I've had reason to think about this, and I don't think the type of measurement being used should be.
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure we shouldn't pretend that we can," he told newspaper Metro.
The Forensic Medicine Agency's Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests however: "In general you can say that the risk of inaccurately judging a child to be an adult is small.
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in which case it's around 10 percent."
A Defense of Ontological Relativity
Quine's famous claim that meaning is indeterminable has raised objections from both linguists and metaphysicians.
My goal in this paper is to offer a defense of the indeterminacy of meaning against these objections.
As a result, my arguments will constitute a defense of the well known consequence of the indeterminacy of meaning: the doctrine of ontological relativity.
I begin by presenting the empirical constraints of a naturalist theory of meaning.
Both, indeterminacy of meaning and ontological relativity follow from this.
I offer two strategies purported to show how this works.
As I will argue, the objections raised fail to deter both strategies and, thus, leave the indeterminacy of meaning still on its feet.
Unsurprisingly, this result casts some doubt over the claims defended by theorists of meaning and metaphysicians who have assumed that meaning is determinable and that ontology is relative to theory.
Naturalism and Behavioral Meaning (some assumptions)
When trying to understand Quine's argument for ontological relativity it is important to have two background ideas in mind.
First of all, Quine assumes that - as he argued in his famous Two Dogmas of Empiricism [1951] - the path between philosophy and the natural science has no gaps.
As he argues, there is no fundamental cleavage between metaphysics and the empirical sciences.
This latter idea is supported with the assumption of a naturalist view, which according to Quine implies that knowledge, mind and meaning are part of the same world that they have to do with and they are to be studied in the same empirical spirit that animates natural science [Quine,1968,185].
These two ideas together yield the limits within which philosophical research is to be done.
Philosophy is not supposed to be less empirical nor more metaphysical than, say, psychology.
These boundaries are incredibly important when we turn to the theory of meaning.
For all the evidence available to an empirical theory of meaning will be overt linguistic behavior.
Given our empirical constraints, the evidence is reduced to the speaker's dispositions to linguistic behavior.
The crux of these ideas is that all there is to meaning, and for that matter all there is to a naturalist approach to meaning, is behavior.
This can be summarized simply as follows: meaning is behavioral meaning.
The two articles I have chosen to review and analyze based on class discussions and readings focus on quantitative research done in the area of depression among Latino/a adolescents living in the United States.
The first article (Roberts, Roberts,&amp; Chen, 1995) discusses research approaches in which Latino/a youth are compares Latino/a youth with Anglo youth in regard to levels of depression and suicidal ideation.
This article also examines gender differences in depression and suicide ideation among both the group of Latino/a adolescents and the sample of Anglo adolescents.
The authors discuss a study in which Latino/a youth reported higher levels of depression and suicide ideation than Anglo youth.
Furthermore, Latina girls reported higher levels of depression compared with Latino boys and Anglo girls.
In the second article, the authors (Cuellar&amp;
Roberts, 1997) do not compare Latino/a youth with non-Latino white adolescents or other ethnic minority adolescents.
Instead, the researchers discuss a study aimed at examining differences in depression between low and high-acculturated Latino/a adolescents, boys and girls, high and low SES status adolescents, and Latino/a youth who self-identified as either Mexican American, Mexican National, or Hispanic.
The researchers found significant differences between various groups and conclude that these differences are due to cultural differences (e.g., ethnicity, SES) among the sample of Latino/a youth.
I will draw from class readings and discussions to criticize aspects of the research approach of both articles, and I will examine the feasibility of employing alternative research approaches to enrich current research on the psychological well-being of Latino/a adolescents.
By doing so, I will move back and forth between the two articles I have chosen to review.
This critique, however, is not an exhaustive one.
There are many ways in which one may critique other scholars' research..
In this paper, I will highlight those aspects that are most obvious to me.
The main strength of both articles is that the researchers investigate the psychological-well being of Latino/a youth in the United States.
Research on adolescents in general is scarce and research on ethnic minority adolescents is even scarcer.
Therefore, I view research discusses in the two articles as an important first step in exploring the well-being of Latino/a children.
One of the weaknesses in both articles is the employed research methodology because it is based on a comparative/deviance approach.
Latino/a children are compared with Anglo children, Latina girls are compared with Latino boys, and Latino/a children are compared against each other.
At least three of our course readings criticize the current practice in psychological research of using deviant or comparison models when conducting ethnic minority research and research examining the well-being of girls and women.
These researchers argue that these models view ethnic minorities from the perspective of traditional White cultural patterns or lifestyle.
That is, comparative research approaches are based on the assumption that behavior patterns, disorders, and values are universal across populations.
For example, researchers who compare Latino boys with Latina girls in measures of depression assume that boys and girls do not differ in the way they may experience, express, and conceptualize depression.
Similarly, researchers who compare Latino/a youth with Anglo youth, frame their research question with the assumption that depression is a problem experienced among Latinos/as alike and that it is expressed and conceptualized in the same way.
Deviance models, in addition to making above-mentioned assumptions, assume that people who deviate from universal behavior do not meet normal standards and are thus, inferior or abnormal.
Trump threatens the President of Mexico over the phone.
In a phone call to Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto this January, American President Donald Trump threatened that he wouldn't meet him if he publicly stated that his country would not pay for the construction of a wall between the US and Mexico.
During the conversation, Trump said that he would arrange the financing somehow, although he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Similarly, Trump also spoke openly to the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This has emerged from transcripts of the talks published by the US daily The Washington Post on Thursday.
Trump made the construction of a wall on the southern border with Mexico a major promise in his campaign last year.
In Trump's first interview with the Mexican President shortly after he took office, he undiplomatically rebuked Peña Nieta for criticising his wall-building plan.
He described the country's southern neighbour as a growing political problem, and urged the Mexican president not to publicly state that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You cannot say that to the press," Trump repeatedly urged in a discussion on 27 January, and threatened to break off contacts with the Mexican President if he continued to issue defiant statements.
He will figure out the funding somehow and it will work out eventually.
"But if you say that Mexico won't pay for the wall then I don't want to meet you anymore, because it is unacceptable to me," said Trump, according to the American daily.
He then claimed that the wall was as the least significant thing they would talk about, but politically it is probably the most important.
Trump issued the executive order to build the wall shortly after coming to power.
Mexico is rejecting the construction and financing of a 3200-kilometre-long wall, and the relations between the two countries have become critical.
At the end of March, Trump said that the United States would pay for the project.
Trump finally met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the G20 summit in Hamburg in July.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump's phone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28.
The head of the White House said that the conversation was ridiculous.
This was the outcome of an exchange of views on the agreement that will see Australia grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States accepting persons from internment facilities in the Pacific Island states.
At first Trump considered the deal to be absurd, but later conceded to it.
"You can certainly say that this is not the deal you created, but you will have to stick to it," Trump told Turnbull.
In some parts, the phone conversation with Turnbull was almost jovial, for example, when Trump approved of Australia's refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats.
"You're worse than me," joked Trump.
The tone of the conversation suddenly got sharper.
"I hate accepting these people," said Trump.
They're bad, I can assure you.
That's why they're in prison now.
"They're not going to be great people who go to work for the local dairy," he said.
During the conversation, he also said that a fugitive could become the Boston terrorist in five years.
Trump had telephone conversations with a large number of world statesmen at the end of January, about a week after coming to the White House. He often spoke to several leaders in a single day.
The call with Turnbull finally proved to be the least pleasant for the whole day.
Before he finished, he stressed that he had previously had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Rana's killer was executed before a crowd.
Her father also watched.
The execution took place in a square in the Yemeni capital Sanaa.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose little Rana Almatari, who lived in his neighbourhood, as his victim.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl and took her to his father's house, where he raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
He then raped her body, which he tossed near a mosque.
The young girl's violent death affected the entire country, which is currently facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari was in the first row of a thousand-person crowd, which gathered together to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was condemned under Sharia law.
After the execution, the victim's father shared his feelings with the media.
I feel a new person.
It felt like a weight was lifted.
It is a new day in my life.
Other members of the family were also present, shouting the slogan "long live justice" along with the crowd.
The rapist was brought to the square in a police van, which he was then dragged out of.
The police officers tied him around his waist.
One of the members turned his weapon against him, firing a shot from the immediate vicinity.
The crowd present celebrated each round that was fired.
Mr. al Almatari told the MailOnline that justice was done in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah and Sharia Law have won," he added.
I stood on Liberation Square in Sanaa and waited for the execution of my daughter's murderer.
Then the whole family went to the morgue.
We took Rana's little body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
Both my wife Jamileh and I are grateful that justice has been done.
The police were afraid that the crowd gathered in the square would succumb to hateful madness, grab the killer and lynch him.
The execution was ordered by a court under the law of the Shiite Houthis.
Maghrabi was originally sentenced to 100 lashes when he was arrested, but his actions provoked such outrage that the judge decided to apply the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl's disappearance on 27 June.
Rana's family knew him well.
When the police searched the cellar of his house, they found evidence that the man had planned his actions.
Mr. Almatari described him as a monster.
What could his motivation have been?
Even a beast would have been more merciful to Rana.
"Our family has no enemies, and the wounds sustained by Rana's body were awful," he told the media.
"Rana disappeared in the afternoon, and we informed the police the same day. We told the newspapers and all the TV stations, and there posters with her photo hanging everywhere," he continued.
It is generally believed the police got a tip off from the murderer's parents, who suspected their son of the atrocity.
Jamileh, the girl's mother, had to be hospitalised after she learned that her daughter's body had been found.
Rana had gone out to play with the other children in the neighbourhood.
I went to see where she was 10-15 minutes later.
We looked everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block. Our friends took their cars and drove around, but our search was in vain.
The residents of Yemen were disgusted by the crime and began gathering in front of the police station where al Maghrabi was held, demanding immediate punishment.
A representative of the Ministry of Justice read out a report of the investigation into the crowd to appease them.
The accused apparently showed no regret for his actions.
Police officers read out the sentence just before the deed was carried out, but the convict only glanced at his executioner briefly.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but many recordings were also shared on the Internet.
West Virginia governor announces he's switching parties
The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he's switching parties.
"Like it or not like it, the Democrats walked away from me," Gov. Justice said.
"Today I will tell you with lots of prayers and lots of thinking ... today I will tell you as West Virginians, I can't help you anymore being a Democratic governor."
The rally erupted in cheers.
"So tomorrow, I will be changing my registration to Republican," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would tell you it's time to run another play."
Mr. Trump promised earlier a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, having inherited a coal business from his father.
He's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee released a statement Thursday night saying "Governor Justice's party switch is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather obstruct than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governorships and control of the fewest state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is leaderless from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.

Coe praises 'candid' Russian apology for doping scandal
Global athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised what he described as a candid apology from Russia over a doping scandal on Thursday but reiterated it was not the moment for the country to be readmitted to the sport.
Russia's athletics boss Dmitry Shylakhtin told an IAAF Congress, held on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, that his country's ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry to "all athletes who have had gold and silver medals snatched from them at competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favor of maintaining the ban, imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very candid response today, a very candid presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress was pleased ... that the Russian federation recognized themselves that they have been through some pretty torrid times and are doing everything possible to make sure the federation is reengineered."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress is being made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this was not the moment to reinstate Russia," said Coe.
"We need to do everything over the next few months to normalize this situation.

Schools and the development of national identity in young children:
A justification for comparison
Traditional nation-states that base their membership on stories of ancestry and blood have boundaries that are usually less porous than those of constitutional democracies that base membership on the acceptance of certain institutions ad practices.
And because there is no single and easy test of identity, constitutional democracies that embrace people from many different cultural groups need practices that reproduce their national identities… the common school has been the most important instrument for doing this.
- Walter Feinberg, Common Schools/ Uncommon Identities
Introduction and brief overview of my dissertation
Citizenship education has historically been, in some shape or form, an overarching goal of public schooling in every society.
In multicultural societies, however, this becomes even more of an imperative.
Unlike ethnically homogenous societies where a shared genealogical lineage provides a common national anchor, multicultural societies typically rely on what Michael Ignatieff terms civic nationalism where national identity is based on the commitment to a set of common institutions and political rights.
As such, school systems in these societies become even more important, bearing the mantle of bring together children from different backgrounds by developing this commitment.
Amid the current unprecedented global transmigration, the nationalization process of individuals has come into sharp focus, and subsequently, so has this role of the school.
Many countries are becoming increasingly multicultural and are wrestling with the tension between ethnic autonomy and national cohesion.
By comparing two multicultural societies, Singapore and the United States, my dissertation seeks to understand how schools have been tasked to bring together children from different backgrounds through a commitment to a shared national identity, and the ways in which children in two countries develop an attachment to the nation.
In this paper, I justify why a comparative study is important in light of my research focus, and make the argument that understanding how two distinct societies engage schools in the process of national identity development will contribute to a broader understanding of how multicultural nations respond similarly or differently to the critical challenges of a rapidly evolving global demography.
The theoretical framework for my dissertation draws on scholarship in three fields: i) the new sociology of childhood in childhood studies, ii) the discursive nature of national identity development in political science, and iii) the nationalizing function of schools in education.
First, the fairly recent sociological perspective for studying children considers children as active participants in a variety of social scenarios.
These theories contend that children should not be seen as passive receptors of adult instruction but as active agents who effectively negotiate with and evaluate their social world.
Second, this validation of children’s individual agency in their identity formation aligns tightly with emerging research in political science that argues for the discursive nature of national identity formation.
This paradigm contends that national identity is a narrative we construct to make sense of who we are and therefore not completely stable or immutable; it is a fluid construction generated and expressed differently by different individuals in various contexts.
Third, we know that schools have always been charged with- among other things- producing good citizens.
What is more controversial, however, is what citizenship and national identity represent in a multicultural society, and the obligations of the public school in this regard.
Recent scholarship has highlighted the debate about whether it is possible- or even desirable- for schools to advance a single common national identity in the face of a society that is becoming increasingly multicultural.
For the purposes of this paper, the last two paradigms are particularly important.

The CzechTrade national commission is won by František Savov's company, who is prosecuted by the state.
The public commission by the CzechTrade state export agency was given to František Savov's publishing house Mladá fronta.
The officials gave him full points for all the qualitative criteria.
They did not mind the fact that the Czech state is prosecuting Savov for tax fraud and asking for his extradition to the Czech Republic.
The export agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, CzechTrade, announced a public tender for the four-year provision of editorial content for BusinessInfo in April.
The commission was awarded to entrepreneur František Savov of the Mladá fronta publishing house and has a total value of 30.8 million crowns.
However the Czech police accused him of tax evasion in 2014 and has been pursuing him in absentia.
Savov fled to Great Britain and the Czech Republic has called for his extradition.
The case was noted on the server Aktualne.cz.
According to CzechTrade's basic criteria, 60% of the decision to award the contract was based on the price offered and the 40% on the appeal and quality of the proposal.
Savov's company was substantially helped by the second criterion.
According to information from Dotyk.cz, it received 100 points in all the parts referring to the qualitative criteria.
It was this result that put it ahead of the second-best candidate, the Vltava Labe Media VLM publishing house, which offered a better price.
While Mladá fronta operated on the basis of 404,900 crowns a month, VLM offered 324,350 crowns.
Unlike Mladá fronta, however, it received below-average scores from the judges for all qualitative criteria, with a total of 62 points.
Other organisations that took part in the tender include the consulting firm BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which is part of the Economia publishing house, like the Aktuálně.cz server.
The VLM publishing company has issued several objections to the outcome of the tender, considering its assessment to be unfair and insufficiently substantiated.
After their rejection, they decided to contest the outcome with the ÚOHS Úřadu pro ochranu hospodářské soutěže (Office for the Protection of Competitions).
It believes that CzechTrade acted in violation of the law.
"The claimant is convinced that the contracting authority made the decision on the selection of a public procurement contractor on the basis of a purely subjective assessment, clearly favouring the participant Mladá fronta at the expense of the claimant and other suppliers," reads the motion for the opening of proceedings submitted to the ÚOHS this week, which was published by the server Aktuálně.
According to Michal Klíma, CEO and Chairman of VLM, the selection committee's scores appear unjustified, and the 100% evaluation of Mladá fronta by all its members extremely suspicious.
"Every independent observer must consider such miraculous success on the part of one of the competitors unlikely and suspicious," said Klima.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
The CzechTrade agency will not comment on the public commissions until they are closed, on principle.
All the information about the above contract is lawfully published in the Profile of the contracting authority and in the public tender notice.
"A full written report will be published after the completion of the contract, but during the term of the contract we can not express our opinion about it," said Štěpán Dlouhý, media agent for Dotyk.cz.
Mladá fronta responded with a statement that it considers it extremely problematic for Economia publishing house to release an article on Aktuálně.cz relating to a competition concerning its own business interests.
However, that fact was mentioned in the article.
They may have been helped in the tender by the fact that they provided editorial services to the BusinessInfo portal for the previous four years.
The competition was first launched in 2013 when the Department of Industry and Trade was led by Martim Kuba of the ODS party.
The police accuses František Savov of tax evasion in connection with excessive VAT deductions for his companies, which caused the Czech state damages of up to 770 million crowns.
The Czech Republic has been requesting Great Britain for his extradition since 2014.
According to Savov, the person behind his criminalisation is head of the ANO movement, Andrej Babiš, whose sphere of influence includes the Mafra publishing house.
Last year a London court dismissed Savov's claim against the extradition, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved since last year, and we have not received any notification from the UK yet," Štěpánka Zenklová, a spokesman for the Prague City Prosecutor's Office, told Aktuálně.cz.
In addition to the ownership of Mladá Fronta, Savov was part of the Harvestor Limited firm, based in Cyprus, which controlled the Samson brewery in České Budějovice, and the Cypriot company Maraflex, which is profiled as an investment fund and buys up failing businesses.
It should also control Heavier Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which owes over three billion crowns.
In the past Savov was also associated with the seizing of property from the former Socialist Youth Organisation.

Word sense tagging includes two processes which are tagging assignment and tagging disambiguation.
Tagging assignment is to assign a set of possible or potential word sense tagging to every word.
Tagging disambiguation is to choose a proper word sense that satisfies the context.
Word sense tagging is considered to be the biggest unsolved issue at word level in natural language processing.
Although word sense tagging is similar to POS tagging, it is more abstract and difficult because of its focus on the aggregation relation of word meanings.
As early as 1950s, people started to work on the research of WSD.
A large variety of methodologies have been put forwarded.
However, at present stage, most of the current systems can handle the WSD for only a very limited number of multi-sense words.
There is still long way to go for WSD to reach the present level of POS tagging.
In Chinese NLP research area, WSD has been a rarely touched topic and relatively little effort has been paid to this important issue.
This paper is going to propose a technically feasible approach to improve the WSD of Chinese based on the relative maturity of POS tagging system.
1.2 What is the research problem
In order to make the computer have the same word sense discrimination ability as human, we must store in computer grammars and semantic and pragmatic rules as well. WSD methodologies can be grouped into four categories in terms of the methodologies used to acquire knowledge.
WSD based on dictionary knowledge.
Machine readable dictionaries and semantic domain dictionaries provide sufficient knowledge on word usages and word senses and therefore can be used as a resource for WSD.
Machine readable dictionary has become the major knowledge resource for WSD since 80s.
Typical machine readable dictionary-based methodology for WSD works this way:
It first computes the coverage of each word sense for ambiguous words and the senses of words in the context and then it chooses the sense with maximum overlapping as the current word sense.
Unfortunately, the correctness rate for this methodology is only 50% to 70%. There are several reasons for this comparatively low accuracy:
Firstly, traditional machine readable dictionary-based methodology does not make full use of the useful information of the phrases and examples in the dictionary.
Secondly, the word sense definition sentences in machine readable dictionaries are normally very short, and it is hence difficult to calculate the overlapping of those two kinds of definitions.
In many cases, there are zero overlapping between the word sense definitions of the ambiguous word and context words.
Thirdly, in practice, the inevitable combination explosion also greatly restricts the application of this method.
Finally. the dictionary is for human use and not for machine use.
In addition, there is also inconsistence in the dictionary itself, all these raise difficulty for knowledge retrieval.
Knowledge in semantic domain dictionary is also widely used for WSD.
How soccer's financial rules impact Neymar's move to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European soccer clubs will not disrupt Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will come further down the line for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, the governing body overseeing the European game which has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was funded without incurring huge losses.
Barcelona has been paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract and Neymar will command a salary that will run to tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly stump up the cash to sign Neymar and add him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend heavily on acquiring players but they have to counterbalance that with legitimate sources of income, allowing them to approach break-even on their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former France player believed that clubs who ran up huge debts in their pursuit of success were effectively cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs' debts to monitoring their losses instead.
The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich initially used at Chelsea in 2003 - buy a club with potential, and then spend heavily to improve the squad and build a global brand - become a tougher proposition.
During the current three-year FFP assessment period that runs through 2018, clubs can incur losses of 30 million euros.
And despite Platini being ousted in disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin is still committed to deterring excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will, for sure, reinforce the rules going forward," Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG will have paid Neymar's buyout clause in one lump sum, it can spread the amount for accounting purposes over the length of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee could be shown as a 44.4 million-euro cost in the annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 saw PSG, along with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, hit with the heaviest sanctions.
PSG was handed a fine of 60 million euros (then $82 million) - that was later reduced to 20 million euros - and ordered to limit its Champions League squads to 21 players for the 2014-15 season instead of the normal 25.
UEFA is on the lookout for clubs who might try to outwit its financial regulators by inflating their income through companies linked to a club's owners.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship was deemed to exceed standard market rates UEFA would not allow it to count as legitimate income.
That is what happened in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority sponsorship of PSG was inflated.
It has been reported that part of Neymar's PSG earnings could come via payments from the 2022 World Cup organizing committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver would be easy for UEFA's regulators to expose.
Past sanctions slapped on PSG means that UEFA will be even more watchful of any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA has not been in pre-emptive discussions with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said Thursday.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The last published accounts show that PSG made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015-16 on a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
Accounts for the last financial year are yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club expects turnover would grow by at least 30 percent on the back of the signing.
Clearly irritated to see one of soccer's biggest players leaving, the Spanish league tried to stymie Neymar's move, claiming that PSG will be breaching FFP.
"It is a clear case of 'financial doping', with the club and the state," La Liga President Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state funding a club.
"It is the consequence of the ownerships and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.
"Once a country owns a club, everything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fair Play because you can have different ways or different interests for a country to have such a big player to represent a country."
Friction is an important factor of workers' ability to grasp and manipulate work objects and their risks of developing work related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), since poor friction conditions require greater grip force to prevent slipping of objects, and repetitive forceful exertions, common in industries, are well known as the cause of MSDs.
Four laboratory studies were selected to examine the relationship between friction, load force, and grip force, with consideration of anesthesia or moistness.
These papers provided important insights to the relation between work force exertions on MSDs.
That the grip force is affected by the previous friction condition is important, because lifting an object with an unexpected friction condition may cause slipping.
It was observed in Westling and Johansson (1984) and was more investigated to find the adaptation of force coordination to friction condition changes between fingers and an object in their second paper, Johansson and Westling (1984).
However, they found the adaptation of force coordination to surface structure was lost under anesthesia of finger skin, which would enable to anticipate the effect of hand vibration and low temperature on grip force adjustment.
Sweat and moist condition is also an important factor in friction condition and hand tool design, since workers' hands are rarely sweat free and moistness can cause a poor friction condition in handles that can contribute to MSDs.
The variation of coefficient of friction (µ) due to sweat was detected in Westling and Johansson's two studies and was investigated as an independent factor in Buchholz et al (1988).
Moreover, overexertion (safety margin), lifting an object with unnecessarily high grip force, which would also contribute to MSDs, was investigated in Westling and Johansson's two papers and Frederick and Armstrong (1995).
Westling and Johansson's two papers, published in Experimental Brain Research, focused on motor controls, whereas Buchholz et al (1988) and Frederick and Armstrong (1995), published in Ergonomics, concerned with analysis and design of work.
Thus, Westling and Johansson varied materials as a way to study motor control, whereas Buchholz et al and Frederick and Armstrong varied materials to study friction as a primary objective.
Even though all four papers looked at the same topic, not every finding was agreed.
The observed grip forces for aluminum in Frederick and Armstrong (1995) were 20% lower than the minimum grip forces predicted with μ from Buchholz et al (1988), which can be due to the high standard deviations, variation in μ between subjects' fingers, different washing condition, different sweating rates, or different contact area.
In addition, the effect of friction condition on grip force was found in Westling and Johansson's two studies, whereas Frederick and Armstrong (1995) found subjects were not sensitive to friction effects at the overlapped range, which can be due to different tasks (static vs. dynamic), extra pinch force capacity availability, or different contact area.
Overall, important factors to determine friction condition and grip force were covered in four papers, suggesting controls of materials and environment in work place to prevent MSDs.
Also, it was realized that different hypothesis and different design of experiment could result in a huge differences in findings.
Study trend from investigating genuine phenomena and static tasks to applied simulation and dynamic tasks were observed.
1. Introduction
Friction is an important factor of workers' ability to grasp and manipulate work objects and their risks of developing work related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs).
Poor friction conditions, i.e., a slippery surface, require greater grip force to produce the same amount of push force than moderate conditions, as illustrated in Figure 1.
Since repetitive forceful exertions are well known as the cause of MSDs, poor friction conditions that cause high force demanding jobs, especially in the industry where workers have to perform same tasks repetitively for a prolonged time, can be a major factor of MSDs as well as cumulative trauma disorders (CTDs).
Figure 1:
Grip force and push force
Four papers were selected to examine the relationship between friction, load force, and grip force.
These papers came from two different bodies of the literature.
Westling and Johansson's two papers were published in Experimental Brain Research, and focused on basic motor controls, whereas the Frederick and Buchholz papers were published in Ergonomics and concerned with analysis and design of work.
Together these papers provided important insights to the relation between work force exertions on MSDs.
Specific factors considered included weight of an object, surface structures, previous friction conditions, anesthesia, static and dynamic load force changes, hand moistness, and grip force as well as slip force.
Laboratory experiments were conducted for all four papers, to investigate the effect of each factor.

A Discussion of Research into Cyclic Flow Variations in Internal Combustion Engines
Cycle-to-cycle flow variations in engines can cause cyclic combustion variations, decreasing combustion efficiency and increasing the likelihood of misfires.
Heywood discussed below determined that flow variations have a greater effect on cyclic combustion variation than shifting of the flame center and variations in the residual gas fraction, showing that cyclic flow variations in engines merit further study.
However, quantifying cyclic flow variations, and distinguishing macro-scale cyclic flow variations from small-scale turbulence can be difficult.
Ensemble-based Reynolds decomposition is a traditional method by which turbulence is quantified, but it does not account for cyclic flow variations.
Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), Gaussian filtering or filtration following Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used by some of the studies discussed below for the separation of turbulence, cyclic flow variations and the mean flow.
Others use flow characteristics other than velocity, such as swirl ratio or circulation, to measure cyclic flow variations.
These studies aim to create methods by which various data sets from different operating conditions may be compared, and, ultimately, minimize cyclic variations in engines.
Overview of Current Literature
Cycle-to-cycle variations in combustion are influenced by a variety of factors, such as variations in turbulence intensity, flame center shift due to convection, and variations in residual gas fraction.
In a study by H. Shen, P.C. Hinze, and J.B.
Heywood, these factors were taken into account in order to create a computer code that predicted the extent of cyclic variability in combustion.
This model was compared with experimentally obtained results, and was used to determine the extent to which each of the factors mentioned above affected cycle-to-cycle variation.
The study found that variations in turbulent intensity have the greatest effect on combustion variations, and that this effect decreases as the flame size increases.
This is because the growing flame is influenced by a larger portion of the in-cylinder flow field, leading statistically to a decrease in the variation of the turbulent intensity affecting the flame.
It was also found that flame center shift only influences the later stages of the combustion process, and cyclic variations in residual gas fraction have almost no effect on cycle-to-cycle variations in combustion [1].
As the in-cylinder turbulence was not experimentally determined in this study, the average turbulence intensity was simply set equal to 1.8 m/s, which was approximately half the mean piston speed.
The turbulence intensity near the spark plug for each cycle was then determined using the hypothesis that a larger local gas convection velocity indicates a larger local turbulence intensity.
However, using an optical diagnostics method, such as particle image velocimetry, would have provided more accurate information about the in-cylinder flow field.
In order to understand how cyclic variations in turbulence intensities affect cycle-to- cycle variations in combustion, in-cylinder flow fields and turbulence need to be studied more closely.
A study by Y. Li, H. Zhao, et al. characterizes tumble and swirl flows in a motored four-valve spark ignition engine.
In this study, the single-cylinder engine’s intake valve shrouds were designed to enhance tumble motion.
Swirl motion was created by plugging one of the intake ports.
Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was used to find the two-dimensional velocity distribution every 30 crank angle degrees (CAD) during the intake and compression stroke for 80 cycles at 1200 rpm.
It was found that swirl motion is generated at the end of the intake stroke and continues till the end of the combustion stroke, while tumble motion is created early in the compression stroke and breaks up in the later part of the stroke [2].
This study also found that while the cyclic variation of swirl motion is significant, cyclic variation of tumble motion is much larger.
This cyclic variation includes both turbulence and cycle-to-cycle variation of bulk flows.
The ensemble-averaged mean velocity distribution may be used to represent the swirl motion in individual cycles, but the mean velocity field is not really representative of individual cycles with tumble motion.
This may be due to the moderate tumble ratio of 0.9 used in this experiment, or due to some out-of-plane velocities resulting from the tumble vortex axis not being perpendicular to the plane in which the velocity distribution was measured [2].
It was also found that the root-mean-square (RMS) velocity fluctuations for swirl motion becomes homogeneous over the field of measurement during the later part of the compression stroke, while the RMS velocity fluctuation distribution for tumble motion remains heterogeneous [2].
This further indicates the difficulties of characterizing tumble motion using average values.

Sparta midfielder Rosický: Changes are painful, but we have to keep believing.
Sixteen thousand fans were up on their feet applauding.
Tomáš Rosický goes to ground.
This was the same scene as the Sunday match against the Bohemians.
The Sparta midfielder livened up the game against Red Star Belgrade and set up several goals, but his teammates couldn't convert them in the end.
Pumped up by new multi-million reinforcements, the team from Letná ended up in the second round of the Europa League.
Was it hard to make something out of the match after the goal by Belgrade?
After the goal was scored, we needed to score four, which was difficult for us.
We wanted to avoid losing at least, so as to build up our self-confidence to get something out of it for the next match.
We had several chances.
We have to work together as a team and bring our game forward.
Why did it take Sparta so long to come into the match?
The match was terribly overworked.
Out opposing teams combinations were much better than ours.
We didn't get anywhere, and we'd only had one shot by half time.
Of course, that's very little when you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, and in the final third we managed to play at their level.
But you have to push your opponents into these positions more often.
Was the high number of changes to the configuration a problem?
Of course, this is one of the pains you have to deal with when a new team is formed.
We had only played three matches together and the configuration is still changing.
The coach needs to find the ideal 11 that fit together.
Is it encouraging for you to have played for part of two matches in a row?
They're still just parts of the match.
I myself don't know how my position will develop and when I will be able to play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place within Sparta?
We have to be, otherwise it doesn't work.
It's the same as with injuries.
If you don't have faith, then you can't go back.
Sparta made a decision and we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
The fans came back in large numbers, but when they left they were embarrassed.
What can you tell them?
It was another great away trip, just like with the Bohemians.
I'm really sorry that we couldn't make them happy with a better performance.
I would like to give them a reason to come to the next one.
We can thank them for coming.
They won't remember these trips when it's been 15 years since I played here.
Can a cupless season be at least an advantage for the league?
At the moment we're fighting against ourselves. We will keep playing, so it's not such an advantage for us.
An entrepreneur is facing ten years in jail for extreme tax avoidance.
The Constitutional Court dismissed a complaint from businessman Jiří Toman, who is to due spend ten years behind bars for tax avoidance.
The calculated damage amounts to 645 million Czech crowns.
In his complaint, Toman claimed that that the justice violated his fundamental rights, stating that the factual findings of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc are not entirely complete.
However, the Constitutional Judges found the complaint to be unjustified, as CTK learned from the court database.
The Constitutional Court is not a court of appeal.
"It cannot assess the factual or legal misconduct allegedly committed by the ordinary courts for a fourth time if it does not constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the resolution states.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict took effect in November 2015, when it was confirmed by the High Court in Olomouc.
Toman was in custody in Argentina, where he was found at the time of the decision by the Constitutional Court.
The penalty imposed is in the higher end of the statutory limitations, which corresponds to the damage incurred according to the verdict.
The High Court described the case as extreme tax evasion that had a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
The man served as Chairman of the Board of Directors for the company World Servis from 2005 to 2008.
The damages of 645 million Czech crowns only refer to the period from January to July 2008, and according to an expert the total evasion exceeded one billion.
For procedural reasons, it was no longer possible to try Toman for the full amount.
According to the charges, World Servis did not include complete invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT and excise duties to the order of at least tens of millions of Czech crowns, the company only paid taxes amounting to just a few hundred thousand.
World Servis and some of the companies it has done business with are related to entrepreneur Radomir Vybíral, who has been charged with 13 years in jail for VAT fraud over driving matters.
The Constitutional Court also dismissed his complaint.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally in an already volatile region to crumble.

EXPLANATION, SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING, AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE USE OF INFORMATION
In this paper I explore the relations between some influential theories of explanation and its relation to scientific understanding.
As we will see, while these theories differ in their claims about what the essence of explanation is, they otherwise contain few conflicting claims as regards the relation between explanation and understanding.
I shall suggest that we should add to the picture these theories together paint the idea of having a good understanding of something as having an ability to make certain kinds of use of known facts or reliable theories about what we are trying to explain.
The other ideas of the relation between explanation and understanding I will discuss are all subsumed, I shall argue, under this theory of understanding.
Its truth or correctness would, thus, explain the intuitive appeal of the other ideas to be discussed.
We can start with Hempel's
Deductive-Nomological Model of Explanation (the D/N Model): to be able explain some phenomenon's occurrence is to be able to infer the statement that it would occur from premises about antecedent circumstances and laws of nature.
Thus if it follows logically from certain premises about the laws governing some kind of phenomenon and certain statements about what the antecedent conditions are that some event or phenomenon will or would occur, then we have an explanation of this event or phenomenon.
Discussing the relation between his notion of explanation, on the one hand, and the idea of scientific understanding, on the other, Hempel writes that such expressions as 'realm of understanding' and 'comprehensible' do not belong to the vocabulary of logic, for they refer to the psychological or pragmatic aspects of explanation. (413)
Commenting on this remark, Friedman writes
In the sense in which such concepts as 'understanding' and 'comprehensible' are clearly pragmatic, 'pragmatic' means roughly the same as 'psychological', i.e. having to do with the thoughts, beliefs, attitudes, etc. of persons.
However, 'pragmatic' can also mean subjective as opposed to objective.
In this sense, a pragmatic notion… is a relative notion.
But, a concept can be pragmatic in the first sense without being pragmatic in the second…
I don't see why there can't be an objective or rational sense of 'scientific understanding', a sense on which what is scientifically comprehensible is constant for a relatively large class of people.
…I don't see how the philosopher of science can afford to ignore such concepts as 'understanding' and 'intelligibility' when giving a theory of the explanation relation.
There is a sense of pragmatic that I believe to be highly relevant in this context, but which Friedman seems to overlook.
This is the idea of being able to make practical or further theoretical use of information.
More on this below.
Another quick comment about these quotes: one reason why the philosopher of science can ignore concepts such as understanding and intelligibility could, it might be suggested, have to do with just how tight the relation between them and that of explanation is.
It may be that, given the close relation between these concepts, it is more informative to explain explanation in terms of other concepts.
(This seems to be Lewis's view of this matter.)
Again, more on this below.
Back now to Friedman.
Friedman thinks it unfortunate that Hempel is not keener to connect his theory of explanation with the notion of understanding.

Nostalgia Goes Niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
So this iteration of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the characters' '80s glory days; for the '90s grunge era (around when the masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV); and for itself - that is, for 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it's both a sendup and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent reminiscence.
But as a franchise, it feels like it's running out of time.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurdist humor (it included an origin story for a talking can of vegetables, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
By doubling down on the core gag - middle-age actors playing horny kids coming of age - it made the impossibility of recapturing the past part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later," with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody more scattershot, including a riff on '90s stalker flicks like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."
At one point a character rummages through an Apple Powerbook, some in-line skates and "a bunch of other things from 1991."
Many of the core stories are the same.
Sweet-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
And there's another battily villainous plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now abetted by George H. W. Bush (a well-inhabited impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the digressions.
It's especially fun to see the forever-young Mr. Rudd, sporting Matt Dillon's soul patch from "Singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like a geezer.
It's the moments of random lunacy that might power this franchise on, like a kind of recursive "Seven Up!" series, until it reaches what I assume will be its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will have the gang going to see the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to a different brand of nostalgia: the Cold War revivalism of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW," with its East versus West wrestling iconography.
The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas directing, purports to be found TV: a Romanian 1980s buddy-cop drama about two Bucharest officers fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way.
The lead roles - hard-boiled Gregor and idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, their dialogue dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some fine sight gags (the police pass the time watching chess on TV as Americans might football).
And the roster of famous voice-over actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of spot-the-voice.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the verisimilitude of a hamfisted propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like one.
At six long episodes, it drags, and the comedy isn't fast or frequent enough.
Edited to a tighter length, "Comrade Detective" might deliver better on its agitprop satire, as when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men wolfing down a pile of hamburgers.
The message, for the imagined communist audience, is that Western culture can turn anything into fodder to binge.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: We even do it with our own recent history, and theirs.
Russian athletes have not had their ban on starting lifted by the IAAF.
During its congress in London, the IAAF International Athletics Federation upheld the international ban preventing the Russian athletes from starting because of the state-sponsored doping programme.
The result vote regarding the world championships, which begin on Friday, was unambiguous, as expected.
The prolongation of the ban was approved by 166 delegates, with only 21 votes opposing it.
The main reason for the rejection is that Russia has failed to meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as noted by Rune Andersen, the head of the IAAF Special Investigation Group.
His group recommended that the ban be upheld.
Some older doping cases remain unresolved, as a number of suspected athletes have not yet been heard, and coaches with a compromised reputation are still working in the country.
The Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA is not yet fully operational, and does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
However, RUSADA may undergo testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
"Although progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done," said IAAF Chairman Sebastian Coe.
The Russian Athletic Federation was suspended in November 2015, meaning Russian athletes were not able to attend last year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban on the upcoming international championships, 19 Russians who have previously proved they have been tested outside of the Russian anti-doping system for a long time will participate.
However, they will not be able to start championships wearing the national colours, and in the event of a victory, the Russian anthem will not be played.
I would predict that within a short time most of them would find Thunderbird a satisfactory substitute for Chivas Regal and that their ``normal'' phobias, anxieties, depressions and substance abuse would increase dramatically.

Daughter says Ach!:
Probing the Space Between Form and Content Via Rewriting Anzia Yezierska as John Dos Pasos and Vice-Versa
Confronted with the task of comparing two modernist texts for the purpose of seeking a deeper understanding of both novels, I chose How I Found America by Anzia Yezierska and 1919 by John Dos Pasos, hoping that their marked divergence of styles would make for a compelling pair.
Their authors write so differently, in fact, I wondered what each of the texts would look like written in the style of the other.
Could their plots be translated without contradicting the narrative’s style?
Would common themes emerge or be obscured?
Having written Daughter’s last Character Story in Yezierska’s style and Dreams and Dollars in Dos Pasos’ style, my retrospective observations about the texts and my own act of writing has taught me that the each authors’ style serves their literary agendas.
Yezierska’s emotional, deeply internal narration contributes to her characters’ passions and tenacity to succeed, while Dos Pasos’ unsentimental, external narration estranges both the reader from the characters and the characters from one another, almost predicting their descent.
First, I wrote a part of Daughter’s last Character Story beginning on page 323 in the style of Yezierska.
I selected Daughter because, like Yezierska’s characters, she’s a young woman in an unfamiliar country, and I was struck by that similarity.
Furthermore, I was curious to see if I could render Daughter’s decision to kill herself and her ultimate death in Yezierska’s optimistic tone.
"My heart is broken!
Every hope I had is lost and I have nobody in this whole wide world!"
Daughter cried as she lay in bed.
Suddenly, through the open window blew the intoxicating scent of the cyclamens, those bright harbingers of love that Daughter had seen that day on the mountain in Rome and she thought of (5) Dick Savage.
Dick Savage!
How her very small, dark world had opened up the day she met him!
The way he spoke French and Italian so fluently, it was as if he were God sent to speak endless tongues on her behalf, to guide her in this strange city.
A wave of nausea ravished her and she closed her eyes, sucked down (10)again into that eternal spinning darkness.
Why did she always have to feel things so intensely?
Dick had held her to his breast, and her heart had beat so quick like the wings of birds as if to drive him back and escape, but she felt herself sink into lust for his kiss.
And now their child, burning with the furious intensity of new life and their love, grew within her and Dick did not want it!
(15) Daughter moaned and beat her fists against her own weak body.
"Why did I give in?" she wailed, "Why did I sacrifice what worldly good this mind could have done for something so base?"
She had wanted to become like Dick, to do something that would help the new world after the war.
Again she lifted her head to up and saw the bright sky outside her window.
To be a poet like (20) him!
To live anywhere, even on the cheapest sort of bread, filling the aching hunger in their souls with the beauty of their words!
But how could she tame the passion that choked her without Dick?
She needed someone to pull her up from her wretched condition.
Someone to support her and help care for their child if she wanted to spend her days at the desk with a (25) pen and not at the washtub with a scrub board, doing laundry to earn her keep.
"Unbearable!" Daughter shrieked.
"I didn’t travel to this country in this time of opportunity, everyone united under the auspices of a new world, to work with my hands!"
Communication of Appetitive Emotion in Rats:
Exploring the nature of 50KHz Ultrasonic Vocalizations
Introduction
From an evolutionary perspective, discrete emotions motivate organisms to act in adaptive ways in specific circumstances.
This function of emotions doesn't necessarily require communication.
Communication is inherently costly, since it requires specialized anatomical and neural architecture to produce and perceive signals, not to mention that producing signals itself uses energy.
Therefore, when emotions are communicated, there is likely to be some reason why natural selection favored this capability.
In the case of negative emotions, the functions of communication are fairly straightforward and well elaborated in the literature.
For example, take intra-species competition.
It is beneficial for strong organisms to be able to communicate anger and the intention to attack to weaker rivals, since doing so may in many cases preclude the necessity of actually engaging in a costly fight.
Conversely, weaker organisms are also well served to communicate their fear and intention to submit, if doing so will avoid a fight that they would have lost anyway.
Although emotion and communication thereof are often tightly linked, they are not inextricably so.
Emotions primarily serve to motivate behavior in evolutionarily adaptive ways; whereas communication also serves may other functions removed from emotion.
It is possible to imagine cases of emotion without communication; for example when emotional expression is suppressed, or an emotion is unconscious and therefore not expressed.
Likewise, many everyday instances of communication in human can be argued to be mostly or totally emotional content-free.
Adaptive Functions of the Communication of Positive Affectx
As is the case for many issues in emotions research, the communication of positive emotions is less well understood than similar topics surrounding negative emotions.
In this paper, I will consider the circumstances under which it might and might not be adaptive to communicate a particular type of positive emotion: appetitive motivation (sometimes called desire in humans).
Usually, one might expect that desire be a silent emotion, since its communication might cause others to seek the same desired reward, thereby necessitating sharing.
When rewards are large and sharing is not disadvantageous, or when social rewards are the objective, however, the advantages of communicating motivation might outweigh the costs.
Advantages of Communicating Appetitive Emotion
One type of situation in which communicating an appetitive state might be adaptive would be in initiating cooperation between conspecifics.
Cooperation is very useful in many spheres of animal life, with a common thread being that the outcome of cooperation is better for each cooperator than it would have been had the animals pursued the same goal alone.
In order to cooperate, however, the problem of the selfish interests of each participant must be addressed.
The ideal situation for an animal (Animal A) would be to fake intention to cooperate with Animal B, then cheat-thereby attaining the fruits of cooperation without the costs of actually doing one's part.
Therefore, natural selection will favor some honest signal of intention to cooperate to avoid these problems of potential cheaters.
One way of ensuring the honesty of affiliative signals would be to tie them to socially appetitive emotional states.
In this way, affiliative intentions would be ensured in those who signal affiliative intent.
Communication of appetitive emotion is also adaptive in other social situations.
For example, most animals communicate in the context of mating.
Although courtship behaviors are quite stereotyped in many animals, they can nonetheless be considered examples of communication of sexual motivation (or lack thereof), since they only occur in the context of mating attempts and have behavioral effects on their perceivers.
Another example of appetitive communication may be in play solicitations.

Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after lacklustre economic growth and easing inflation dampened speculation over a hike.
The Bank of England has warned economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it kept interest rates on hold amid a tightening squeeze on family incomes.
Policymakers on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with fewer members this month calling for a rise as lacklustre economic growth has weakened support for a hike.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its forecasts for growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and cautioned the squeeze on household incomes would continue, with inflation still expected to surge close to 3% in the autumn.
But it signalled rate hikes will be needed over the next few years to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation and said borrowing costs may need to rise by more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economy-boosting package unleashed a year ago in the aftermath of Brexit.
It will call time on the Term Funding Scheme to offer cheap-finance to banks from next February, although it said it was now expected to offer £15 billion more under the scheme - at £115 billion.
In minutes of the rates decision, the Bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains sluggish in the near-term as the squeeze on households' real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."
On rates, it reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and by a "somewhat greater" extent than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the Bank stressed that any hikes would be "gradual" and "limited."
The Bank's downgraded growth forecasts for this year and next compare with the 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
It maintained its forecast for growth of 1.8% in 2018.
Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro following the news.
The pound was 0.5% down at 1.31 US dollars and fell 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The no-change decision comes after recent disappointing growth figures have dampened mounting expectations of a hike, with GDP edging up to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
Growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to pick up slightly at the end of the year, according to the Bank.
Its latest inflation report offered little cheer for households being hit by soaring inflation and paltry pay rises as it said the squeeze will get worse before it gets better.
It added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" the hit to incomes over the next few years, but expects wages will recover "significantly" towards the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also set for a boost from surging demand for British goods thanks to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock EU referendum vote, which sent the pound slumping.
The Bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully feed through to prices and the economy.
Prior to the Bank's latest rates verdict, there had been growing clamour for a rate rise as inflation ramped up pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation eased back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the Bank said this was expected and will pick up once again over the coming months.
The Bank said the overshoot relative to its 2% target was "entirely" down to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market looks set to become ever more competitive once more as lenders clamour for business and look to end the year in positive fashion.

NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000
Patients will be able to access a 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September following a High Court battle over funding the drug on the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk individuals by around 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service through an initial three-year trial to an estimated 10,000 people.
It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year, which said the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite its claims that local authorities should fund it.
The move announced on Thursday was hailed as a 'major new intervention' by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a 'pivotal moment'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start enrolling people, with more clinics joining in October before full implementation across England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of getting HIV.
Trials have shown PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at-risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means there is just enough of certain drugs in a person's body to prevent an HIV infection taking hold.
Such drugs can be taken every day or as soon as two hours before having sex.
Those eligible for the treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and those with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully receiving treatment.
Clinics will identify eligible participants who consent to the trial, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti-retroviral treatment.
People living and registered with a GP in England will also be able to enrol for potential participation at their local participating sexual health clinic.
The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to source the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The trial is designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted, taken up, and implemented on a large scale.
Mr Stevens said: 'This major new intervention should complement and supercharge the wide-ranging and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV.
It's another milestone in more than three decades' worth of progress in tackling one of humanity's major health challenges.'
Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: 'This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if targeted properly at those in need and at risk, offers the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access via this NHS-funded trial in England to an empowering new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement.'
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'The priority must now be to make sure that the trial is rolled out speedily across the country, and that no-one at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP trial drug has been procured, we're well on the way to protecting over 10,000 people at risk of HIV.'
Shadow public health minister Sharon Hodgson said: 'The start of the PrEP trial is welcome and long overdue after months of delays and heel-dragging by the Government.
The evidence shows just how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this trial is rolled out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are exposed to HIV and help take us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.'
Outsourcing History On the Necessity of Stepping Out of the Archive
The popular image of the historian would be something like this: a solitary figure, the historian plies her craft in dark and dusty archives, rummaging among the documents of people long gone, aiming to discover their secrets.
As she leafs through the pages, she is drawn into the world of the past, and emerges triumphant, with a scholarly work to show for her efforts.
This, in turn, is read by few people, and matters to less.
This is the image that underscores the question I am so often asked about my studies: What is it good for, anyway?
It is against this false, simplifying image that I write.
In this rebellion I am inspired by the historians with whom this paper will deal, and who prove that history is nothing if not relevant.
Michel-Rolph Trouillot, Julia Thomas and the contributors to the volume Recasting Women all find different ways to break the divide between past and present; one of the ways they succeed in doing this, will be my claim, is by the use of sources which cannot traditionally be found in an archive.
Specifically, I will analyze Trouillot’s interactions with passers-by and tour guides, and his reflections on his own, personal history; the use of proverbs and songs by three writers in the Recasting Women volume, and finally, Thomas’ examination of a photography exhibit (the source I refer to here is the exhibit itself, and not the photographs that make it up).
By selecting to use these sources, I wish to argue, historians are making two claims.
First, that history and the past are very much things of the present.
By talking to people, walking around (physically and metaphorically) in the spaces in which the past is interwoven with the present, these authors are willingly giving up the objectivist, detached position.
The sources they use exist not simply as artifacts of the past, but in a lived, constantly evolving actuality.
The second claim relates to the production of knowledge: archives are a testimony of power.
By deciding what is kept for posterity and what is left behind, archives do not document the past but create it.
Archives assemble.
Their assembly work is not limited to a more or less passive act of collecting.
Rather, it is an active act of production that prepares facts for historical intelligibility.., they convey authority and set the rules for credibility and interdependence; they help select the stories that matter.
Finding a way to access sources that were not archived is an attempt to find cracks in past hegemonies.
Two disclaimers have to be made:
First, I am not calling for a privileging of non-archival sources over historical documents, or trying to devalue the role of archival research in the historian’s craft.
This is not a call for replacement, but for addition.
Archived documents must be analyzed – but if we seek a richer, more textured understanding of both past and present, we need to find methodologies that will supply glimpses into moments that did not make the archival cut, as it were.
Second, in analyzing these works, I will be looking at one very limited aspect – how and why certain types of sources are used.
I will not attempt a critical analysis of the works as a whole.
History begins with bodies and artifacts: living brains, fossil, texts, buildings
In Silencing the Past: Power and the Production of History, Michel-Rolph Trouillot is immersed in the present as he writes of the past; when he writes of family dinners, of his father and uncle, he is carrying out the following conviction:
The past does not exist independently from the present.
If the answers to these questions are affirmative, then institutional investors are likely to be favorably disposed toward a specific poison pill.

Life History Paper
Marie was born in Vietnam into an upper middle-class family.
Her father was a Vietnamese citizen of Chinese descent, while her mother was a French citizen of French and Vietnamese descent.
Marie is the oldest of seven children in her family and has three brothers and three sisters.
Now in her late forties, Marie was given a choice between the French or Vietnamese nationality when she collected her ID at the age of fifteen.
She chose to become a French citizen and left South Vietnam for France in 1973 when she was seventeen-years-old to stay with her maternal grandparents.
The rest of her family joined her two years later.
Marie then migrated to the United States when she was twenty-one with her parents and siblings, although she was to receive her citizenship only thirteen years later.
When Marie and her family first arrived in the United States, everyone in her family became permanent residents except for her as she was the only child in the family who was older than 21.
She was admitted on a one-month visitor's visa which was extended for more than a year.
Eventually, her application for permanent residency was rejected and she was to be deported back to France.
By then, Marie and her family had settled down in Jackson, Michigan, and opened a Vietnamese restaurant that firmly established them in the community.
Confiding in one of her regular customers of her immigration problems one day led to a successful campaign launched by her community in Jackson to allow her to stay.
In 1990, Marie finally received her American citizenship after an immigration saga that can be aptly described as harrowing.
Since then, the family-run restaurant has closed down and Marie has been working at a fast-food restaurant in the University of Michigan.
During her free time, she enjoys spending time with her nephew and nieces who often correct her English.
The interview with Marie illuminates several important theoretical concepts in the field of immigrant psychology, all linked to one another by the concept of identity.
Marie's thirteen-year immigration ordeal highlights the structural discrimination and subjectification that the immigrant experiences.
The incredible support from her community in Jackson provides a counter-point but also brings up the effects of social capital and the whitening process on the immigrant's negotiation of racial boundaries in the United States.
Marie's mixture of Chinese, Vietnamese, and French heritage also provides us with an interesting study of multiracial identities and how they are negotiated and reconciled.
Her choice of identity and affiliation at various stages in her life further sheds light on this negotiation.
Her gendered identity is also evoked as she traverses different cultural terrains.
The differential effects of psychosocial effects on her parents bring up gender differences in the impact of immigration.
Lastly, Marie's acculturation attitude which underlies the discussions on discrimination, identity and gender concludes the analysis.
Marie's fight for citizenship highlights the important concepts of discrimination and subjectification.
It was clear from the interview that Marie's fight for her citizenship was a defining and centralizing event in her life.
Her tone was emotional and her frustration apparent as she recounted the immigration court interpreter's negative portrayal of her to the judge and her futile attempts to correct her story:
Yes I hear and I told her not the way I say and she told me she has worked at immigration for a long time, and she translate, and I told her no, it's not right… but they don't let me talk, but the immigration judge don't let me talk, and they asked me where I came, and I say I came airport in New York.
But this lady interpreted to them, she told them I just hide to pass the immigration, like an illegal immigrant, like I hide, like I didn't go through immigration in New York.
Frog Island Community Garden: Giving Ypsilanti Food for Thought and Learning!
Proposed Funding Source: DTE Energy Foundation: L.E.A.D.
Grant Program
Abstract: The Frog Island Community Garden provides a site for community members to gather and grow food, with the objectives of improving community relationships and promoting food security within the city of Ypsilanti, Michigan.
To this end, we propose to expand the educational and environmental scope of the garden, by installing a demonstration bed and restoring an area of the adjacent Huron Riverbank to native prairie, and marking these areas with interpretive signs.
The enlarged garden area and signs will provide facilities and the necessary information for garden members and Ypsilanti residents to increase their understanding of the local ecosystem and participation in the local food system.
We request $8625 from the DTE Energy Corporation to complete the proposed installations.
Introduction and Literature Review
At Frog Island Community Garden in Ypsilanti, Michigan, community members are growing more than just vegetables.
Since their groundbreaking in the fall of 2006, they have been busily and passionately growing better health, food security, stronger relationships with fellow community members, and stronger relationships with their local natural environment.
When the garden’s founders, all members of the Ypsilanti Riverside Neighborhood Association, came together to start the garden on Frog Island, their initial goals were to supplement gardener diets with fresh, healthy, low-cost food while strengthening relationships with friends and neighbors at the same time.
In the city of Ypsilanti there are only two commercial sources of food: a small food cooperative and a newly opened Mexican grocery store.
In a city of 20,000 residents, many of whom are low-income, there is a call for greater availability of local, low-cost, healthy food.
Additionally, as in most urban settings in America, community members seldom meet each other and interact outside of their own personal sphere.
Frog Island Community Garden wanted to help address these needs that must be addressed for the existence of a sustainable, healthy community.
As the garden project at Frog Island began to develop, gardeners began to see the fruits (and vegetables!) of their labor before them and enthusiasm grew, not only amongst active gardeners in the garden, but also of Ypsilanti community members who would stop by the garden and ask about the new beautiful display of vegetables growing in the middle of their city on a previously plain expanse of grass.
With a new injection of energy, the garden’s founders began to expand their vision for the role Frog Island Community Garden could play in the local community.
What if this community garden could serve to educate the community about their connection to food, to the local natural environment, and about the role that these connections have to strengthening the community of Ypsilanti as a whole?
Given the state of environmental degradation occurring today at the global and local level, tying Frog Island’s gardening activities into environmental wellbeing seemed essential.
With excitement and conviction, Frog Island Community Garden has created an expanded mission to increase awareness among Ypsilanti community members through environmental education components of their garden regarding where food comes from and how it is grown so they can make responsible food choices that positively affect the natural environment, the local food economy, and themselves.
To this end, two additions to the garden are on the drawing table for implementation.
A demonstration garden plot will be added to the pre-existing garden plots where community members currently pay a monthly fee for room to grow vegetables of their choice.
This demonstration plot will highlight best practices of organic vegetable gardening including companion planting, square-food gardening, and natural pest control.
Interpretive signs will explain and elaborate on these topics and have a weatherproof container for free related educational material community members can take home with them.
Living the high life: mezzanine floor and clever design tricks have transformed this small Earls Court flat into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for doing up property, downsized from a large home in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is on the first floor of a smart Queen Anne terrace - and it is a testament to the new design that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and sold on.
"Before this, I was living with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," Joanne says.
"I was looking for something that was comparable for my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and put an offer in that day."
Since the first viewing, the 1,000sq ft flat has had a complete overhaul.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a convoluted layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement," she says.
To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to exploit the 12.5ft ceilings and create a home that wasn't only a development but a place for Joanne to live.
The ceiling wasn't quite tall enough to add two spaces on top of each other so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine that you could stand up in.
Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the brief.
"The steelwork is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the spaces so that they stacked on top of each other without needing to hunch down.
It wasn't just building a simple platform, but cranking the steels so that they were at the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to get two full-height rooms on top of each other in the space - with lots of added drama.
For the mezzanine, a vintage copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area below.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting all set the style for the scheme.
The use of mirrors plays a part in adding theatre, space and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it appear longer.
In the kitchen, the mirrored splashback feels like a window to another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide storage for all Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
Giving the perception of a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room is being able to close off the kitchen when it's not in use.
Foldaway kitchens are nothing new.
What's unique about this one is that it's a garage-style lift-up door.
"A bit of engineering went into that," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counter-weighted so that when you push the door up, it glides really easily."
Thanks to clever use of space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 16sq m, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, floor space is what you are going to sell - or how your property is valued," Erfan says.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will walk in and do a calculation based on floor size."
Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using quality materials that give the space its luxurious edge.
"The materials are the things that you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical feeds in the walls.
These are important but they don't pull the heart strings."
It goes to show that through good design and increased square metreage, a flat can turn from something standard into something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you may choose not to leave.

Rethinking Power and Class from Marx
The major characteristics of the Japanese employment system have been said to be seniority promotion and lifetime employment.
It used to be a common belief that a white-collar worker will work for one company for his entire life, from after he graduates from a university at the age of 21 with increasing pay as he gets older, until he retires at the age of 65 and receives his monthly pension from his company for the rest of his life.
However, the average life course of white-collar workers has been changing drastically since the collapse of the bubble economy in 1991 and the subsequent long-term recession for over 10 years.
Major Japanese corporations started abolishing various welfare benefits and their seniority promotion system-e.g.
SONY introduced the merit-based personal system in 2000.
People no longer think they will work for one company for their entire life, and the notion of changing jobs has become more common.
Advertisements on magazines, newspapers and fliers in trains and on streets persist in soliciting white-collar workers to get more educational certification to increase their market value in order to survive in the mobilizing employment market.
The popular certificates include TOEFL, TOEIC, accountant, tax accountant (CPTA), MBA, system administrator, among others.
Many white-collar workers have started going to career colleges at night after they return from their offices.
Aiming to promote the mobilization of the employment market, the Japanese government has started to support those workers who go to professional training schools by paying partial fees for schools.
Japanese white-collar workers do not think of themselves as workers -the term worker in Japan refers to manual laborers, and manual laborers are occupied by an increasing number of foreigners since late 1980s.
Rather, white-collar workers believe that they are freer laborers.
Those workers seem to welcome the breakdown of the traditional employment system, which forced them to be obedient to their companies, and the mobilizing employment market.
This is because the current shift in the employment system appears to them to indicate further freedom; they think We are no longer a cog in the machinery of the corporation.
We have different qualities as human beings, and our different personalities, skills, and abilities now are accounted for.
However, ironically enough, the white-collar workers' efforts to improve their qualifications means further alienation from their real personalities and further subordination to capitalism.
Indeed, [m]an is most completely a class determined being when least believe himself to be (Ollman 1976: 208).
My central questions of this paper are: Is class relation power relation?
If so, what are the source and the mechanism of power?
The secondary questions I will explore is how the docile people, now to the market, can be empowered as a revolutionary agent.
My answers to the main questions are: first, class is not just a category but a power relation; second, the logic of capital (Brown) allows the capitalist to be powerful, making all the others powerless; third, power is not what one can possess; as Sayer argues, power takes the guises of money, commodity, and capital, and the holders of those things -i.e. capitalists-indirectly exercise power over the powerless.
This paper will first analyze the notion of power in Marx, relying mainly on the arguments of Brown, Janmohamed, Ollman, Postone, and Paige.
In the second section, I will examine the relationship between class and power, mainly focusing on Wright, Sayer, and Portes, as well as Marx.
In the last section, I will discuss my rudimentary thoughts on how workers can retrieve their real personal life-i.e. species being-in the context of Japan.
The comparison with power relations in the pre-capitalist period helps to define the peculiarity of power relations in capitalism.
As the historical analysis of Perry Anderson shows, feudalism, a mode of production, is defined by an organic unity of economy and polity; a king percellized sovereignties and distributed those sovereignties to overlords.
In villages lords extracted economic surplus from surfs and exercised politico-legal coercion over them, and the lord in turn owed liege-loyalty and knight-service to his seigneurial overlord (Anderson [1974]1979: 19).
In feudalism when power relations were layered, kings, overlords, and lords possessed and exercised their power within territories in which economy and polity were congruent.
The United States are breaking apart.
The cultural and political divide between the blue and red states is widening.
California has declared a ban on its citizens traveling to Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee has hit back and has issued a retaliatory ban on its citizens traveling to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense, and US citizens can travel freely across all 50 states.
Rather, California has forbidden spending state money for its citizens to travel to eight other states, namely Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who will stop this madness?
California is strongly pro LGBT, and any disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle is seen as discrimination.
By contrast, Tennessee has issued an exception to the law stating that if a psychotherapist has a moral issue with treating patients from the LGBT community, they are not required to provide the therapy themselves and can find the patients another therapist who does not have a problem with it.
Texas and other states have in turn adopted laws under which religious charities that are given children for adoption by their mothers are not required to give these children to same-sex couples.
Because of these conscientious objection laws, California has placed a ban on funding its citizens' journeys to eight states from its own means.
In practice, this means that Californian professors are not allowed to travel to scientific symposiums in Texas with funding from their universities, for example, because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions in Tennessee, for example, with the financial support of their schools.
To fund the trips, they must either get federal grants, although it is absurd for the federal government to finance the travels of citizens from State A to State B, or else private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee has suffered and its parliament has passed a law with a resolution that it doesn't like the Californian policies of high taxes, high government spending, high deficits and tolerance of illegal immigrants, yet it will not place an embargo on travelling to California because of it.
It is placing the embargo as retaliation for the California embargo on Tennessee.
It will do the same to any state of the Union that orders a similar travel ban to another state, whatever the reason.
At the same time, it called on the parliaments of all the states to stop this madness.
The above is all fact, and now for a commentary.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of this is constitutional. No part of it is unconstitutional.
States have the right to enforce conscientious objection laws, as well as to decide what their money can be spent on and what it cannot.
Secondly, what's wrong with conscientious objection?
When a butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why couldn't they just offer beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why should they be forced to sell pork under penalty of punishment if there are already enough butchers offering pork?
In Colorado, one baker is facing an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a high fine because he refused to bake a cake for a homosexual wedding.
But he also refuses to bake cakes for Halloween or cakes that contain alcohol.
Why punish him and not just leave him alone and let the cakes be ordered from the hundreds of other bakers?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all federal citizens are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust their internal, domestic policies with non-federal powers, that is, according to the preferences of their inhabitants.
Then there are variety, multiplicity and diversity.
California can be California, and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California, and Texas and seven other states to also be California!
Fourthly, members of the LGBT community once legitimately fought for their lifestyle to be tolerated.
Today, many members of this community are guided by the rule of live and let live, which all reasonable people ought to follow, but some activists strive not for tolerance towards themselves and others, but for extreme intolerance towards others.
According to them, no one should ever show moral, religious or philosophical disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle, and if they do, they should be criminalised.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are the modern enemies of freedom.
Fifth, I do not know of any situation in US history when states have done this for political reasons except this case.
States did not even impose sanctions on one another in times of struggle for civil rights for black people, where the North and West were on the side of integration, and the South on the side of segregation.
The only case was the in 1950s, and the political cause was slavery, and the war by the North against the South.
Of course, nothing like that is happening now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political divide between the blue Democratic states and the red Republican states is widening, and the US is disconnecting internally on a mental level.
Perceptions of author based on text style in computer-mediated communication
1 Introduction
Throughout the history of language attitudes research, researchers have devised experimental techniques to investigate attitudes towards different forms of speech.
The linguistic object under examination usually pertains to spoken variation: different dialects, different degrees of nonstandardness of accent or fluency, different acoustic characteristics such as rate or pitch, and so forth.
Measures are taken of subjects' social judgments or evaluations of speakers with these different linguistic characteristics: what are the social attributes given to an accent or speech style, and what stereotypes or sociocultural facts contribute to those attributions?
Although a broad array of languages, dialects, and acoustic properties have bee investigated, there are components of linguistic practice underrepresented in the language attitudes literature.
Namely, very little work has taken written language as a site of variation and an area in which to explore perceptions of and attitudes toward difference.
In recent years, the proliferation of widespread text-based computer-mediated communication (CMC) has piqued the interest of scholars in the fields of communication, social psychology, and sociolinguistics.
However, the issue of how different textual features serve as social cues in online interpersonal communication has gone largely unexplored.
The present project will explore perceptions of speakers based on written variables, by replicating CMC messages and asking subjects about the person who has produced them.
With both quantitative and qualitative response components, the project is designed to enable an understanding of these attitudes as well as an indicator of possible topics for future investigation.
Because of the paucity of prior experimental research on this topic, the study is necessarily guided by a set of broad research questions, rather than specific hypotheses.
2 Background
Although there has been much research on CMC, experimental work is lacking on its sociolinguistic aspects.
The majority of CMC work has tried to understand how CMC compares to face-to-face communication, or how it compares to either spoken or written language.
Both of these streams of research are relevant to my goals, although the present project's aim differ from prior research in crucial ways.
Centered in communication-related fields, theorists have compared CMC to face-to-face communication, often arguing that CMC represents a medium bare of the nonverbal cues that provide social and contextual information in face-to-face interaction (for a good review and critique of this literature, see Walther 1993).
Sometimes it was argued that CMC's lack of cues would lead to inferior or socially unsatisfying communication, or that its text-based nature allowed CMC to act as a more anonymous and socially neutral form of communication.
Interestingly, CMC was said to lack precisely the features studied by language attitudes researchers (e.g., tone of voice, speech rate, prosody).
However, it has since been recognized that text itself does have nonverbal cues as well, but that they are of course different from those found in speech (Lea and Spears 1992).
Communicators will interpret some paralinguistic features as social cues, regardless of what modality they are communicating in (see Sierpe 2005).
This project seeks to understand how such cuing works in a text-based environment, and what components of text are likely to serve as cues to social identities.
Centered in more language-oriented fields, other investigations into CMC have focused on the relationship between speech and writing and how the two seemed to blur into one another online, often evinced by nonstandard features that are presumably the result of a more casual or conversational approach to online writing.
A number of features have been identified as being either present in or even stereotypical of online text: lack of standard punctuation and capitalization; in-text iconic graphical symbols, such as emoticons; shortened forms of words such as acronyms or abbreviations; phonetic and stylized spellings.
Illegal agitation.
A critic of Putin received a hefty fine.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny received a fine of 300 thousand roubles for violating campaign rules ahead of next year's presidential elections.
A court imposed a fine on him for calling on people to participate in unauthorised demonstrations.
Navalny has organised two large anti-government street protests over the past two months, and announced that he is setting his sights on the head of state position in March next year.
Current head of the Kremlin Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidacy, but he is generally expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said that the police came to his house in the morning and took him to court.
He was fined for calling people to demonstrations through videos on the YouTube internet portal.
The fine is 300 thousand.
"Later, we'll take it off the judge's salary," the Kremlin critic joked on Twitter.
The Russian electoral commission recently concluded that Navalny could not take part in the presidential elections because he was previously convicted of embezzlement.
However, Navalny, who is considered to be a fighter against corruption, believes the judgment to be politically motivated.
In addition to the 300,000 roubles, on Thursday the court also imposed fines 25,000 roubles on two members of Navalny's pre-election Team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became the dominant figured on the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend themselves against Naval any way they can.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year suspended sentence for stealing from the Kirovles forestry company.
The verdict was upheld by the Court of Appeals in May.
The ruling is so final that it prevents Navalny from nominating himself under Russian law.
The mediating effects of explanatory style:
Examining blood pressure, preventative health behaviors, and compliance with medical regimes in a diverse sample of hypertensive women.
INTRODUCTION
Essential hypertension (HTN) is a silent killer that affects 60 million adults in the United States causing arteriosclerosis, cerebrovascular accidents, myocardial infarctions, and end-stage renal disease (Hildreth&amp; Saunders, 1992).
The cause of hypertension is unknown (Williams, 1992) and current epidemiological studies indicate that it is more prevalent in African-Americans than all other racial groups (Burt et al., 1995).
Moreover, African-American women (AAW) have the greatest gender differential in the incidence of uncontrolled HTN (60% for AAW and 49% for Caucasian women).
HTN can be successfully controlled with prescription medication (Kaplan, 1995) and with the DASH diet (Appel, 1999; Appel et al., 1997; Sacks et al., 1995; Scisney-Matlock, Kachorek, Glazewski, in press).
Unfortunately, compliance with medical regimes is extremely difficult for at least half of all individuals with the diagnosis of HTN (Branche Jr., Batts, Dowdy, Field,&amp; Francis, 1991).
The purpose of this project was to examine how explanatory style (ES) predicts compliance with antihypertensive medication regimens and with other general health promoting behaviors in both African-American and Caucasian women.
Additionally, this paper will examine the link between ES and the central nervous system, specifically, blood pressure (BP) as it changes over time.
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
Attribution theory, first introduced by Fritz Heider (1958) and popularized by Jones and Davis (1965) and Kelley (1967, 1972), posits that people rationalize why events happen to themselves or others.
The function of this is to maintain a sort of psychological homeostasis.
When we realize that new information is incongruent with what we have come to accept and internalize through past experience, we try to interpret the events surrounding this information or condition in order to arrive at an appropriate explanation for what we're feeling (Schachter&amp; Singer, 1962).
Explanatory style, coined by Abramson et al.
(1978), and redefined by Peterson and Seligman (1984), is the verbal language people use when trying to mentally organize and make sense of (what Piaget would call assimilation) new information or a disturbing condition, such as chronic health problems like HTN.
ES can be broken down into two different styles, if you will -- pessimistic and optimistic.
These two ways of thinking about the world can be empirically measured via an assessment tool called the Attributional Style Questionnaire, or ASQ.
The ASQ has been used in numerous experimental studies (Seligman, Abramson, Semmel, and von Baeyer 1979; Peterson, Semmel, von Baeyer, Abramson, Metalsky, and Seligman 1982).
It is a means through which researchers can examine how people react to, behave in, and understand or interpret various hypothetical situations, ranging from failure on an academic test to being fired from a job.
It presents subjects with twelve events (6 bad and 6 good), in which they are asked to rate the cause of each event on a 7-point Lickert scale across three different dimensions.
The causes of events can be explained in 1) internal or external terms, as in I got second place in the race because I wasn't sufficiently trained to compete (internal cause for failure) versus, I got second place in the race because the wind was blowing very hard (external cause for failure).
Reasons for events can also be verbalized and internalized as 2) stable or unstable, as in Because I got second place this time, I will get second place in the next race too (failure and success are stable), versus, Although I got second place this time, that doesn't necessarily mean that is how I will do next time (failure and successes are unstable, or variable).
The last way events can be explained is through 3) global or specific terms.
Historical Places, Violent Spaces: A discussion on violence, personhood, and space in Virginia Woolf's Between the Acts
Virginia Woolf's last novel Between the Acts is, more than anything else, a comment on contemporary society and how individuals function within that structure.
She uses the house of the Olivers and the small-town pageant to provide a microcosm of the pressures and issues that existed in pre-World War II England.
Both the characters and the house, the main focuses of the novel, have their own history of class and culture and attempt to distinguish themselves among the influences and voices of the past.
Each character has a way of negotiating the pressures of the past; what the narration becomes is a portrait of people's acceptance of and resistance to their own individual chains of destiny—specifically regarding cycles of violence in history.
In Between the Acts, the concept of space acts as a vehicle through which a study of character formation and the difference between individual assertions of place and the ways that history, culture, and one's own past limit freedoms of self-assertion.
The concept of space is introduced through the form of the house at which the reader finds the main characters preparing for the annual pageant.
The house is described to belong to the Olivers who have only owned the house for a mere a hundred and twenty years.
The space is represented as having a history that predates the occupation by the current family, a fact which becomes important as the reader is further exposed to the idiosyncrasies of the Oliver house.
Attempting to create a meaningful history for the family and the house, the narrator leads the reader up the principle staircase…[to] a portrait…and ancestress of sorts (Woolf 7).
This image of a grand staircase leading up to a commanding matriarch immortalized in a portrait implies a rich and important past.
Most importantly, the reader is told that the butler had been a soldier…and, under a glass case there was a watch that had stopped a bullet on the field of Waterloo (Woolf 7).
The Oliver lineage is proven to be not only worthy of the house that predates their occupancy, but also worthy of the honor and respect that accompanies those who can be proven to be contributors to England's noble military history.
And as the description of space can impart notions of the importance of history and participation, it can also convey ideas about the issues of contemporary politics and the uncertainty of the importance of the individual.
As the reader crosses the threshold of the library along with the narrator, it is relayed that a foolish, flattering lady once declared that Books are the mirrors of the soul (Woolf 16).
But Isa enters the library, glances over the many books inhabiting the shelves, and realizes There they were, reflecting.
What?
What remedy was there for her at her age—the age of the century, thirty-nine—in books?
Book-shy she was, like the rest of her generation; and gun-shy too (Woolf 19).
There is a discordance between the space of the library and the woman who enters; Isa, in her modern, newspaper-dominated reality, does not truly belong in an environment dominated by Keats and Shelley.
Isa, along with her generation, is unable to harmoniously reconcile the traditions of the past with pull of the present.
The evolution of English culture that led to the importance of the newspaper also led to a hesitance to participate in world politics, referenced by the generation being gun-shy and supported by the contemporary resistance to entering the war by Britain.
Just as space can imply the idiosyncrasies of a generation, it can also suggest impressions of individual issues and emotions.

Brothers fight over $500 million property empire
Two brothers are at war over one of Victoria's biggest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a Toorak mansion three doors from younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court over how their property and business assets will be sliced up.
Paul has wanted out of the family business since 2014 but an acrimonious argument is playing out in the Supreme Court over the break-up.
Together with their mother Anna the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, amassed since the family bought a Smith Street, Collingwood, shop in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew it into a chain of 160 retail outlets.
It sold in 1999 for $85 million.
That money was sunk into property and the De Lutis portfolio now includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento development sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping centres.
Under an agreement with their late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the major driving force and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company assets and Paul about one-third.
A court filing says this translates to Colin owning property worth $316 million and Paul $176 million.
Dividing the properties and cash has proved the sticking point for Paul.
"The splits proposed by Colin left him with what I considered to be the best properties," he wrote in an initial court affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first Supreme Court hearing was held.
The brothers are also now fighting over who controls the existing business - which Paul alleges Colin has locked him out of.
Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some properties.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Costs are mounting in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports by companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer filed and top barristers including Allan Myers, QC, and senior solicitors retained by both sides.
Ms De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessens from the late 1950s and in the early 1970s bought a shop in Brunswick.
They used the collateral to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my final years of high school, when Paul was a young child (around 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass down their properties to their sons amicably.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin saying that Mark was paid $10 million when he left the business, and Luke $26 million.
Both Luke and Mark had become, Paul says, "bitter about the terms of their financial separation."
Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former AFL club board member and, according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the television star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis on Friday, and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied, by text message, to say that because the case was before the courts "I really cannot say much."
"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to sue me and drag our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in one court filing that he had tried to accommodate his brother's requests.
"Our father would not have wanted to see Paul and I end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he was "still hopeful of resolution."
On Friday, that hope appeared gone.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
2nd Reflective Teaching Assignment
Part 1a: Lesson Plan Analysis Task
Criterion #1: Eliciting Students' Ideas at the Beginning of the Lesson
It's been a week since we did the lesson on static electricity, so I want to remind students of what they learned about positive and negative charges.
I want to make sure they are about to connect this lesson to prior information, which will help them organize the information in their head and make a more accurate scientific model.
Without first discussing static electricity and their ideas about lightning, students may be confused about the purpose of the lesson and how to start constructing their scientific models.
I think discussing last week's lesson and their ideas about lightning will be a good lead in to the activity today.
At the beginning of the lesson, does the lesson enable the teacher to elicit students' ideas about the new content?
The original lesson taught static electricity and lightning in the same lesson.
At the very beginning of the lesson, the teacher is supposed to 'review with your students what they know about cloud formation, thunder and lightning storms.'
Since I am doing the lightning lesson separate from the static electricity lesson, I also want to review our last lesson and example of static electricity they thought of.
Does the lesson ask student to make predictions and give explanations for their ideas?
No, the lesson plan does not ask students to make predications – the students actually do very little work with the concept of lightning in the original lesson plan.
The teacher is supposed to read a provided explanation of lightning and there is no opportunity for students to discuss how lightning is connected to static electricity before the teacher is supposed to provide them with an explanation.
After eliciting students' ideas, we are going to have students draw a diagram of how lightning forms and explain their drawing in sentence form.
Does the lesson provide opportunities for students’ ideas and prediction to be recorded and shared with others?
Again, no.
After students have filled out the predication section of their worksheet, we will have them share with a partner.
I will be walking around the room asking students to explain their diagrams and I will also ask a few students to share with the whole class before starting the movie.
Criterion #2: Promoting Students' Sense Making
I want students to draw conclusions and formulate their own explanations about lightning from watching a video instead of just watching without really processing it.
I don't want them to use my language or the language of the video, but language and concepts that they are familiar with and that makes sense to them.
However, there are some terms and processes that they need to understand and be able to use (like electrons or the charge coming up from the ground) in order to fully explain the formation of lightning.
Does the lesson provide students with the vocabulary to explain their findings?
The explanation provided in the original lesson has the teacher using some of the terminology, but the students don’t necessarily use it unless the teacher has students engage in a discussion about the phases in the life of a lightning bolt.
Mandy and I are going to review the terms we covered last week and introduce some important new words.
We are also going to have the students collectively decide what elements should be represented in everyone’s model, so some of the vocabulary should come up then (electrons, positive discharge from the ground, etc).
Students also have to explain their final model in sentence forms, giving them another chance to use the vocabulary.
Are students asked to explain the phenomenon in their own words?
The original lesson plan provides a list of discussion questions, but doesn't explain how to implement them.
Lazy pronunciation and the ideologies of Cantonese standardization
Many Hong Kong Cantonese speakers have heard of the term lazy pronunciation either from schools or from public discourse with reference to the ways in which certain words are pronounced in a colloquial way instead of in accordance with Cantonese dictionary prescription.
For example, the second person pronoun you, when pronounced as [lei2]1 instead of the dictionary form [nei2], is considered lazy, and thus the speaker who uses this form is said of being lazy as well.
Some Cantonese speakers may be able to identify and demonstrate a few specific words of the lazy category, but there are many who do not perceive a difference between a lazy variant and a dictionary form.
It is a phenomenon exists among Cantonese speakers for at least 120 years (Ball 1883, reprinted 1924: LXIII) although many Cantonese scholars (Zhan 1990, Li 1995, Ho 1989, etc.) believe that it only occurs very recently.
Prescriptivists claim that using the lazy variants hinder communication, because in some cases the lazy variant becomes a homophone of another word with a different lexical/referential meaning.
In actual usage, however, miscommunication seldom happens when these variants are used in context.
In other parts of the world, it is common that certain speech forms or dialects are labeled bad, slovenly or lazy, as opposed to other forms which are labeled good.
Andersson and Trudgill (1990: 129) comment on h -dropping in British English noting that many complainers claim that dropping the initial h sound is slovenly, careless, lazy, and wrong.
They counter this accusation by noting the example of knee and know : No one would want to claim that it is lazy to drop the k in knee and know.
You have to drop the k in modern English - you would be thought very funny if you didn't - although until about 400 years ago it was pronounced by all speakers.
And if k -dropping is not 'lazy', then h -dropping cannot be lazy either (ibid.:131).
Aitchison (1996: 19) comments on reactions to her series of Reith lectures on language that were broadcast by the BBC in Britain.
She quotes a response she received by letter:
The speech patterns you endorse are the direct result of downright bone idleness in the speech of the cockneys.
In response, Aitchison uses basic phonetics to point out that the most noticeable cockney speech feature, the glottal stop, requires considerable muscular tension, and could not be due to laziness (ibid.: 19).
The case of Received Pronunciation (RP) vs.
Cockney has economic and social-class underpinnings.
RP is considered a prestige form as it is the variety that has the highest value in the standard linguistic market in Britain.
The use of marked RP features or Cockney features, then, become indexical to the speakers and their respective social and economic status.
The indexicality of the prestigious form is further associated with other culturally defined values such as aesthetics and excellency.
A comparable but different case in the US about language standard and standardization is discussed by Silverstein (1996), in which political economy is linked with folk ideas about language which has a consequence on how personhood and nation are constituted in America.
The two places, Britain and America, have a few commonalities.
First, both societies have a respective single variety of English that is more preferred than other regional and social dialects of English.
Second, in both societies English is more preferred than other languages.
The Hong Kong case is different because of a different societal preference for language use.
The Portrayal of Menstruation in Ulysses:
Commentary on Sensationalism, Confinement, Realism and Intimacy
Throughout James Joyce's Ulysses, the protagonist, Leopold Bloom confronts and questions depictions of the idealized female form.
For example, in one episode he investigates whether or not the statues of nude goddesses at Dublin's National Gallery have all the same orifices that he does.
This episode, referenced repeatedly throughout the text, is just one of many attempts to complicate idealization and a culture that neglects to address the totality of the body through frank explorations of bodily realities.
One such bodily reality, menstruation, offers a particular form of commentary because of its intimate ties to femininity.
The depictions of menstruation throughout the novel are wildly different, from the stifled portrayal of Gerty Macdowell in Nausica, to Gerty's sensational act of exposing her bloody clout in the hallucinatory Circe, to Molly Bloom's frank, realistic frustration in Penelope.
But in their own way, all portrayals ironize traditional constructions of femininity, and ask a reader to critically consider a culture that promotes gendered behavior but dismisses bodily realities of sexual difference.
Before we can assess the significance of Gerty's shocking reappearance in Circe, we must first investigate the ways in which Gerty's narrative treatment in Nausica necessitates this type of subversive addendum.
In other words, what violence justifies and provokes such sensational resistance?
An analysis of the prose style provides insight.
Unlike Joyce's intimate portrayals of Leopold Bloom and Molly Bloom as narrated in the first-person, Gerty is narrated in the third person – a style that emphasizes, as opposed to minimizes, distance between reader and character.
The third-person narration may also reflect juvenile, self-narrated fantasies of self-importance, suggesting that this is the language of dishonest engagements as opposed to frank confrontations with reality.
In this same vein, the prose style also actively suppresses or stifles anything popularly deemed ugly, vulgar or emotionally wild.
This suspicious stylistic practice is introduced from the outset of the chapter.
The second sentence of the opening paragraph reads, Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old Howth… (284).
The sentimental phrase all too fleeting day, simply negates the realities of Bloom's torturous day thus far in a wash of inappropriate cliché.
The narrative style's immediate suppression of pain and struggle sets the tone for the chapter.
Similarly, though the line, From everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled (299) refers to Gerty, this sentence can also be read as a lens through which to interpret the narrative style.
For example, a reader can't help but note the abundance of euphemisms – the outhouse is that place (291), menstruation is that thing (296), and even an article as benign as a toddler's unsoiled diaper is referred to as his unmentionables (285).
Indeed, when the content of the narrative even borders on vulgarity, the prose reasserts its control and overcompensates stylistically with euphemism after euphemism.
More disturbingly, the prose style also stifles ugly emotional realities.
For example, Gerty's painful account of her father's alcoholism is diffused by prose language that inappropriately sentimentalizes Gerty's situation.
For example, the text explains But the vile decoction which has ruined so many heaths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days.
Nay, she had even witness in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and has seen her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely… (290).
The content of this narrative is truly painful, but the manner in which it is presented doesn't adequately recognize or address that pain; words like nay and vile decoction are too precious and distractingly exotic to truly capture the ugliness of the situation.
By this point in the novel, a careful reader should realize that this chapter's half-hearted engagement with emotion and the body is suspicious.

Management Plan
Bipolar disorder (BD) occurs in about 1-4% of the population (Sachs, Huffman,&amp; Stern, 2004).
However, many clients are underdiagnosed and untreated.
As a result, 15-25% of untreated bipolar clients die from suicide and untreated bipolar female clients experience a decrease in life expectancy of 9 years (Sachs et al., 2004).
In addition, the acute episodes are associated with highly risky behaviors that lead to other complications (e.g. substance abuse, violence, suicide, etc.)
(Sachs et al., 2004).
Depending on the client's stage of illness, the treatment is varied.
Regardless, the general approach is to assess the client's baseline medical and psychological status, eliminate mood-elevating agents, encourage good mood hygiene, and provide mood-stabilizing medications (Sachs et al., 2004).
Lithium and divalproex are first line mood stabilizing agents while antipsychotics in conjunction with lithium and divalproex are useful for acute episodes of psychotic mania or severe mania (Sachs et al., 2004).
Although pharmacological management has been the mainstay treatment for BD, recent evidence indicates that pharmacotherapy is not completely effective in treating BD (Gonzalez-Pinto et al., 2004).
With recent advances in psychotherapy, many practitioners are now using a combination treatment approach of pharmacology and psychotherapy to manage BD clients (Gonzalez-Pinto et al., 2004).
One form of psychotherapy is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).
CBT has been commonly used and shown to be an effective intervention for treating unipolar depression (Patelis-Siotis, 2001).
Among the different types of psychotherapeutics, the unique characteristics of CBT allow it to be a helpful adjunct treatment of BD.
Within CBT management, psychoeducation regarding BD is included.
This promotes monitoring and self-regulation of the disorder (Patelis-Siotis, 2001).
Studies have shown the effectiveness of CBT in relapse prevention of clients with unipolar depression which suggests that CBT may be helpful for preventing relapse in BD clients (Patelis-Siotis, 2001).
Since BD is always recurrent, relapse prevention needs to be emphasized (Sachs et al., 2004).
With reports of over 50% of BD clients being noncompliant with their pharmacology regimen, the use of CBT has been shown to increase compliance with the medication treatment (Patelis-Siotis, 2001).
Finally, preliminary studies are showing that the combination of cognitive style and stressful life events are predictors of depressive symptoms in BD (Patelis-Siotis, 2001).
Given that cognitive styles are similar between unipolar depression and BD, this also strengthens the usefulness of CBT in managing BD (Patelis-Siotis, 2001).
CBT is based on the Cognitive Model of Emotional Response Model (National Association of Cognitive Behavioral Therapists, 2004).
Basically, the model assumes that people's thoughts affect the way they behave and feel and not their situations (National et al., 2004).
Therefore, if individuals learn how to control their thoughts, despite their circumstances, they can change their negative thought process to a positive thought pattern (NACBT, 2004).
This change in the thought process leads to improved emotions and behavioral patterns.
CBT combines two forms of psychotherapy, cognitive and behavioral therapy.
The cognitive therapy identifies faulty spontaneous thought patterns that occur throughout the day that lead to negative emotions and actions (Samson, 2001).
By identifying these automatic thoughts, the therapist has an idea of the underlying assumptions and beliefs about the client's worldview (Samson, 2001).
Heatwave in the Czech Republic.
Teachers hose down children.
Public transport drivers carry water and wear summer clothes.
The 35 children who attend the Na Chodovci kindergarten in Prague 4 are only able to go outside in the morning.
The school has just been renovated and the recently planted trees do not provide much shade yet.
There is no pool there, but the teachers cool children down with a sprinkler.
In the afternoon, the children stay in the classroom, where the blinds and curtains are drawn.
They also try to cool down the air with a purifier as they do not have air conditioning.
It is challenging for both the teachers and the cooks.
"The indoor and outdoor temperatures exceed the hygienic limits for kindergartens, so we should not really have been operating at that time," said Miloslava Makovičková, the school director.
There is a glass corridor in the nursery where the temperature reaches around 40 degrees.
We ventilate in the morning around 6:00. We close the windows and we have blinds on the southern sides that protect us.
"But it doesn't help much," she added.
There are better conditions at the Na Hrázi forest kindergarten in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outdoors.
We have fully grown trees on the land, so we can stay underneath them.
"We have a beautiful walnut tree with a table under it, and we do different things there," said Barbora Kompanová, the director of the kindergarten.
Teachers try to go into the woods with the kids, where there is a more shade.
The children wear damp caps and there are various kinds of water sports on the schedule.
"We have a hand-operated sprinkler that is used for spraying flowers, and we use it for showering the children," said Kompanová.
Jitka Vilimovská, the headmaster of the nursery school in Novoborská ulice in the Prosek area of Prague, said that teachers are trying to keep the children in the shade and sprinkle them with water.
"We have a fairly developed garden, so they can stay under the trees," she said.
The go outside in the morning and then after 15:00.
Every child must have something covering their head.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
For example, they can choose between slightly sweetened tea or diluted juice, and they drink water in the garden.
They also eat green salad every day, and their snacks always include fresh fruits and vegetables, which sometimes brought by their parents.
"For example, one mum brought about a ten-kilo melon for the kids today," Makovičková added.
Drivers receive water or a summer uniform.
The DPP transport company in Prague is providing them with water, ionised drinks or summer uniforms on hot days.
The tram and bus drivers' cabins are air conditioned in most cases, said DPP spokeswoman Aneta Řehková.
In addition to the cabins, the passenger compartments of some trams are also air conditioned.
The tram tracks have not been seriously damaged by the high-temperatures.
Small damage occurred in a circuit in Hostivař.
At the current high temperatures, we must pay particular attention to make sure that a sufficient number of drinks are available to the drivers.
"Chilled drinking water is available on all routes, exchange points and depots," said Řehková.
At some depots and exchange points, workers also have access to so-called "sodobars", which dispense cold soda.
Drivers also receive soluble ionic beverages as a preventive measure.
"They can also wear a summer uniform, which makes drivers more comfortable during their daily shifts," the spokesperson added.
The hot, dry weather of the past few days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters throughout the Czech Republic extinguished 108, which is twice the daily average.
During the day on Tuesday, when temperatures in the Czech Republic climbed above 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters were mainly engaged in putting out fires.
"There are an especially high number of fires in the natural environment, which are associated with wildlife," said firefighter spokesperson Nicole Zaoralová.
The firefighters were not even brought any relief evening by the changes in the weather in the evening, as in many places the heat was replaced by storms and torrential rain.
Firefighters attended to 236 incidents in connection with thunderstorms.
In particular, many of the calls required them to remove fallen trees and branches.
"Central Bohemian region was most affected," Zaoralová continued.
However, the help of firefighters was also required in Stvolinek, Česká Lípa, where 60 people from the children's camp had to be evacuated to safety because of the storm.
The tropical temperatures also created work for rescuers in Prague.
On Tuesday and on Wednesday night, ambulances were called out to dozens of cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from boilers.
As such, people should have their water heaters checked, rescue services warned.
Carbon monoxide is a colourless, odourless gas that is released through incomplete combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headaches and fainting.
In case of suspected poisoning, you should leave the affected room.
Cholera seasonality, rainfall, and fadeouts: a geostatistical approach
Abstract:
The seasonality of cholera and its spatial variability remain unexplained.
Uncovering the role of environmental drivers in these seasonal patterns is critical for understanding temporal variability over longer time scales, including trends and variability between years.
Rainfall has been proposed as a key driver of the seasonality of cholera.
To address this hypothesis, we examine the association between rainfall and cholera is both time and space.
We show that historical data for the districts of former British India (1900-1940) cluster into two main regions that differ not just in the effect of rainfall but also in their seasonal pattern and frequency of fadeouts.
Results support a previously proposed model of cholera seasonality with two different routes of transmission and a dual nature of rainfall, with both positive and negative effects.
We define "endemic" and "epidemic" cholera regions based on these findings.
Introduction
The seasonality of cholera remains a mystery, it exhibits robust regularity but with important geographic variation.
Furthermore, its environmental drivers are poorly defined because the seasonal pattern varies in space, with different lags relative to rainfall, one major potential driver.
For example, two peaks per year are the typical pattern described for cholera in Bangladesh and former Bengal, with a decline in the summer during the monsoons, but only one peak is present in other regions of former British India and current Brazil, which coincides with the rainy season (see review by Pascual et al., 2002; and Codeço, 2001).
A better understanding of cholera's seasonality is key to identify the regional mechanisms behind the described effect of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (Pascual et al., 2000; Koelle and Pascual, 2004).
It is also fundamental to build scenarios for cholera with global change.
Both climate variability (ENSO) and climate change are likely to act on infectious diseases through the modulation of the seasonal cycle and the crossing of environmental thresholds (Pascual and Dobson, 2005).
Studies in volunteers confirmed that the ingestion of a dosage between 107 and 1011 bacteria, depending on the method (for example, neutralizing stomach acidity, or with different foods), develop in an infection (Kaper et al., 1995); consequently, bacteria density is considered a major indicator of potential outbreaks.
Moreover, the existence of two possible routes of transmission for cholera includes rainfall in the seasonal cycle of cholera cases.
Primary transmission presumably occurs from a reservoir of the pathogen Vibrio cholerae in the aquatic environment.
Brackish water and estuaries, has been shown to provide adequate environmental conditions for the bacterium to survive outside the human host (Colwell et al., 1977).
Secondary or human-to-human transmission occurs via the ingestion of fecally contaminated water, and some times through food (Glass et al., 1991).
The relative importance of these two routes of transmission is highly debated; however, if a strong feedback exists from infected hosts to the natural environments, the distinction between the two is blurred.
Based on these two transmission routes, Dobson et al. (in prep.) have previously proposed the following mechanisms behind the bimodal seasonal pattern of cholera in Bangladesh.
The first peak occurs in the spring, during the dry season when temperature warms up, because the bacterium thrives in the environment where it is also more highly concentrated, and humans' interaction with water bodies increases (i.e. primary transmission).
The monsoon leads to a decline in cholera in the summer, as heavy rainfall dilutes the concentration of the pathogen in the environment and both salinity and pH, favorable conditions for the bacteria, decay.
This dilution effect of rainfall represents a negative influence.
However, a positive effect would follow with an increase in cholera as humans concentrate in the flooded landscape and existing sanitary conditions break down (i.e. secondary transmission).
This seasonal model provides predictions for both endemic and epidemic areas.
In endemic regions, cholera should exhibit a negative association with rainfall at zero lag (dilution effect) and a positive correlation at positive lags reflecting the increase in secondary transmission after the rains.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media diet.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even keel.
Here's a bit from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly huddled with senior staff on his first day at work, he outlined a key problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he planned to fix: bad information getting into the president's hands.
Kelly told the staff that information needed to flow through him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if given good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes perfect sense, but others have tried and failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his TV-watching habit is still going strong.
"If candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from outlets that were persuadable," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is laughable.
Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't - that Trump's tweets would have been even more inflammatory if not for their interventions.
We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his staffers managed to him out of trouble even a few times, then their efforts were worthwhile.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from stirring up controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House composed of competing factions, people invariably try to advance their agendas by presenting Trump with material - which may or may not be reliable - that promotes their worldviews.
Politico - all over this story - reported in May on advisers' penchants for strategically feeding dubious information to the president.
This was one example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say Trump can react volcanically to negative press clips, especially those with damaging leaks, becoming engrossed in finding out where they originated.
That is what happened in late February when someone mischievously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being 'the source behind a bunch of leaks' in the White House.
No matter that Johnson had been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he offered no concrete evidence or that he had lobbed false accusations in the past and recanted them.
Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."
How'd that work out?
Kelly is trying to do the same thing, three months later.
Perhaps he will prove a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his aides are still vying for influence.
Those immutable factors will make Kelly's mission very difficult.

On Question Operators in Chinese Wh-multiple Questions
1.Setting the Stage
We think it is universal that a direct wh-question sentence should have a C0 looking for [+Qu] feature 1.
This [Spec,CP] is filled in overt syntax by the wh-phrase in English but not in Chinese.
Chinese Wh-elements are very different from English Wh-elements, Chinese wh-elements do not necessarily carry a [+Qu] feature, they need to be merged with a wh-direct question feature to be like an English Wh-element.
Study on Chinese wh-in-situ abounds in literature, but wh-elements in Chinese multiple questions have not been extensively discussed.
One reason is that in Chinese multiple wh-sentences, wh-elements are not inherently interrogative.
The other reason is that people have the thinking that multiple questions in Chinese could be highly manipulated by contextual discourse and is syntactically elusive.
But our thinking is that it is true that sometimes highly discourse-linked multiple questions could go beyond the reach of syntax, but generally we have no much trouble to agree on what is a sentential question and what is a contextual question.
Based on previous crucial proposals about question operator in literature, our paper will argue for the existence of a question operator base-generated with the insertion of the associate interrogative wh-element in Chinese in the DS.
We will propose that the question operator is a stripped-off wh-question feature with null PF convergence.
The paper also points out that this question operator, although operates at SS, is in spirit very close to feature movement.
In the light of our base-generated question operator, we will look at the effect of several main constraints for English wh movement in Chinese multiple questions to see whether or not they extend to Chinese question operator movement.
2. The crucially relevant proposals in previous literature
2.1 Baker's proposal of the existence of the abstract Q morpheme in English:
The notion of morpheme Q goes back to Katz and Postal, they proposed an Sentence-initial morpheme Q and interpreted it as a performative, having a reading which is abbreviated roughly as I request that you answer.
Baker's 1970 paper about Question Morpheme proposed a revised Clause-initial Q morpheme which he suggests is contained in both direct questions and indirect questions.
There were two versions of arguments concerning the mechanism of the abstract Q morpheme pointed out in Baker's paper:
One involves the morpheme in a movement rule which moved the question constituent to a position adjacent to the Q morpheme(Baker 1970).
The other involves it in a movement rule in which the questioned constituent actually replaces the Q morpheme which could be quoted as Replacement Rule (Jacobs and Rosenbaum, 1968).
Both of these two proposals do not assume any movement of the Q morpheme.
The Replacement Rule is said to be offering a beautiful explanation for the fact that there could only be one moved questioned constituent.
Since once the replacement is done, there is no Q morpheme there that could be replaced.
We think this analysis is in spirit very close to the feature checking in Minimalism Theory which claims that once the feature is checked, there should be no further movement.
Baker provided three trees to demonstrated how the Clause-initial Q morpheme works to account for the two readings of the following sentence 4
The first tree fails to account for the two readings.
The second tree has the reading with the answer John and Martha remember where we bought which book.
The third tree has the reading with the answer John remembers where we bought the physics book and Martha and Ted remember where we bought The Wizard of Oz.
In the lower two trees, the Q operator binds different underlying noun phrases in the portion of the tree which it commands):
Who remember where we bought which book?

The Electoral Micro-Macroeconomic Cycle:
Taking Tufte to the State Level
Introduction
Citizens of democratic governments wield a tool by which they can send a signal to their elected officials.
Through voting these citizens can reward elected officials by reelecting them into office, or they may also signal discontent and vote them out of office.
This accountability mechanism places emphasis on the performance their representatives.
As a result, the politician should respond by attempting to enhance performance, or at least enhance perceived performance in order to win the election.
A way to achieve this end is through the provision of public goods.
One such public good includes favorable macroeconomic conditions.
For example, the president of the United States has the available instruments, like transfer payments, public spending, and tax policies, to try to influence the economy in a positive direction.
If he or she can successfully stimulate economic conditions, voters will likely reward the incumbent for their performance.
With that said, attempts to stimulate the economy to capture votes should increase in the months leading up to an election.
Scholars and academics have explored this idea and have actually observed this trend of pre-election economic expansions (Tufte 1978; Nordhaus 1975), labeling it the political business cycle.
Edward Tufte found a pronounced relationship between presidential election cycles and economic boosts.
This is an interesting model that can be pushed further empirically.
In March 2006, Jennifer Granholm the governor of Michigan signed into law an increase in the minimum wage.
This legislation was set to take effect October 2006, exactly a month before the gubernatorial election.
It could have been altruistic, but the timing is suspect.
It is my conjecture that other governors engage in the same sort of opportunistic behavior.
Governors have the same incentives as presidents, and Tutfe's political business cycle model should extend empirically onto these sub-national elections.
Literature Review
First, it would be prudent to consider the academic literature on the political business cycle.
Scholars have continuously revisited the topic since it was first posited in the 1970s.
One of the early pioneers of this theory was Edward Tufte, as mentioned before.
In his seminal work Political Control of the Economy, Tufte found that out of 27 democratic countries, 19 showed evidence for an electoral-economic cycle (1978).
This meant that 19 of 27 countries showed economic acceleration in the months leading up to the election.
The United States, in particular, exhibited increased short-run growth in the run up to elections as opposed to drop down in the non-election years for the majority of post-WWII presidencies (Tufte 1978).
As time went on, an alternative theory arose; some academics moved towards the partisan theory.
Unlike the political business cycle, the partisan theory suggests that different parties will implement policies that appease to their base constituencies.
Parties of the left often represent the working class.
Thus, they will pursue policies that decrease unemployment since effects of unemployment fall disproportionately on lower income workers (Hibbs 1987).
Parties on the right, on the other hand, tend to minimize inflation, because they typically represent the upper income populace.
More support for the political business cycle came in 1995.
Improving on the model Kenneth Schultz (1995) observed a pronounced, and at times sizable, trend of expansionary policies in the pre-election months.
His improvement included controlling for the political incentives to manipulate at election time, which previous works did not take into account.
As a result previous studies displayed a higher level of variance in the data supporting this model; however, controlling this variable revealed robust evidence in favor of Tufte's theory (Schultz 1995).
Douglas Hibbs, a proponent of the partisan theory, even admits to empirical evidence in favor of the political business cycle.
Travellers negotiate trench, return to 'Millionaire's row'
Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are again at loggerheads with determined travellers who have negotiated a council-dug trench to reclaim a field outside their mansions.
The travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull dubbed 'millionaire's row'.
Bringing horses, babies and an army of vans, they have returned after being kicked out only in May, undeterred by a moat dug by the council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defences, squeezing their vehicles though a section left unbarricaded to accommodate a pathway.
Furious residents have savaged Solihull Council saying it was 'useless at dealing with the problem'.
One anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday night after being moved on from Bentley Heath where they were throwing rocks at passers by.
The council needs to be shamed into action as they are useless at dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, were moved on and now they are back again.
More arrived last night, probably even more today.'
She added: 'Birmingham council knows how to deal with this by getting long injunctions to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook road and I'm not happy to continue paying my council tax when the council can't even stop this.'
One local resident who did not wish to be named said: 'It is ridiculous, we have only just seen the last round of these travellers leaving, only to be blighted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and a horse has even been seen grazing on the parkland.'
A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: 'We are aware of an unauthorised encampment on land off Streetsbrook Road and working alongside Solihull Police, we are undertaking the necessary legal actions to move them on as quickly as possible.
To support our evidence gathering it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps build a picture of the situation for the court to consider when we present our case to them.'

Introduction/Lit Review/Research Design
Introduction
In my research, I will be attempting to answer the following question: what impact, if any, did the rise of political activity on the Internet have on Democratic victories in the midterm elections of 2006?
And, if it did, how can this impact be understood in terms of new means of political participation?
In the objective analysis of the election, I will be focusing on the impact of left-wing political websites in fundraising and voter mobilization in various Senate and House races.
In my explanation of this potential phenomenon, I will attempt to understand political participation over the Internet in terms of three major concepts: individually-motivated participation, externally-motivated participation, and modern developments in information dissemination and participation (social epidemiology, participatory and collaborative websites, etc.).
Few could doubt the rising impact of the Internet on all aspects of our lives.
It makes sense then, that the realm of politics is not exempt from this transformation.
Over the past few election cycles, a class of political websites, or blogs, has emerged as a powerful force in American politics.
Through fundraising and ground work, Daily Kos, the pre-eminent left-wing political blog, single-handedly guided an unknown, Ned Lamont, to a victory over the incumbent, Sen.

The list of successful candidates who found their start on Daily Kos includes Senators Jon Tester and Jim Webb, and Representatives Tim Walz, Jerry McNerney, and Joe Sestak, among others.
Were the Netroots, the left-wing blogosphere, the driving movement behind the Democratic resurgence of 2006, or were they simply in the right place at the right time?
The answer to this question will likely enlighten us to the future role of the Internet in politics.
The nature of this role will dictate change on a number of fronts in American electoral politics: common qualities of successful candidates, strategies and effectiveness of political campaigns, accountability of politicians (both within their local constituency and to the national party), and regulatory campaign law.
Thus, my inquiry addresses the future of politics in the light of new technological development.
As communication grows ever faster and more comprehensive, the American political system will undergo great change.
An examination of our most recent elections may shed some light on how that great change will manifest itself.
Review of the Literature
There has been some scholarship on the Internet and its effect on political participation, but little has been written specifically about the effect of blogs.
As these blogs grow in influence and number, it will become increasingly necessary to account for their existence in any comprehensive examination of political participation.
Assessing their current level of influence and investigating how they fit into the larger context of political participation literature is a good and necessary first step in incorporating them fully into our academic understanding of politics.
In this review, I will begin by summarizing the classical view of political participation, without reference to the impact of the Internet.
Next, I will examine the more recent scholarship on the impact of the Internet on participation theory, in particular examining the radically changed cost/benefit model for individual participation and the potential for change in direct and indirect mobilization.
I will also attempt to reconcile the work of one particular thinker, Malcolm Gladwell, with both traditional participation theory and newer models of participation.
Finally, I will assess where my research may fit in the larger context of scholarship on the topics of participation and politics on the Internet.
I. Political Participation
Scholarship in the field of participation has a fairly singular focus.
Why do people participate in politics, when do they do it, and how do they do so?
Literature on the subject tends to begin with a distinction between individually-motivated political participation and externally-motivated political participation.
In general, individually-motivated political participation falls under the category of why people participate.

Mix Proportioning and Fresh Concrete Properties
INTRODUCTION
The goal of this lab was to acquaint ourselves with the absolute volume method used to proportion Portland cement concrete mixtures and to develop a specific concrete mix design for a later project.
We were involved in all the steps of calculating proportions for the mix itself.
We also used testing procedures such as the slump test, unit weight, and amount of air entrained per unit volume.
Finally we mixed our own proportions of components and created our batch of concrete to later be used in testing.
PROCEDURE
Proportioning of Portland Cement Concrete Mixtures
I) Foremost, concrete design begins with a set of requirements and information dealing with the location of concrete and the conditions it must uphold to.
These conditions include what type of structure is being formed, the thickness of the forms, reinforcement requirements, consolidation methods, and most importantly the compressive strength needed.
Once this array of input is acquired, the mix proportioning process can begin.
II)
Begin by choosing the concrete's slump.
This is often specified for particular jobs, however when needed Table 10.1 can be used to find an appropriate slump.
It is determined according to what type of concrete structure you are poring.
The table offers a range of values, often wanting to choose the lowest slump possible.
In special situations, other considerations should be taken into account as well.
III) Once the slump has been chosen, a maximum aggregate size is determined.
Many times this is limited to the aggregate that is offered in the area or a preference to what should be used in the concrete.
For design with no supply restrictions, there are three limitations to take into account:
i.
The maximum aggregate can not exceed one-fifth of the dimension between forms
ii.
The maximum aggregate can not exceed three-fourths of the minimum spacing between bars, or between forms and bars.
iii.
The maximum aggregate can not exceed one-third the depth of a slab
IV)
Next you must estimate the amount of mixing water required as well as air content.
These are found in Table 10.2 and are based on the maximum aggregate size, slump, and whether the concrete needs to be air-entrained or not.
For the case of air-entrained concrete, air content can be determined based on the severity of exposure.
The value found is the amount of water required and percent air needed per given volume of concrete.
V) Now that the amount of water is known, you determine the amount of cement required using the water/cement ratio.
In the case of concrete made with Type I Portland cement, Table 10.3 can be used to give a general estimate of the amount of cement required.
The water/cement ratio is based on the design strength for the concrete as well as whether it needs to be air-entrained or not.
Using the ratio the amount of cement is thus calculated.
VI)
The amount of coarse aggregate to be used in the mix must now be determined.
This can be done utilizing Table 10.8.
Based on the maximum aggregate size and the fineness modulus of the fine aggregate, a value can be found in the table.
This number is then multiplied by the dry rodded unit weight of the coarse aggregate to find the required mass to be used.
VII) Everything is now known except the mass of fine aggregate.
To do this the total mass of the concrete mix must be found.
The known masses can be subtracted from Um to find the fine aggregate's mass.
VIII) Final adjusts must now be made for moisture in the aggregate.
In the case of surface moisture on the aggregate, this percent of water must be calculated and subtracted from the required amount of water in the mix.

Methanotrophs have been known as gram-negative and aerobic bacteria and they use only methane for their carbon and energy source [3].
The initial oxidation of methane to methanol is catalyzed by methane monooxygenase (MMO) that can be expressed differently depending on the environmental factors.
The most well known factor is copper concentration by which two different MMOs can be expressed: a soluble cytoplasmic MMO (sMMO) and a membrane-associated, or particulate, MMO (pMMO) [1,3,4,6].
Under low ratio of copper to biomass (≤ 0.9 nmol of Cu/mg of cell protein), the sMMO is expressed; at higher value, the pMMO is [6].
That is mainly because pMMO is a copper-based enzyme [4].
While copper plays an important role in the physiology of methanotrophs, the mechanism of copper uptake system by methanotrophs is still unclear [2].
However, sMMO's mutant of Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b [5, 7] which can express either sMMO or pMMO depending on copper concentration, suggested the presence of an extracellular copper-binding compound (CBC).
The CBC was further isolated from M. capsulatus Bath and was shown to be small polypeptides with a molecular mass of 1,232 Da [5, 8, 9].
The two strains, M. capsulatus Bath and M. trichosporium OB3b, have been known to make CBC, but other methanotrophs have never been reported to make CBC.
Since methanotrophs such as Methylomicrobium album BG8 and Methylocystis parvus OBBP need copper to express pMMO for the oxidation of methane and appear not to possess CBC, they either have a different copper uptake mechanism or have to utilize the CBC made by other methanotrophs.
This independent study was performed to achieve two goals.
The first one was to determine if there was an interaction among methanotrophs for copper uptake; i.e.
CBC, the sole copper uptake mechanism.
To do so, three methanotroph strains were chosen, M. trichosporium OB3b, M. album BG8, and M. parvus OBBP to compare their growth trends in response to the presence of CBC in the growth media.
The second goal of this study was to acquire the basic knowledge and technology of molecular analysis.
Hence, the characteristics of the bacterial strains were investigated using naphthalene assay for a verification of sMMO expression, trichloroethylene (TCE) degradation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), gel electrophoresis (GE), and capillary electrophoresis (CE).
Materials and Methods
2-1 Characterization of two methanotrophs
Organisms and growth conditions M. trichosporium OB3b, M. album BG8, and M. parvus OBBP were grown at 30℃ on the agar plates of nitrate mineral salts (NMS) medium with the presence of 10 µM copper as Cu(NO3)25H2O under a methane-air mixture (1:2 ratio) [10] and cells were transferred to a fresh NMS liquid medium.
The liquid culture medium of NMS did not exceed 15 % of the total flask volume to prevent mass transfer limitations of methane and oxygen from the headspace to liquid medium [10].
Naphthalene assay
Whole-cell sMMO activity of M. trichosporium OB3b was examined using the colorimetric naphthalene assay of Brusseau et al. [11].
Since only sMMO can oxidize naphthalene to 1- or 2- naphthol, it could be determined whether or not M. trichosporium OB3b expressed sMMO rather than pMMO depending on copper concentration by adding tetrazotized o-dianisidine to form a purple naphthol diazo complex [12].
NMS media with different copper concentrations, either 0 µM or 20 µM, were prepared to evaluate sMMO expression.
As M. trichosporium OB3b can express either sMMO or pMMO, all flasks were acid-washed in 2 N HNO3 for 2 days and 20 µM copper was added aseptically as Cu(NO3)25H2O. Cells were grown until they were in an exponential growth phase (optical density (OD) between 0.2 and 0.5) and then 2 ml of the liquid culture was aseptically transferred to 20 ml vials.
Naphthalene was then added to the cell-transferred vials, sealed and incubated at 30℃, 270 rpm for 1 hour.
35 µl of 5 N NaOH was added to the samples to disrupt cell activities. 1.5 ml of the samples were taken and centrifuged at 12,000×g for 5 min.
Lastly 130 µl of 4.21mM tetrazotized o-dianisidine was added to 1.3 ml of the supernatant for the absorbance measurement at 528 nm using Milton Roy Company Spectronic 20.
Duplicate samples were measured.
Stratification and Mobility of Chinese Peasant Workers
As a unique group emerging from the drastic social transformation in recent 20 years, the social stratification patterns among Chinese peasant workers are rather special: they are peasants, though have no or few land and earn their living mainly on work in the city; they are working and living in cities year-round, however own nearly none of the basic rights enjoyed by urban residents; this tremendous migration group of more than 120 million people may be encountering the most difficult upward mobility.
To provide information on this group and pry into the social mechanisms lying beneath this imbalance would be meaningful for our understanding of the fast changing and diversified modern transition.
Some scholars even consider the situation to be a low-level equilibrium trap.
However, my research is going to prove it to be a hasty conclusion since it ignores the necessary focus on the reference population.
That is, compared to those peasants remaining in the rural area, peasant workers are actually situated in a gradual upward mobility, although when the comparison is drawn with urban residents, this upward process is rather slow and difficult.
The mobility has also been influenced by reforms and regional socio-economic status.
However, to discuss whether they are facing a low-level equilibrium trap or not, we need first to understand what peasant worker and what low-level equilibrium trap we are referring to.
Though rooted in different historical and social background, the concept of peasant workers in the western European literature is quite similar to that in China, as a transitional population primarily composed of male heads of household who allocate their labor between full-time wage employment and the operation of a family farm (Holmes, Douglas R., 1983), which is a concise definition helpful for our understanding of the Chinese peasant workers.
In China, the emergency of peasant workers is mainly due to the historical inconsistency between the relatively scant arable land and surplus rural workforce on it.
This inconsistency turned to be even more severe after the public encouragement of Mao Tse Dung in 1949, which indirectly led the already large Chinese population towards enormous.
A second factor resulting in the large-scale group of peasant workers came from the fast growing economy in big cities, while the rural economy was left far behind.
Those already surplus rural labors were longing greatly for jobs, especially those with a higher pay expected and a situation of more job opportunities.
Big cities provided them with the hope.
Actually, to transfer rural surplus workforce in China is mainly through two ways: work in the township enterprises; or migrate into the city (Song, Linfei, 1995).
In 1960s and 70s, since the household residents registration system rigorously controlled the mobility between rural and urban area, and also because the collective work on the agricultural producing still remained, though there were more job opportunities in towns and cities, the trend of peasant migration was rather weak.
As late as 1978, when the household residents registration system was loosened to some extent with the implementation of the Household Contract Responsibility System and with the full-scale reform under the rein of Deng Xiaoping, the surplus labor existing manifested itself (Li, Qiang, 2003) conspicuously.
There was even larger labor demand after a series of reforms and in 1984 several experimental spots were set, allowing peasants to migrate into towns searching for job.
Later in 1985, State Department of China formally released relevant policies stating that peasants could open businesses or get employed in towns.
So the first way of working in township enterprises was carried out commonly at this time, which was also the starting point of the large-scale rural-urban migration, later called the peasant workers tide by the academia and media in China.
However, the second way of migrating into the city was not becoming dominant until 1990s when the household resident registration system became quite diversified, though still rigid for those super cities.
This relatively lower institutional impediment worked well enough for stimulating the migration of peasants, who later formed a tremendous peasant workers tide.
Until then, the transfer of rural surplus labor turned to be a conspicuous phenomenon in transforming China, which was not only a vivid expression of China’s vigorous growth and drastic changes, but also an issue bringing about intense attention on social inequality.
The theory of low-level equilibrium trap raised by economist Richard R.
Nelson was a crucial theory both for the explanation of developing economies and relevant social science of development.
The theory focused on the mutual influences between population growth, the quantity of net capital formation and changes in income from a macro perspective.
From his point of view, development is a race between net capital formation and population growth.
Italy toughens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean they will not be allowed to continue if they do not sign up to new rules governing their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign up to a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue operating," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities impounded a boat operated by German aid organisatiion Jugend Rettet on suspicion its crew effectively collaborated with people traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been operational for a year, declined to comment on the substance of detailed allegations made against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us the rescue of human life is and will be our top priority, so we are very sorry we will not be able to operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organisation said in a statement on social media.
"We can only assess all the accusations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."
Italian authorities had been monitoring Jugend Rettet's boat, the Iuventa, since October.
Its crew is suspected to taking on board dinghy loads of migrants delivered directly to them by people traffickers and allowing the smugglers to make off with the vessels to be used again.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.
The crew are suspected of having flouted the authority of the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the zone, out of humanitarian zeal rather than for any other motives.
Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa would notably have to have an Italian police officer on board monitoring their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter said on Thursday it regarded the new rules as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve any "significant change or impediment" to its rescue operations.
Among those who have refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti meanwhile said a sharp fall over recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy following rescues was an indication that efforts to beef up the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors was bearing fruit.
"In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed plans for further talks this month with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.

Throughout history, plague has been made infamous as the ultimate biological killer.
The word is now synonymous with any particularly contagious, lethal, and uncontrollable epidemic.
However, the true plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, has largely been ignored in recent years.
Many people think of plague as an extinct disease of the Middle Ages, a horrifying tale from history class that has been eliminated from society through time and technology.
Of course, this is not the case.
Although plague, like many other diseases, has been eliminated from industrial countries, it continues to afflict most parts of the world.
In fact, just last month, pneumonic plague killed over 60 people in a recently reopened diamond mine in the northeastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The situation is even more dangerous because DRC is close to the border of Sudan, where a long civil war and political unrest in Darfur are forcing many refugees to escape to neighboring countries under unsanitary conditions.
The lack of concern about plague in the developed world also presents another complication to preventing its spread; while treatments and vaccines for plague exist, they are not widely distributed, and knowledge about them has decreased considerably.
In the Middle Ages, the Europeans were much more susceptible to this newly introduced infection than those in the tropics.
The developed world faces the same situation today, since very few people have developed antibodies to fight off the infection.
The insidious character of this bacterium, combined with the lack of preparedness to face such an outbreak, might make plague an ideal agent for bioterrorists seeking death and major havoc.
Even without this bioweapon potential, plague is still a widely occurring but poorly understood disease.
It is therefore important to return to a scientific study of the bacterium, particularly in understanding how it spreads and what measures can be taken to control its threat.
The majority of literature on plague dates back to the Middle Ages, when the disease was much more rampant.
While studies of plague were scarce in the 18th-19th centuries, there was resurgence in interest at the turn of the 20th century when a major pandemic hit Asia.
Subsequently, though, interest in and literature on the disease has disappeared.
There has been virtually no coverage of the topic in major scientific journals, including those in parasitology.
The most recent epidemiological works on plague date from the 1970s and early 1980s, but the information in these texts is still considered accurate by most parasitologists today.
This paper will therefore concentrate on these books and reports, while occasionally including new information from more recent articles.
The essay will begin with a brief historical analysis of plague outbreaks, and then explore plague's geographical distribution, with the goal of understanding where the disease originated and how this might affect population resistance.
Then, the organisms involved in plague ecology will be discussed in detail: the first is the plague bacterium Yersinia pestis ; next are several of the common flea and other arthropod vectors of the disease; subsequently the small mammalian reservoir hosts of plague will be considered, concentrating on rats but also with a discussion of campestral foci; finally, methods of human infection with the plague bacterium and its effects are investigated.
After understanding the ecology of plague, preventative and control measures at each stage of the infectious cycle and their effectiveness are examined.
Finally, social and political questions about plague are raised, particularly its threat as a bioterrorist weapon and the role of international health policy in eradicating this disease.
A Brief History of Plague
The bubonic plague pandemic of the 14th century, more commonly referred to as the Black Death or Great Dying, is probably the most well known and documented health disaster in history.

Integrated Literature Review and Proposal for Provider-Patient Interaction
Background and Significance
Despite advances in medical care, technology, and services, racial/ethnic disparities in reproductive birth outcomes have remained unchanged or increased for more than a decade (Martin, Kochanek, Strobino, Guyer,&amp;
MacDorman, 2005, Iyasu&amp;
Tomashek, 2002).
Consistently, the rate of infant mortality for black women has been twice as high as compared to white women (Martin et.al., 2005).
Low birth weight (LBW) (&lt;2500g, 5.8 lbs) remains the leading cause of infant mortality in blacks (Matthews, Menacker,&amp; MacDorman, 2003).
In 2003, the LBW for black women was approximately double the rate for white women (13.5% vs 7%) (Martin et.al., 2005).
However, the etiology of the persistent racial/ethnic disparities in birth outcomes is still clearly not understood.
Past studies have examined maternal factors during pregnancy such as low socioeconomic status (SES), environment, genetics, social and psychological stressors, maternal risky behavior, lack of prenatal care, and perinatal infections as possible explanations for poor birth outcomes in African American infants (Lu&amp;
Halfon, 2003; Hogan, Njoroge, Durant,&amp;
Ferre, 2001).
One method to improve the birth outcomes for black infants is through prenatal care.
Documented evidence exists showing the relationship of prenatal care in decreasing the incidence of LBW and preterm births (Herbst, Mercer, Beazley, Meyer,&amp;
Carr, 2003, Alexander, Kotelchuck, 2001, Institute of Medicine [IOM], 1985, Gortmaker, 1979).
Through the expansion of Medicaid coverage for low-income pregnant women, there has been a steady rise with prenatal care utilization for African American women (Martin et.al., 2005; Kogan et.al., 1998).
Prenatal care provides women with the opportunity to be introduced and integrated into the health system thereby receiving preventive care, education regarding pregnancy and birth, and special ancillary services such as mental health counseling, smoking cessation clinics, drug rehabilitation programs that benefit both the mother and the infant.
At the heart of prenatal care is the communication between the patient and the provider.
Effective communication influences the quality of provider-patient interaction, patient behaviors, and health outcomes (Stewart, 1995).
In fact, Healthy People 2010 objectives recognize the impact of quality provider-patient communication in improving quality of care and the health status of individuals (US Department of Health and Human Services [USDHHS], 2003).
Specific recommendations include improving provider-patient relationships through effective communication skills training and increasing the proportion of patients who are satisfied with their providers' communication skills (USDHHS, 2003).
Similarly, one of the priority recommendations from IOM report (2001), Crossing the Quality Chasm, is improving provider communication by adopting a patient-centeredness model of care that emphasizes patients' involvement in clinical decision-making and considers their needs, values, and preferences.
However, for the African American women, negative past experiences with, mistrust in providers, experiences with discrimination, poor patient-provider communication have contributed to inadequate use of prenatal care; thus, potentially increasing the risk of poor maternal and infant outcomes (Dole et.al., 2004, Mikhail, 1999, Teagle&amp;
Brindis, 1998, Moore, 2004).
Furthermore, one of the most controversial findings from the Institute of Medicine's publication of Unequal Treatment (2003) stated that provider bias, stereotyping, prejudice, and uncertainties in clinical decision-making may contribute to racial/ethnic healthcare disparities.
Thus, the author hypothesizes that quality provider-patient interaction may indirectly influence infant outcomes by increasing maternal satisfaction of care leading to increased utilization of prenatal services.
To explore how provider characteristics affect provider-patient interaction in terms of maternal ratings' of care, an integrated literature review was conducted on African American women's interactions with their providers during prenatal care.
Method
To explore the research literature on African American women's interactions with their health care provider during prenatal care, an on-line computer search from 1995-2005 was conducted by the author from PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PSYCHINFO using the following key terms professional-patient relations, provider-patient interaction, physician patient relations, prenatal, African American, discrimination, perceived discrimination, satisfaction, healthcare utilization, and communication.
Retrieval was limited to articles in English, adults (19-44years), African American and females.
In addition, the sample size needed to be composed of more than 45% of African American adult females of childbearing age (19-44years).
"Drunk Girls are Easy:"
Binge-Drinking College Women's Engagement with the Slutty Discourse and its Implications for Sexual Violence
Abstract
This paper seeks to explore the co-constitutive and dynamic engagement of late adolescent, binge-drinking women with the 'slutty' discourse and its implications for the risk (and experience) of sexual assault, which is one aspect of gender construction in the context of campus party culture.
Using data from in-depth interviews with 31 undergraduate women who self-identified as frequent binge drinkers from a large, elite, public, Midwestern University.
I show how the women I interviewed engage with a discourse of "sluttiness" in the sexualized campus party culture.
I discuss several implications of the particular form of engagement undertaken by the women I interviewed, and provide suggestions for intervention into feminist theory and anti-sexual violence practice.
In the fall of my senior year in high school, two of my closest girlfriends and I left the large, Midwestern, city we lived in and drove an hour south to tour an highly elite, private liberal arts college.
This school was consistently ranked by the US News and World Report in the top 5 liberal arts schools in the country, and widely considered the best school in the region.
Being smart and career-minded young women with close ties to family, friends, and boyfriends in the city we lived in, we all hoped to like it.
While on the tour with 10 or so other high school juniors and seniors -and a few parents - also visiting the school, I asked the tour guide about rape on campus.
From my experiences in high school and feminist politics I knew/believed that sexual assault was widespread and pervasive, however this particular school had experienced a well-publicized rape the previous year, and I was curious to see how she would respond to my question.
The tour guide responded by telling me about rape whistles, showing me the lights that lit nearly all corners of the small, isolated campus.
She then told me, in a dismissive tone, that, besides, the only sexual assault cases they had involved alcohol.
This incident left a powerful impression on me.
At the time, I thought that was a ridiculous response.
I remember sarcastically commenting to my friends that as there was no alcohol on campus we would all be safe.
At the time, my assumption was that the tour guide's response was her way of providing a quick answer to a difficult question, while simultaneously managing to reassure the parents on the tour that their children could be safe at that school as long as they chose to avoid (being around) alcohol.
It was not until later that I began to think about the implicit devaluing of (the experiences of) the women/girls who chose to drink and/or be around others drinking; girls who chose to participate in campus party culture.
This paper is a study of those girls - the ones who choose to participate in campus party culture - and their perceptions of the risk of sexual violence.
The larger project from which the data for this paper is drawn explores the co-constructions of gender and partying through the mechanisms of peer culture, same and cross-gender relationships, bodily experiences of alcohol and drug consumption, sexuality, the pleasures and dangers of partying - including the risk of sexual violence, and their variations along different identity dimensions (such as race, ethnicity, class, sorority status).
The focus of this paper is on one particular aspect of gender construction in the context of partying: the co-constitutive and dynamic engagement of late adolescent, binge-drinking women with the slutty discourse and its implications for the risk (and experience) of sexual assault.
Through analysis of data from 31 in-depth interviews, I show some ways in which the binge-drinking college women who I interviewed engage with a discourse of sluttiness in the sexualized campus party culture.
Michelle Carter sentenced for texts urging suicide of Conrad Roy
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her term behind bars and five years of probation.
Carter was convicted in June of the involuntary manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on 13 July 2014.
Mr Roy's father told Thursday's hearing: "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free pending an appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal team argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood tearfully with hands clasped and eyes cast down as she was sentenced.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to better her own.
She has not accepted responsibility," she said.
"She has shown no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "horrible circumstance that she completely regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her "age or level of maturity or even her mental illness have any significant impact on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Mr Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying there was "not one day I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I am handling everything - I am trying to be there for his sisters in all of my pain we will carry with us for eternity," it said.
Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the realisation that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"Not having that one person I've been with every day since birth is a pain I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case appears to set a legal precedent, as there is no Massachusetts law that criminalises telling a person to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 when Mr Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself I don't know there's a lot of ways," she said in several messages sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You need to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention through Mr Roy's death, ordering that she not be allowed to profit from the case through any press.

If Only I Had Read Ahead
I was very disappointed when I read the readings for this week.
The exercise at the end of the book chapter and the Schwartz article were reminiscent of the experience I had over Fall Break of looking for a suit.
Overall it was an unpleasant experience with a happy conclusion, but I hope to keep the paradox of choice in mind when I decide it is time to buy another suit.
I have several interviews for post-graduation jobs scheduled for the coming weeks.
Going over the choice for what to wear to these tense sessions, I found that I had very little professional-attire pieces in my closet.
I decided I needed to go out and purchase an adult outfit.
Talking with one of my friends, we found ourselves in the same predicament and we decided to go at it together.
We dragged another one of our girlfriends and together the three of us stormed Briarwood Mall.
Four agonizing hours later my friend Martha had the perfect outfit and I had nothing.
I was tempted to go ahead and just buy an expensive and semi-stylish jacket from Express, but I was not altogether comfortable shelling out over a hundred dollars for a suit jacket I was not even sure was really something I would want to wear.
About to give up, I made a mad dash into Sears.
The first thing I saw was a black jacket hanging alone among brightly colored blouses.
It was the only one in the section and I had a small sliver of hope that it might be the one for me.
I picked it up, saw it was my size, noticed it was on sale, and bought it.
As an added bonus it looked like it would be a pretty close match for a pair of dress pants I already owned.
$15 later I was a satisfied shopper.
The summary of the results of the studies looking at expanded choice as demotivating (Schwartz, pg. 19) did not surprise me very much after spending this day at the mall.
I had spent the better part of an afternoon searching in vain through multiple stores and departments and trying on countless jackets.
As the jam and chocolate tasters behaved, I too was less likely to want to have those things that I had tried out of an endless supply.
The large array was discouraging and I found myself not enjoying the experience of shopping.
Reflecting on this outing I realized that I had been putting too much emphasis on my search for the perfect suit.
I was getting agitated and depressed that I had not been able to find just the right outfit and to make it worse, the girl I was shopping with had.
This realization had probably also affected my decision to buy a jacket and probably influenced me to want to buy a similar stylish jacket that I would not have been able to afford.
I wish I had read the readings a week earlier!
To have been able to cut out the first four hours and zoom right in to the time window where I had spent less than ten minutes finding something that fit me and my budget would have been glorious.
The jacket probably will not last long in my wardrobe, it should not have taken up so much of my energy to find.
In the end though, I was satisfied with my purchase and I think it was the result of just finding something simple that worked.
Hopefully in the future I'll be able to keep the mindset that finding something I only plan on wearing about three times should not take up most of my day.

Audi to Modify Up to 850,000 Diesel Vehicles as Carmakers Face Backlash
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believed "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," referring to the European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - that have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the moves as recalls.
European carmakers have heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens, and can cause asthma.
The cost to automotive companies of installing equipment to neutralize the fumes emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.
As German automakers face scrutiny, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of coddling the powerful car companies and of ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which covered up its use of so-called defeat devices that could adjust emissions to comply with regulations when a car was being tested, but ease back in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian, and therefore is not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Early this year, Audi was swept up into a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to evade emissions rules in Europe, broadening an inquiry that had focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: The luxury carmaker accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profit.

D11, or how not to build a motorway.
Can the motorways in the Czech Republic ever be finished?
Here's a puzzle for you.
It is unfinished, even though construction started in 1978.
Even though it hasn't materialised, it is constantly being repaired.
It can't be built, even though it has a building permit.
What is it?
Yes, that's right, motorway D11 to Hradec Králové.
Construction on another section of it has recently halted by the Děti Země (Children of the Earth) movement for at least several months.
We Eastern Bohemians are getting our motorway in pieces, like cutting slices off a salami.
One round is sliced and then we have to wait and see if and when we'll get another.
We're not asking for miracles, though.
We just want to shorten driving times and to divert trucks going to or from Poland away from villages and towns.
The endless streams of trucks go straight through the towns like Jaroměř or Náchod, which cannot be reasonably avoided.
The final stretch of our dream motorway was begun in 2008, that is, an unbelievable nine years ago.
Since then, there hasn't been a modicum of progress.
Therefore, when construction began on the remaining four kilometres of the incomplete section to Hradec Králové and an archaeological survey was carried out other sections by Jaroměř, with works due to begin at the end of this year, you could hear corks being popped loudly in Eastern Bohemia.
At this point, nobody believed it however.
Last week it was announced that construction will not take place this year.
And maybe not next year either.
Děti Země, an organisation from Brno fighting for sustainable transport, has put a halt on the works.
Děti Země is repeating its tactics from D1.
They opposed the decision to grant the building permit in its entirety.
They are demanding a review of all the binding opinions already issued by all authorities involved.
For example, these include the City of Hradec Králové, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence and the Railway Authority.
Meanwhile, not far from D11 we come across the village with the expressive name of Pohřebačka.
We drive down, we simply continue along the motorway and all of a sudden we find ourselves on the side road next to it so we can join the line of traffic.
The worst part is that you can see similar stories across the country.
There's the terrifying, constantly clogged road to Benešov, the D1 or D8 motorways.
Everyone has their own Pohřebačka.
What did Děti Země request?
What is the at the heart of the problems with road construction in the Czech Republic?
And why is motorway network practically impossible to finish within the current system?

Case Study Analysis of Emergency Contraception Can Reveal Characteristics of Society as a Whole
The condom broke.
I was sexually assaulted on my way home from a late night studying at the library.
My boyfriend came to town unexpectedly after I missed a pill earlier this week.
I couldn't just insert my diaphragm in front of him!
A number of circumstances in a woman's life may result in unprotected sexual intercourse.
In such an event, although the probability of becoming pregnant peaks at 17% upon ovulation, if a woman takes no preventative measure, an unplanned pregnancy may result.
Emergency contraception (EC) comes in two forms: hormonal pills or a copper-T Intra-Uterine Device (IUD).
Oral EC imparts either a high dose of progestin or both estrogen and progestin in combined hormone pills with an average 88% success rate of preventing pregnancy when used within at least 72 hours and up to 120 hours after unprotected intercourse.
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) defines the start of pregnancy as the point of implantation of the blastocyst - a fertilized egg that has begun developing into an embryo - into the uterine lining.
After the introduction of sperm into the female reproductive tract, but before blastocyst implantation, EC operates to prevent pregnancy in a variety of ways based on a woman's position in her menstrual cycle.
Beyond successful implantation, EC has no effect on the pending pregnancy and therefore does not induce abortion (Kane- Low, 2004).
Because of its function, EC provides an opportunity for women who prefer to decrease the risk of becoming pregnant to exercise reproductive agency after unprotected intercourse.
Of the three million unplanned pregnancies that occur annually in the United States, up to half end in abortion, but in 2000, as many as 51,000 abortions were averted with the use of [EC] (Kane-Low, 2004; Steinberg, 2327).
Case study analysis of arguments for and against EC, the differential access to EC that women experience, and the political approach to EC use for survivors of sexual assault reveal that the personal is routinely made political with decreased female agency and limited sexuality as a result, that racial, ethnic, and classist subjectivity within the health care system leads to restricted and disproportionate access to health care services, and the directions in which political efforts are made.
When these revealed characteristics are extrapolated to society as a whole, they construct a model of the health care system and the society it services.
In addition to reporting research findings on the medicinal use of EC, academic writers contribute unique perspectives to the debate over EC availability and the struggle for federally approved OTC status.
Current investigations center on the effectiveness of a one pill form of EC versus the conventional two pill prescription as well as on the effectiveness of anti-emetic drugs like meclizine for reducing the side-effects of EC (Robinson, 2004).
Much of the academic discussion following the May 2004 FDA decision to deny OTC status for Plan B centers on consequences for political dynamics between health care professionals, scientists who work to manufacture pharmaceuticals, pro-life and religious representatives, and government entities who introduce legislation relevant to reproductive health.
While Fundamentalist Christian groups such as the Family Research Council and Concerned Women for America applauded the decision, feminist writers, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. and ACOG criticize the FDA decision: not only does this morally repugnant act hinder the availability of EC, but it also provides support for recent criticisms that political interference is hampering scientific review within federal agencies.

Provence lavender under threat from climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it's under threat from climate change.
Lavender is in decline because of drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing a major headache for scientists and farmers attempting to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered, because in recent years the plant has been subjected to the effects of climate change that brought a lot less rain in the spring and mostly in the autumn.
This affects the lifespan of lavender.
There's also a small cicada, a micro-bacteria transmitting leaf hopper, and in very dry weather there are lots of them."
And a lot is at stake.
As well as attracting holidaymakers, lavender oil is highly sought after for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a number of large flowers, we have smaller ones, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
Solutions being looked at include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and developing varieties more resistant to dry conditions.
Orientalism and History
Edward W.
Said’s Orientalism, despite and perhaps because of its controversial and polemical nature, has achieved its own authoritative status in today’s academia.
Many historians of the Orient have adopted concepts and views expressed in Orientalism in their own works.
As such, I remember the first time I read the book, expecting to find this overarching theory that was applicable to my field of Chinese history.
As Said himself has admitted and a critic has pointed out, however, the scope of Orientalism is nothing like as extensive as its title suggests.
Said focuses mainly on the Anglo-French Orientalism in the Middle East starting from the last third of the eighteenth century.
His argument did not seem to apply to other so-called Third World regions that had been affected by Western colonialism.
As a result, I found myself disappointed the first time.
Now, I seek to answer the same question that I asked myself three years ago, but with a very different answer:
What were the appeals of this book that gave it its staying power?
This time, I have found it useful to distinguish the questions that Said raises and Said’s overall argument in Orientalism.
After one makes such a distinction, it becomes easier to read the work in a more constructive way that broadens one’s historical methodologies and perspectives.
As many critics have pointed out, Said’s overall argument is less than satisfactory from its beginning, development, and conclusion.
The first main problem I see is Said’s act of delimitation.
Said focuses on the modern British-French-American Orientalism in the Islamic Middle East, which starts roughly from Napoleon’s Egyptian expedition of 1798.
He contends that Britain and France were not only pioneers of Oriental studies but also were two greatest colonial powers before twentieth century.
America, on the other hand, has replaced the void of those two starting from the World War II (17).
The focus on the Middle East is influenced very much by Said’s personality.
Said himself admits that for him the Islamic Middle East had to be center of attention because of his personal experience as an Oriental growing up in two British colonies and living in America.
At this point, I did not have much problem with Said’s delimitation.
After all, as Said himself says, every work has to start with the same act of delimitation.
We as historians have to decide on the scope and relevant sources of a project before we embark on our actual research; it is a starting point of any academic project.
After reading various reviews of the work, however, I began to see the problem.
For example, Said explains that the lack of Germany’s national interest in the Orient prevented the lack of a close partnership between German Orientalism and colonialism and thus he will not include German Orientalism in his study (17-19).
As a number of critics have pointed out, however, German Orientalism was as influential as French-British Orientalism.
Here one can see how Said’s exclusion of German Orientalism actually preconditions and directs his study of Orientalism.
He knows that German Orientalism does not look like his idea of Orientalism, and therefore he excludes it from his list.

Introduction
Abortion is a very controversial topic for conversation today—in the 21st century—where it has achieved mainstream visibility in the political sphere.
The controversy often revolves around opposing claims of rights and polarized feelings of support for the baby’s right to life and thus opposition to abortion or support for the choice of the woman carrying the baby and thus support for abortion.
More than a medical option (though not a consistently legal medical option across the States), abortion is an issue involving widespread disagreement over its appropriate level of legislation.
Pro-life activists often argue that because it involves the question of life, abortion is a moral issue.
In 2004, many voters admitted this issue was singularly used to direct their choice for President of the United States.
These voters were subsequently classified as moral voters.
So this begs the question: how far is morality interconnected with abortion?
Are these two concepts causally related?
In my study, I will be examining whether or not religious attitudes affect personal feelings on abortion.
My research question is:
Are religious people more likely to be against abortion than non-religious people.
My hypothesis is that religious people are more against abortion (pro-life) than non-religious people.
I believe religious people view abortion as a cruel and negative thing because they think it is taking the life of a baby whereas non-religious people tend to think of abortion not in terms of the life of the baby but in terms of the mother carrying the baby.
They believe abortion is a necessary freedom of choice.
Research Design
I am interested in how individual opinions of abortion are affected by religious views, so my unit of analysis will be individuals.
The two concepts I am studying are religiosity and feelings on abortion.
Religious people are my main interest group, so non-religious people are my comparison group.
My independent variable is the level of religiosity of my unit (individuals) studied, and feelings on abortion is my dependent variable.
My ideal study population would be a representative population of all United States citizens, with a wide distribution of gender, age, class, region, and race.
My actual study population is University of Michigan students because they are who I have access to speak with.
To best collect my data for these variables, I chose to use semi-structured individual interviews by approaching individuals in different locations on campus and asking their feelings on abortion and how religious they are.
I measured religiosity by asking different questions I thought indicated the level of how religious people are.
I measured feelings on abortion by asking their overall view on it and then narrowing to specific circumstances if necessary.
I chose this type of interview instead of a structured paper questionnaire because I decided I wanted to involve the respondents more.
I wanted them to be able to expand on the extent of their abortion views and religiosity, without being confined to answer sets created by me.
Indeed, an advantage of this method is that they could give more explanation so that I could understand their position better than I would have from a survey question.
Abortion can be a complicated topic, so it is important to clarify with people the type of abortion they are envisioning and the circumstances they believe are appropriate for it to be legal.
Having an open-ended question format also allowed them to demonstrate the salience of the issues in their minds.
When they introduced a topic on their own, I could trust it was on the top of their mind whereas if they had circled it as a survey question option, they would not necessarily have cared about it without my drawing attention to it.
Disadvantages of this method revolve around the sample.
A journalist's murder underscores growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce normally meets on Wednesdays to review their plans for coverage of the most recent mayhem wrought in Sinaloa state by organized crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.
But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they've come together to talk about security.
It's important to change their routines, they are told.
Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: to take their children with them to the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: adversaries, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.
There are drug-traffickers, politicians, businesspeople, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalog of villains who make the job of covering Mexico's chaos perilous.
There is no respite from the violence, and as bodies pile up across the country, more and more of them are journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 under federal protection after attacks and threats; and so far this year, at least seven dead in seven states.
Among the latest is their editor and inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The greatest error is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on narco-violence.
His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez displaying his middle finger, with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building; two reporters on their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that display his smiling, bespectacled face or his trademark Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death; the reporters discuss their shared trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle the journalists' cases, it has only prosecuted two, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders tied to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they persist in covering the violence of Sinaloa, though they are heartbroken, though the terrain is more treacherous now.
Without information on the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security, says Ibarra, is of little use.
"It's very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, you distrust everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital of Culiacan.
He managed to drive just a couple blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably for the name of the paper - which translates as Twelfth River.
The gunman drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a wife and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there's practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum.
Never mind that someone or several people are shot dead in the street every day in Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings, larger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that a state of "calm" is when just one cartel is in control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug-trafficking routes to the United States.
Despite that, and the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the perils of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is wracked with guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He believes two errors contributed to the killing.
First there was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman's sons.
The piece may have angered the sons; suspected gang members bought up every copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to newsstands.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that carried the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He'd survived for so long, his friends and colleagues assumed he'd always be there.
He was a veteran reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in creating Riodoce, selling $50 shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without touching the narco issue," said Bojorquez.
Over time the paper earned a reputation for brave and honest coverage, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories nobody else dared to cover.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, it won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for coverage in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug story wherever it led.
He freely acknowledged that he was frightened.
"I want to carry on living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to assume the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play dumb.
I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of so much death ... why didn't you say what was going on?'"
The Riodoce staff misses Valdez, the jokester who swore like a longshoreman, the friend generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and would always sit at the same table.
Now, they ask: Was his love of routine his downfall?
His death also has forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and stay alive.
"They don't like it if you mess with their women, their children, their clean businesses, their clandestine airstrips" used to move drugs.
"Those things were off-limits," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best of times, a high-level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trusting one's instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away.
The trouble, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, is that "smell is a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing with Javier happened."
The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they don't in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.
The landscape constantly shifts.
In the room where Riodoce staff met for security training, suddenly no cellphones were allowed; days before, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought relief from the 104-degree (40 Celsius) heat in the shade of a tree.
They were assigned by the state government to guard Riodoce's offices, housed in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half-jokingly, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers are among the 50 percent of cops whom the governor himself has said are not trustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountainous countryside, where the drug gangs are in de facto control.
For this week's edition Riodoce was looking at three main stories.
There was the killing of former boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.
They also had an expose on government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping in one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word on who was abducted or how it happened, so caution set in when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite of both drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party, or PRI, which dominated all levels of politics for nearly all of the last century.
Recently several PRI governors have been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about prior incidents in that locale, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just months before, readers would have looked to Valdez's column for the best-sourced information about the kidnapping.
"Before, we would have already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender build.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken."
Valdez's office has been repurposed as a storage room for signs and stickers protesting journalist killings, as staff have become something they never expected to be: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few of the signs and headed out the next morning for a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office over yet another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
A burned body has been discovered and officials say it is his, based on DNA tests.
Nationwide, journalists have become more vocal, scrawling "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
On this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.
She has since asked to be reassigned from covering the government, concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, complicit government officials and an indifferent society.
In his last book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporters are being killed not just by drug gangs but on the order of politicians and security forces in cahoots with organized crime.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and public officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez said.
Clearly, the murders have a chilling effect.
No one forgets the death six years ago of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note purportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some outlets have opted to close, such as the newspaper El Norte, in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the killing of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others keep going, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did following the killing of its director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels publicly with a front-page editorial titled, "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
It's a wrenching decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they still scan the streets, looking for danger.
And sometimes, they are hunted down, as apparently was photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in a Mexico City apartment three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it's a daily dance of high-risk decisions.
Ibarra - who once wanted to be a poet - admits that covering the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on a recent Friday, with the latest issue already put to bed, Riodoce editors sat on the sidewalk outside the office, drinking beer, when all at once, their phones began to buzz.
A series of shootouts involving gang rivals and security forces near the beach resort city of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as was promised by a series of cartel messages discovered in the area.
From the curb, via cellphone, they put the news up on Riodoce's website.
The front page would have to be changed the next day.
Sirens wailed nearby - another shootout in the area.
Bojorquez glanced over at the police officers standing guard to see if they were alert.
If they were at all afraid, they didn't show it.
Beneath the massive portrait of their newspaper's fallen founder, his middle finger displayed for all of Sinaloa to see, the staff of Riodoce was following in his footsteps.
"How can you even think of closing," Bojorquez said, "when the same day Javier was killed the intern asked me to send her out to report on the street?"
Dinosaur used camouflage to evade its enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue albeit a terrifying one.
Now researchers have revealed the first findings from the incredible rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miner were so well preserved experts have described it as 'the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs'.
It was so well preserved, they were even able to determine the colour of its scaly skin was a reddish brown - and say it had something of a 'troubled past'.
The report in the journal Current Biology described it as 'the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.'
The fossil is a newfound species of nodosaur, which lived midway through the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
It's incredible well preserved state has stunned researchers, who describe it as 'truly remarkable'
The armoured plant-eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind ever found, according to reports in National Geographic.
It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He hit something which seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he uncovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years working on uncovering the beast within the 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) lump of earth.
After all that hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled.
'If you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping,' said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is on display.
'It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'
By studying its skin, researchers found that this plant-eater, though covered in armor and resembling a walking tank, likely faced a significant threat from meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armoured dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and employed a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern-day animals.
This would have allowed it to better blend into its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was preyed on by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature, part of the nodosaur family, first hit headlines in May and is now on view at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied and named the beast Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly uncovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour across its body.
They discovered countershading, a common method of defence in the animal kingdom, which means the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although countershading is common, the findings come as surprise because Borealopelta's size far exceeds that of countershaded animals alive today.
It suggests the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favoured concealment over confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that have countershading -- think deer, zebras or armadillos -- are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, signaling that this nodosaur faced a real struggle to survive.
'Strong predation on a massive, heavily-armored dinosaur illustrates just how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been,' said Brown.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also reveal that the dinosaur's skin would have been reddish brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut contents to find out what it ate for its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was swept out to sea, where it sank on its back to the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as south Florida is today, and rivers and oceans likely spread far further inland than they do now.
'This nodosaur is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in preserved scaly skin, yet is also preserved in three dimensions, retaining the original shape of the animal,' said Brown.
'The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did back in the Early Cretaceous.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it; if you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping.'
The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its formidable ancestors.
They include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38ft (11.5m) long monster weighing six tonnes.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta was washed out to sea after it died and mummified in mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armour, and is complete from the snout to hips.
The creatures were around 18 feet (five metres) long on average, and weighted up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It featured two 20-inch-long spikes which protruded from its shoulders.
The researchers believe that the this armored plant-eater lumbered through what is now western Canada, until a flooded river swept it into open sea.
But the dinosaur's undersea burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilised remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that remnants of skin still cover bumpy armour plates along the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such level of preservation 'is a rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more mind-boggling it becomes.
Fossilized remnants of skin still cover the bumpy armor plates dotting the animal's skull.
Its right forefoot lies by its side, its five digits splayed upward.
I can count the scales on its sole.'

I leaned back in my swivel chair and sighed, wishing the instructions explicitly told me what my teacher wanted.
Honors English already felt overwhelming and I hadn't even started school yet.

On multiple occasions I had to do a career study, which entailed researching a profession and regurgitating the facts in my own words.

The body of my paper was similar to a close reading, though I never knew that term in high school.
My writing process was plagued by doubt, and the pressure to meet the new higher standards of honors English caused a lot of anxiety.
The end result was a wholly unremarkable paper in most respects.
It was not the best or worst thing I'd ever written, and it was only one of several English essays I wrote that summer.
What makes the Pemberley essay so memorable is that it marked my first attempt at writing the type of paper that is expected at the university level.

How one activist came to learn the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'
On Aug. 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just a day after arriving in New York City on a trip, the St. Louis native sat on the bed of an Airbnb she was renting, scrolling through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled upon a post from someone from high school.
"The police just killed an 18 year old kid and he's still laying in the street," it read.
Confused, noticing no one else on her feed had posted the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was being constantly retweeted onto her timeline.
The St. Louis-area rapper was live-tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out in the street, where it would stay for four hours.
"This is wild," Ferrell thought to herself.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She put down her phone only to return later that evening to tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were photos of police tape and people yelling, and of a guy claiming to be Brown's father holding a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, a different cop, she said, cocked his rifle and screamed, "I'll kill all you ... animals."
"'This is not usual,'" Ferrell recalled saying.
"'This isn't the type of murder that we've become used to and can call typical.'
In that moment I felt chills.
I was angry and crying."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her dad's house and decided the two of them would head to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened, to Ferrell and to Ferguson in the following almost three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in theaters Aug. 11.
It's a tale of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the vantage point of the people who live in the community and packed the streets demanding answers.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and matching crown, the two revisited a conversation they'd had countless times before that morning "about the black experience and black condition."
"You remember how I taught you about when black people had to fight for what they believed in?" she recalled saying.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right.
I couldn't not take her," Ferrell said later.
"This happening today is a culmination of ... that has happened in the past.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
She needs to be well developed in the area of not just activism and organizing but knowing the different layers of the black experience and the black condition and what we must do to get free, to free ourselves.
Even if I'm fortunate enough to provide her an experience where she doesn't personally experience blatant racism, she is no different than the next black woman-child.
I feel like I would be doing her a disservice to shield her from that."
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a site across from the police department that became a campground of sorts as the activists awaited word of Officer Darren Wilson's eventual non-indictment.
There Ferrell and her daughter linked up with a local business owner who was making sack lunches.
They prepared bags and helped pass them out to protesters.
Slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism completely transformed after Aug. 9," she said, noting that while an undergrad at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and focused on food justice and health disparities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It all just came."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her director of photography Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "just wanted to document" what was happening.
A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?"
That skepticism was informed by countless instances of people - often white - coming into a community to profit off its pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We had heard that people who are born and raised in Ferguson were not having their voices centered, and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already linked up with co-director Damon Davis, an area artist known for his activism around death row inmates.
His involvement endeared Ferrell to the project, along with six other locals the "Whose Streets?" team followed in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not somebody speaking for us or speaking to us, it's us speaking," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people will be represented, because that's how I will be represented."
While the goal wasn't to focus on Ferrell's experience - in an effort to show that the movement is "not about a messiah leader but a community coming together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most open of the film's participants.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, like falling in love and marrying her wife.
"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing about the first time she saw the finished product.
"But I understood that with doing this work and humanizing black folks, there has to be a level of vulnerability."
Moreover, Ferrell's story reiterates and re-centers the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders - who coined #BlackLivesMatter on social media in the aftermath of the 2012 killing of black teen Trayvon Martin - identify as queer.
"Black queer women in leadership has sustained the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and that's because we're constantly at battle on multiple fronts.
Black queer women have to bear the brunt of it all."
Folayan agreed noting that "the movement is really upheld by black women and a lot of queer black women."
She insists, however, that "this is not some affirmative action type of thing" where Ferrell was chosen as the film's heart because of her identities.
"She was the person who was galvanizing this energy," she said.
"It's not a coincidence though she was on the front lines, because living life at those intersections as a black queer woman, you have so much on the line.
You can feel her energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the news cameras are long gone but fraught racial ties between the community and police persist.
Ferrell is on probation for 2½ more years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls home simply: "A mess."
Still, she clings to a chant she's committed to memory since taking to Ferguson's streets a full three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
My Life Is Not a Movie Starring Michelle Pfeiffer or Hilary Swank
What am I supposed to do wit' chu?
Perched behind her shoddy metal desk, the large Black woman eyed me up and down.
Ignoring the thirty-eight pairs of eyes now glued on me, I contemplated turning around and running out of the classroom.
Well – um – I'm actually a teaching intern with the Chicago Public Schools, and I'm just here to observe you, and then – well – teach the class, I responded, pretending that her question had been completely cordial and appropriate.
And you're my mentor teacher, I thought.
Awesome.
Apparently satisfied with my explanation, Ms. Taylor pointed to a discolored yellow chair next to her desk and told me to have a seat.
I sat down and tried to ignore the collective thought bubble that had materialized over the students: Who is this white girl, and what is she doing in our classroom?
This past September, when my friends asked me about the six weeks I had spent teaching summer school in the Chicago Public Schools (CPS), I knew that, in our academic, socially-aware culture, I was supposed to talk about what a wonderful, incredibly rewarding experience it had been.
On that first day back in June, however, I encountered nothing wonderful nor rewarding to speak of.
To put it bluntly, I had been scared shitless.
Not scared of the students themselves, but scared that they wouldn't take me seriously.
Scared that I wouldn't be able to get through to them.
Scared that I would fail.
After spending two semesters in the University of Michigan's School of Education, I had certainly been in front of a classroom of students before – but never like this.
Never had I been faced with the task of teaching a class of thirty-eight students who ranged from grades nine through twelve – all of whom had failed English for one or both semesters of the previous school year.
And never, never in all my middle-class suburban experience, had I been exposed to a group of students who lacked even the most miniscule amount of assumed respect for their teacher.
Deep breaths, I told myself.
You'll get through this.
The Eleanor Roosevelt quote my mom always told me surfaced.
You must do the thing you think you cannot do.
Summer school at John Hope College Prep High School was set up in a way that made it difficult for students to enjoy themselves and learn anything.
The students were forced to sit in one classroom for four hours straight save for one ten-minute break.
In the stifling heat of the Chicago summer, the air conditioning flickered on and off based on the mood of the construction workers at the school.
And Ms. Taylor, my mentor teacher, certainly did nothing to make the students' time worthwhile.
She began each day by writing an agenda (a list of assignments) on the board.
By itself, this was not an unusual practice.
However, most teachers would generally take the time to go over such an agenda with their students – guiding them through the day's activities, showing the students how their daily work related to overarching classroom goals, and answering questions.
Ms. Taylor, on the other hand, felt that her daily agendas were self-explanatory, and so she would remain seated at her desk as the students entered the classroom.
Fire breaks out in Kolín.
Dozens of firefighters arrived on the scene, assisted by a helicopter.
At 14:00 a fire broke out not far from Český Brod in the Kolín region, between Bylany and Liblice, burning approximately 15 hectares.
The fire stopped spreading around 15:15, and the firefighters declared a level three alarm out of a possible four.
According to the firefighter's spokesman Ladislav Holomcík, a helicopter helped to put out the fire from the air.
At 18:00 the firemen managed to extinguish the fire, which caused damages amounting to 700,000 Czech crowns.
Dozens of both professional and volunteer firemen fought the blaze on the spot.
The blaze was caused by a technical defect in the engine compartment of a combine harvester.
A helicopter helped to extinguish it by delivering six loads of water.
"The handed over the site of the incident to the owners, and it will be watched over by a volunteer fire brigade until 8:00 tomorrow," Holomčík said today.
A Becoming Resemblance: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the center of the room at New York's Fridman Gallery are multiple faces - white, black and brown, each bearing an almost imperceptible resemblance to one another - suspended on wires from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the clippings from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after famously leaking classified diplomatic cables through the website WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is titled A Becoming Resemblance.
It's the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combines her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Barack Obama when he had just three days left in office.
By algorithmically analyzing DNA extracted from Manning and using it to create 30 portraits of what someone with that genomic data might look like, Dewey-Hagborg has created a trenchant, if somewhat cerebral, commentary on not only the malleability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted, and the inherent determinism of those interpretations - but also identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman as early as adolescence, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six Espionage Act violations, computer fraud and theft.
From prison, her image was repressed, so much so that there was just one photo - a granular, black-and-white selfie in which Manning, visibly uneasy, sits in a driver's seat wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she became associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was coming off the massive success of her 2012 project, Stranger Visions.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from the detritus to conjure an image of what these folks might look like.
That was when she received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They were conducting an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany that article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't be visited and she couldn't be photographed at that time, so they reached out to Chelsea and asked if she'd be interested in having a DNA portrait made.
The artist and her incarcerated muse became unlikely pen pals, exchanging several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book, Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, that envisioned a future where the president would commute Chelsea's sentence and she'd be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would indeed call for Manning's release just days after the book went public was a welcome sort of serendipity after seven brutal years at a military prison in Kansas.
There's also something profound and powerful about the exhibition opening now, as Donald Trump wages war on government leakers and transgender troops while finding new, tweetable ways to further inflame the stark divisions he's been called on to mend.
When asked about the peculiar timing of it all, Dewey-Hagborg said that "things happen for a reason."
In an artist statement written on the gallery's wall, Manning's super-sized signature below it (the "i" in her last name dotted with a heart), called for an end to the "automatic factionalism that gender, race, sexuality, and culture have been the basis of."
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
By including the 200 letters (or nucleotides, per the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to illustrate how astoundingly similar, at least in biological makeup, we all are.
"What I'm hoping that people will take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are, and how open genetic data is to interpretation, how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on display.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so this is 30 of those stories."
The final piece in the exhibition, which is contained in a single room, is one page from the aforementioned graphic novella.
It shows Manning, emerging, King Kong-esque, from the United States Disiplinary Barracks with a speakerphone in hand.
"When they chill your speech, then they've won," it reads.
"So never shut up."
"It came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," the artist, who hails from Philadelphia, said.
"I get goosebumps still talking about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in-person yet - as was so presciently imagined in the comic book - but when she does, she'll be greeted in the center of the room by the masks, her own genomic simulacra congregated like hordes of protesters.
That was purposeful, too, as is everything in the exhibition, down to the height (5"2, Manning's stature) at which her genetic haplogroups were written in pencil.
"In the past, I've had them on the wall but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind freeing her as well."
Northwestern Professor and Oxford University Employee Wanted for Homicide
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was found fatally stabbed inside a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
On Monday, first-degree murder warrants without bail were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County court records show.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.
A community alert released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officers received a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several lacerations on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead on the scene and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide while police actively search for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the appropriate authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in that investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement that, "We have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigating authorities in any way they need."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to turn himself in.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly encourages the suspects to surrender to authorities.
"Police have an idea of their whereabouts but our efforts to locate that are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager who had just received a cryptic tip that said something had occurred in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very gruesome.
Guglielmi said it is unclear if the incident also occurred on July 27.
Lathem and Warren were confirmed to be at the building by security cameras, he said.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The management team at Grand Plaza released a statement to residents saying, "Police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."

"We'll complete WADA roadmap in near future" - Russian Deputy PM Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said it will not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the reinstatement of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"A certain stage of fulfilling the road map criteria has been carried out, RUSADA obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap was updated in this regard," Mutko stated on Thursday.
The PM was commenting on the second part of WADA's Roadmap to Code Compliance, which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and which recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future," he added.
One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, states that Russian anti-doping authorities must publically accept the reported outcomes of the WADA-sanctioned investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Referring to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation, as our anti-doping system admitted a failure.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programs, and we will not admit something that didn't exist."
Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Talking to Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov admitted past problems in Russian anti-doping bodies, but added: "We have said on numerous occasions, that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was suspended from carrying out doping controls within Russia by WADA in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.
It was, however, permitted to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) this June.
Following a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.

The Ministry of Defence, which has been assigned the role by the government, promises to improve the physical fitness and capabilities of the Czechs, so that they could then be used in crisis situations.
This results from the proposal prepared by the ministry.
Were the law to be adopted in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns to support its defence.
According to its authors, the basic aim of the proposal is to create an effective system that would help to make Czech Republic's population better prepared to defend the state, outside of military duties and on the basis of voluntary activities.
For example, the state would support ham radio, shooting or dog training societies financially or materially, boosting the capabilities of their members.
In return, it would get information about people who are willing to come to the country's aid in times of crisis, and about their abilities or material equipment.
Accredited instructors would also be available to assist the associations and other interested parties in the training or education.
It also includes the organisation of talks with war veterans or people who have acted heroically.
One of the possible options envisage a new office that would be created to administer and coordinate the project.
The authors of the proposal stress that people's participation would be voluntary, and that the state would only use their skills if a state of emergency was declared.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual elimination of the previously clear boundaries between the different types of threats," the proposal states, referring to the danger of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministry clerks noted that it was therefore necessary to focus on supporting the widest possible range of capabilities, and not just military skills.
"The basic aim of the proposal is to create a very broad foundation that will enable every citizen to respond properly in the event of situations that endanger the sovereignty, lives, health or property of individuals, to protect themselves or to contribute to the protection of others, and not to perform the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic," the proposal specifies.
Adopting the law would necessitate considerable financial demands.
The exact amount depend on the option chosen, according to the Ministry.
For example, the department envisages up to 100 million crowns being provided as financial support for projects to prepare citizens to defend the state.
If an administrative and coordination centre were to be established, its operation could cost about 60 million crowns a year.
More money would be required to pay wages or create an IT system.
The proposal also suggests that the regional military headquarters should to expand, employing a total of 42 more soldiers.
Ministry officials previously stated that the law would also help resolve the certain Czech politicians' objections to the introduction of the European Union directive concerning the possession of arms.

Economics of the Illicit-Drug Market
The efficient allocation of resources has always been a significant topic in economics regardless of the context of the particular allocation.
The illicit drug market is no exception.
However, this market exhibits some unique economic qualities that need to be called to attention in order for proper consideration to be given for the allocation of resources to control this market.
Drug use is often blamed for a wide range of personal and social problems including: loss of productivity, diminished health, moral degradation, excessive violence, the spread of disease, and many others.
Accordingly, our policy decisions have reflected our distaste for these consequences, and we have tried to outlaw drug-use altogether.
However, as will be shown, the costs associated with these problems are tremendous, and we must now call into question whether or not current forms of prohibition and resource allocation are an effective and efficient means of attacking these problems.
In particular, a major problem that must be called to the attention of policy makers, and the economists who advise on their behalf, is the observation and recognition of a nearly perfectly inelastic supply of drug offenders-dealers-at the street level.
In other words, the supply of these offenders in the illicit drug market is not sensitive to the price of crime (punishment), but why should this be such a significant problem?
The absolute grandeur of the problem of the inelastic supply of drug offenders at this level is more clearly felt when you take into consideration the immense costs that are being incurred because of this problem.
Specifically, it has been estimated that the direct costs, excluding the opportunity costs, of incarcerating a single person for one year is in the ballpark of $30,000- $40,000, (The Economics of Crime: Lecture Notes, Malone).
These numbers are especially momentous, now, with the realization that the imprisonment of one such member of the illicit drug market, you are, in fact, spending a great deal of resources on something that will undoubtedly have no positive affect, deterrence or otherwise, on the supply of offenders in the market.
This inelasticity can partially be explained by the vertically integrated structure of the illicit drug market, which consequently leads to an extremely competitive market at the street level.
In fact, by the time the market has reached the street level, there are no positive profits to be made in the long run.
Why then, is the supply of offenders at this level so easily renewed?
The answer lies partially with the fact that offenders at this level are typically low-skilled, low-income males, who may deal as a compliment to their legitimate job--or have no desire to acquire a legitimate job-- making them easily replaceable.
However, the most powerful incentive for participation lies in the opportunity to move up the ladder where the more lucrative wages are made.
As said in an article entitled Why Drug Dealers Still Live with Their Moms, from the publication, Freakonomics, criminals, like everyone else, respond to incentives.
So if the prize is big enough, they will form a line down the block just hoping for a chance…[P]eople wanting to sell crack vastly outnumber the available street corners (pg. 105).
Other significant costs associated with this problem have come as a result of past policy decisions attempting to fight the illicit drug problem.
For example, in the 1980's mandatory sentencing on the federal level for crack cocaine offenders was implemented.
Similarly, so-called 3-strike laws were also implemented at the state level to target habitual offenders, so that harsher sentences would be reached.
The start-ups that will help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to gauge employee happiness at her e-commerce start-up, but surveys weren't working.
Responses were often vague, unhelpful or, worse, deceitful.
And even if she promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.
"It just never had consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
So she called in outsiders for help.
A new breed of human resources start-ups is cropping up to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By building and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, they allow companies to do snap polls, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistle-blowers to bypass C-suite executives and go straight to the board of directors.
"You've now got tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where's the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained more insight into what her employees were thinking and feeling in three years using Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and polls of specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company showing at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval scores - allowing her to drill down on why.
Companies are coming to realize they must stay on top of their workplace culture, lest they become the next Uber, which has been enmeshed in scandal since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke out were punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, this desire for oversight is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to finance tech insights website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colo., start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an uptick in interest and activity earlier this year amid Uber's fall into disrepute.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, gather confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of its problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous texting hotline that lets employees report bad behavior.
And if the chief executive is implicated, complaints go straight to the board of directors.
"The court of public opinion has usurped regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and chief executive of Convercent.
If a company is found to treat its employees poorly or behave unethically, even if regulators don't step in, it can face costly consequences from consumer boycotts, employee attrition and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees across 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and offer an easy way to reach its corporate headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for corporate headquarters, lodge a formal complaint, and hope it was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, who said there was no good way of tracking employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, though, problems that were previously hidden from executives who sat in offices cities or states away - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices - can be more quickly identified and addressed.
"I can get closer to that holistic, 360-degree view into the employment experience," said Vitrano, who oversees Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"And we're protecting our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies started taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations from the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it wasn't until "social media came into its own" that companies realized they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from going viral online.
"Prior to using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies recurring fees to use their products.
It's a business model and opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors, who have propped up both start-ups.
Convercent raised $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital raised to $47 million.
Glint secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
These investments hardly come as a surprise, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There's a growing body of research showing today's employees expect more from their workplaces than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are merely table stakes.
Employees want to feel that they're accepted and valued and that they're giving their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be at a company, feel their voices are heard, and that the work they are doing is rewarding, they are more committed to making that company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee commitment and engagement, it's no wonder they're finding backing.
Having data on employee engagement is important, according to workplace culture experts.
But the data are useless unless a company's custodians take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for their feedback, it can set an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change doesn't come fast enough, or at all, it can breed disappointment and make employees disengaged.
"If you're going to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow through, employees will wonder, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?' "
Madison Reed, which now does monthly employee surveys, has been able to take action the same day a problem is reported on Glint, according to Errett.
And, after gathering feedback from employees frustrated by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add communication training to address the issues.
Over at Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insight on its employees, and it's hoping that in the long run, this will convert to better retention of workers in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you're going to lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you're going to lose companies."
Suomi
The must of the old farmhouse seared my nostrils with recollections of a visit from long ago.
I remembered this place, although more than a decade has passed since I was here last.
Memories flashed in my mind of a time when my grandmother was still alive.
I only met her once in my life—yet I still remember the only words she ever spoke to me.
I was sitting on the lap of this unfamiliar old woman that I knew I was supposed to love, even if I was barely nine years old and utterly terrified of her.
My mom stood next to me and translated the foreign but familiar words that spewed from this stranger's mouth.
The conversation was awkward and strained.
My grandmother yearned to communicate with her youngest grandchildren whom she'd only met in pictures and stories.
My little sister, with her big brown eyes, had a look of desperation and anxiety on her face, and I sensed that we shared the same feeling.
We wanted to feel warmth for Mumu, but there wasn't tenderness for a stranger we hardly knew.
She stroked my hair and patted my arm, then turned to my mother and muttered some indecipherable language.
Mumu looked into my eyes as she held me tight on her lap.
With all seriousness—for she knew it might be her only opportunity to reassure my sister and me of this—she said it.
I love you.
Said Mumu.
I love you too, I replied.
But the words came out of my mouth sounding more foreign than Finnish.
I barely recognized it as speech. I said this out of habit, much like I would unwittingly reply to a thank you with an automatic you're welcome.
Mumu died three years later, before I ever had a chance to tell her how I felt in earnest.
I made my decision to go to Finland in late April of this past year and a month later I found myself on a plane headed across the Atlantic Ocean.
I remembered bits and pieces of my prior visit to Finland from when I was eight years old, like playing in the incredible snow drifts near the farmhouse in Iisalmi and creeping through the abandoned barn that once housed cattle but where now only the eerie odor of barnyard animals remained.
Last time I'd been there it was dark winter, but this time it was bright summer.
Driving down the highway from the airport to my uncle's house seemed familiar.
As a young girl, I can still remember looking up and out the window and seeing the hanging cliffs, remnants of the last ice age, on either side of the road and feeling like I was still in Michigan.
Yet now, as a young woman I peered out the car at these ancient walls once again and feelings of the arctic overwhelmed me.
The dark and bare cliffs, although no more than thirty feet tall, exuded strength, sagacity, and age.
White birch trees dotted the flat terrain, while occasional daring pines desperately clung to life on the cliffs.
Later that day my aunt took me to the Finnish Lotta museum.
Named after the woman who started the organizations, the Lottas were female nurses who served in the First and Second World Wars and cared for the wounded Finnish soldiers on the battlefield and in the safe confines of the forest.
As we walked through the museum, my aunt asked me questions about the Lottas, seeking to pick my brain of any prior knowledge stored in the recesses of my mind.
Thursday becomes the hottest day
On Thursday, temperatures of 38.3 degrees were recorded in Strážnice in Hodonín, making it the hottest day of the year in the Czech Republic.
It surpassed Tuesday, which had previously been the hottest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
The announcement was made by the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
Elsewhere, however, many of the temperature records set on Tuesday did not fall on Thursday.
The heatwave mainly affected Moravia, while in Bohemia it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, records were beaten or matched in 35 of the 145 meteorological stations, which have been measuring the weather for over 30 years.
Only nine long-term measuring stations saw new records set on Thursday.
For example, in Strážnice the temperature during the day was the same as the previous record set in 2013.
In Lednice, near Břeclav, the day time temperature reached 37.4 degrees, surpassing the original maximum by four tenths of a degree, and in Pohořelice near Brno the current temperature of 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records was last broken in 2013, like in Strážnice.
The high temperatures mainly occurred in the south and east of Moravia.
After Straznice, the biggest heat was in Dyjakovice, near Znojmo, and Brod nad Dyje, near Břeclav, where the mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not beat the record.
On the other hand, according to the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute (ČHMÚ), the highest daytime temperatures in western and northwest Bohemia were only about 22 degrees Celsius.
"Temperatures started growing there later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
According to the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute (ČHMÚ), the current heat in the Czech Republic will fade erode and there could be heavy rain on Sunday.
However, temperatures in Moravia will mostly remain high on Friday, and also on Saturday in the southeast of Moravia.
A malady has spread here.
It isn't enough for billionaires to have the same voice as other mere legal adults in the country during elections.
They want to adjudicate directly, and because not all of them are as bold as Andrel Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
Along with other colleagues behind Martin Burda and Antonín Fryč, Penta owner Marek Dospiva sponsors Robejšek's Realisty.
The second life of the Občanské demokratické aliance (Civic Democratic Alliance) is funded by insurance company owner and real estate entrepreneur Pavel Sehnal, who is also its chairman
Convicted corrupter and Czech gambling king Ivo Valenta bought up the Strana soukromníků (Freeholder Party).
The Agrofert political movement, as the project by Andrej Babiš unintentionally named by the Mayor of Kroměříž Jaroslav Němec, deserves a whole chapter for itself.
The Starostové a nezávislí (Mayors and Independents - STAN) recently acquired their own billionaire.
The man in question is Dalibor Dědek, owner of the security equipment company Jablotron.
In his own words, he entered politics to do good.
Dědek's entrance in mayoral colours did not get off to a good start, however.
"I never dreamed of small targets," he said at a press conference.
Which is to say that my goal is for the ANO movement, the Starostové movement to get 20 percent in the elections.
Various people smiled to themselves.
Dědek's slip of the tongue is rather symptomatic, however.
Millionaire Dalibor Dědek is a man of strong opinions.
Although he intends to run for election for the Starostové, he continues to support Andrej Babiš.
Dědek supported Babiš in the last parliamentary elections.
"Babiš is not a seasoned speaker and cannot handle the lively rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote about him before the 2013 elections.
He certainly is not going into politics because he wants to improve himself personally.
Babiš will remain a hero to me.
He is willing to step out of his world, which he has under control, and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Starostové introduced him as a new reinforcement, he professed his admiration for Babiš once again.
He said he wanted the Starostové to learn to imagine a possible collaboration with Babiš.
Some people may appreciate the fact that Dědek sticks to his opinions and stands up for himself, no matter what team colours he is wearing.
Others may speculate whether Babiš is sending someone so awkward to the Starostové to create a second rate version.
Others still may ask whether the boss of Jablotron parted ways from the boss of Agrofert as part of a bad business deal, and is now looking for another way to defend himself against his business rival.
Dědek's first public appearances did not all revolve around Babiš, however.
Dědek promised to send the Starostové ten million crowns for the campaign.
And when they say they need more money, he will send more.
A few years ago, it would have been very hard for someone to take exception to such a statement.
Indeed, before the 2010 elections the legally recognised crook Zdeněk Bakala gave away millions to all the parties.
The political division of Vit Bárta's security agency, TOP 09, and the Civic Democrats came together for nearly thirty million.
We are now living in different times, however.
The law forbids anyone to give more than three million to a political party.
When Dědek entered politics, he could at least have studied the rules of the game.
Perhaps then he would not have had to ask why politics has such a bad reputation in our country.
Dědek's first days in politics were topped off with a proposal to give tax benefits to families with children who are studying.
People with a university education earn about 50,000 crowns per month in our country.
Those with only basic education earn less than 20,000.
Someone earning 50,000 is rich under the local conditions.
Those earning 20,000 are poor.
In Dědek's view, the poor pay taxes fairly, and the rich should enjoy the benefits of the welfare state, in which they participate very little.
In short, rich people must be helped so that they do not have to face poverty.
The Starostové can congratulate themselves for their new acquisition and Babis is rubbing his hands.
Thanks to Dědek, the rest of us can confirm the fact that billionaires are not good people.
The question remains of who to vote for.
To my mind, it should be those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
It should be the people who don't employ their own party members or citizens of the state and who don't own parts of the country.
Finally, it should be the people who want everyone to live well in a rich country, and not just the few.
Plato and Hellenistic Poetics:
A Study of Narratological Framing
One of the finest examples of framed narrative in literature is Catullus 64.
It possesses such a dazzlingly intricate narrative that a reader is practically compelled to carefully consider its structure.
Delicately woven layers of narrative function as a series of frames.
With these frames the narrator directs a reader's attention from the voyage of the Argo, to the meeting of Peleus and Thetis and their eventual wedding, and then to the coverlet that adorns their marriage bed.
Here the narrator launches into an ekphrasis of the coverlet, which depicts the weeping Ariadne, and includes a lengthy account of the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur, of which the central part Ariadne's lament over Theseus' infidelity.
The focus of the narrative then returns to the marriage of Peleus and Thetis, where we hear the epithalamium of the Parcae.
The subject of the song is Achilles, the future offspring of the newlywed couple, and thus the song within a song itself frames the myth of the Trojan War.
This brief summary of Catullus 64 serves as an excellent starting point for a discussion of framing as practiced by Hellenistic and later poets, because in many ways the poem represents the full maturation, the zenith, of framing as narrative structure.
A brief look at the history of Greek literature reveals that since Homer, framing was virtually a standard and accepted method of presenting a story.
One need only consider the Odyssey, in which many occurrences of the technique can be noted, the most obvious being in Book IX, when Odysseus recounts his wanderings to Alcinous.
The Iliad and the Odyssey themselves are presented in a very defined framework, each being an account of a relatively brief span of time set against the understood backdrop of a larger event, the Trojan war.
One observes a great deal of framing in lyric poetry as well, particularly in Pindar, whose style, as Gildersleeve noted over a century ago, is marked by overlapping parallels and the dexterous use of foils, features that are established almost invariably by framed mythological references.
A specific example would be the myth of Pelops that is embedded into Olympian I.
Later, we encounter Plato, perhaps the supreme example of an author who utilized framing to structure his narrative.
The dialogue form is intrinsically a sort of frame, which separates the reader of the narrative from the author by at least one degree (or several, as is the case in the Symposium).
This short history demonstrates that framing can be distinguished as a consistent narrative technique in Greek literature, and was utilized consciously from Homer onwards.
This may seem like an absurdly obvious assertion to make, however conscious is the operative word.
The importance of the conscious aspect of framing cannot be overstated because the maturation of framing as a technique in Greek literature consisted of an advancing degree of consciousness, or rather perhaps self-consciousness, on the part of the authors.
For this reason one witnesses in Catullus 64 the poet taking the trope of the frame to such an extreme that it moves beyond being a mere structural edifice and becomes a key feature in determining the meaning of a poem.
Framing in earlier Greek poetry, for example in Homer, generally provides nothing more than an occasion for a story.
Framing in Catullus and other Latin poets is an intricate and self-reflective process which has the effect of bringing the narrative structure of a poem to the forefront of a reader’s consideration.
The purpose of this paper is essentially to examine what sort of changes took place in the intervening centuries to effect such an evolution.
Language Lesson Plan
1. Goals
Originally, I had intended to do a lesson plan in German for students of English, but on further reflection, I decided that for this project it would be better for understanding if I tried a slightly adapted version of the lesson for students of English as a second language in America.
My target age group would be high school-aged students at a beginner English-learning level, primarily because I will be teaching using the content-based method, and that is an age at which my chosen school subject, geography, is still taught and can therefore be more useful.
The goal then of this lesson is to impart some knowledge of the subject of geography to students of ESL.
Students should learn and be able to use basic vocabulary involving directions and should be familiarized with the location of the different states in the US.
I am planning for a class with around twenty to thirty students with several different first languages and varying degrees of beginner English skills.
2. Objectives
The terminal objective of this lesson will be for the students to become familiar with what each of the states looks like and be able to identify them on a map.
They should also be able to make statements about the location of a state alone or in relation to another state.
This type of lesson is common in most American grade school systems today and will allow the students to learn more about the country in which they are now living.
Enabling objectives for the lesson will include learning directions (north, south, eastern from, western from, etc.) and practicing using exercises designed to aid in memorization of terms and locations.
Students will also be expected to review the lesson as homework.
3. Materials and Equipment
The materials involved will be handouts, power point, a blackboard, and a blank map to be filled out as homework (Appendix D).
The handouts will include maps of the United States (Appendix A), a list of the different directions and their attributes (Appendix B), and an exercise involving the directions (Appendix C), while the power point will be used to supplement the handouts.
I would write important phrases on the blackboard to aid the students in understanding the lesson.
The blank map will be given out at the end of class, at which time the students will be told that the test in this course will include some of the aspects of the map and that they should practice by filling it out (with the help of another map if necessary).
4. Procedures/Activities
If this is the first class, I might introduce myself and have the students each say their names in the traditional my name is ____ format.
Then I would give the first handout (Appendix A) out and go over the state names, instructing the students in the pronunciation of the harder ones.
My power point would always simply be a larger replica of what I had given the students, so I would be able to demonstrate as well as answer questions using that tool.
After pointing to state names and having the students practice saying them aloud for a while, I would give out the second handout (Appendix B) and introduce the concept of directions.
Once we had clearly defined each term and reviewed its uses and answered any questions, I would move on to some simple sentences involving the locations of the states.
Some sample sentences might be as follows:
Utah is in the West.
California is found in the West.
Florida is southeast of Montana.
The students would again answer as a group, filling in the pauses when I spoke.
Nobody wanted Trump's paradise.
He had to reduce the price of his villa complex by 234 million.
Selling real estate isn't always easy.
Often, it isn't even helped by having 11 bedrooms and a wonderful view of the sea, or by the fact that the property is being sold by US President Donald Trump.
When selling the Le Chateau des Palmiers villa complex, the price had to be reduced by a staggering £8 million.
The Mirror.co.uk reported on the sale.
The brochure describing the lots states: "Sincerely, Donald J. Trump."
You missed out on a place like no other.
But not even a connection between the the real estate company and the US president could support an extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to slash the price of his Caribbean home by an incredible £8 million.
The original price of the property was £21.5 million, but the final price dropped to £13 million.
Even after the discount, the price of the villa complex is equivalent to about 76 average apartments in the centre of Prague.
And no wonder.
It consists of amazing 5-acre estate on the Caribbean island of St. Martin, with 12 fully equipped bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, numerous dining rooms, a gym and other rooms.
It includes several buildings.
Part of the property has a swimming pool and a tennis court.
There are dozens of palms planted on the plot.
There is a wonderful view of the sea from the terrace.
According to real estate experts, the price reflected the fact that the connection with the president is not enough to attract potential buyers.
Now the estate is closer to normal property prices on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
According to speculations, he is thought to have paid about £15 million.

The NCAA's elimination of two-a-day practices makes for a long day for the Bruins
It's pushing 11 p.m. as a throng of UCLA football players linger to chat on one side of the team's new on-campus practice fields.
Some have peeled off their jersey tops, revealing backs slick with sweat from the toil of the first day of training camp.
For a good chunk of the team, these idle minutes constitute a midday break.
Players enrolled in summer classes will head back to their dorms after the three-hour practice to study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6:30 the following morning.
"This is a grind for these guys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said not long before Monday turned into Tuesday.
The NCAA's elimination of two-a-day practices, designed to lighten the load on players, has actually lengthened their days - at least until finals end Friday.
That's why UCLA's first three practices were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate players' already crammed schedules.
The trade-off from no two-a-days is more one-a-days, the Bruins pushing up the start of camp nearly a week from last season and holding practices during summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 practices through Aug. 20 before beginning formal game preparations for their opener against Texas A&M on Sept.
Mora said he supported the NCAA's rule change even if it did add another item to players' busy itineraries.
"We're putting this enormous load on them for three or four days and it's very challenging," Mora said.
"And they've just pushed through it; they grind, they're great kids.
I think once we get to Saturday and we'll have more time, it will really be great."
UCLA will close its practices once camp is finished, no easy task given the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjoining Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been pelted with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a goalpost.
Bruins players are scheduled to occupy the hotel beginning this weekend, but Mora acknowledged that there could be an issue once those rooms are vacant during the season.
"We will have security," Mora said.
"That is a real concern and it's not far-fetched to think that people can rent a room and sit up there and videotape a practice.
If you have videotape of a practice, it's a pretty good deal.
But we'll have security there and we'll have security up in Parking Lot 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we got.
I'm not going to worry too much about it.
We have a plan in place."
Improving Process Flow in The Oasis and Integrating A New Deli
Introduction
The Oasis, an entertainment complex in Funton, is facing flow problems at the ticketing and concession areas.
You believe that customers wait too long in lines, creating displeasure, and that these lines of customers cause congestion at the entrance to the complex, making the complex unattractive to entering customers.
Also, a new water park will soon be opened across town, and you believe that it may draw some customers away from The Oasis.
Hence, you decided to acquire the delicatessen adjacent to The Oasis to expand the business, and you now need to efficiently integrate it into the complex.
Therefore, you wanted to know how to change the indoor layout, improve services and customer flow, and efficiently integrate the deli, so that your customers may relax and have fun without spending time waiting in lines.
Our team at EnginPlans will gather available information to examine the current operations, flow, and layout in The Oasis and in the deli.
We will analyze them, develop two recommended layouts for The Oasis, and propose changes in signage, employee reallocation and operating structure to improve services and customer flow.
We will also develop an integrated plan detailing how the deli will be efficiently merged into the current operations, including two proposed layouts for the deli.
This proposal presents our plan for this project, including a detailed action plan and timeline.
Background
The Oasis is an entertainment complex in Funton, owned by you, under the title of Oasis Properties.
To stay above upcoming competition from a new water park to be opened soon across town, you decided to purchase Lunch-in, a deli adjacent to the complex.
However, both of these facilities are currently facing process flow problems.
Tickets for all attractions in the complex are only available at the entrance, and there are no clear directions where to go.
Thus customers to the Oasis face long queue wait times, congestion and confusion at the entrance.
At the deli, there are no directions about forming lines, the seating layout is disorganized, while the ice cream and sandwiches are sold at a separate counters.
Thus, customers to the deli face several inconveniences such as disorderly lines, a lack of clear walkways, and having to pay at multiple payment booths.
The Oasis is intended to be a place offering exciting entertainment options and a place to spend the afternoon or evening.
Customers should be relaxing and having fun rather than spending their time in lines.
Thus, operations in the complex must be efficient and customer-friendly.
To do so, you want to solve the current flow problems, integrate the deli into The Oasis, and make the new integrated complex efficient.
Goals and Objectives
The primary goals of this project are to reduce congestion, confusion and wait times at ticketing counters and the deli, and to integrate the new deli into The Oasis in an efficient and appealing manner.
This is to allow customers to relax and have fun without spending time waiting in lines.
To achieve these goals, our team will first determine the current state of congestion, wait times, and customer satisfaction, examine the flow and layout at The Oasis and the deli.
With this information, we will develop recommendations, which may include:
Decentralizing the centers of activity in the complex.
Establishing a simple, comprehensible flow for customers, with signage.
Reassigning employees to different tasks.
Designing two efficient layouts for The Oasis.
Designing two efficient layouts for the deli, with added seating capacity.
Developing and regulating an efficient customer flow system in the deli.
Simulating these changes on Pro Model to estimate the reduction in customer wait times.

Otherness and Englishness in late medieval pilgrimage guides
Wednesday, the vj Day of Januarii, the wynde Rose ayens us, with grett tempest, thonnderyng and lyghtnyng all Day and all nyght…
And thane we putt us all in the Mercy of god, being in grett peyne and woo both Day and nyght, voowyng sum of vs pylgrymages to our blyssyd lady of Lorett in ytalya, and sum to our lady of Walsyngham, and sum to Seynt Thomas of Cannterbury, we that war englysshmen.
This vivid description of a storm at sea during a 1517 pilgrimage to Jerusalem reveals the dangers of late medieval travel, and the reliance, even at this late date and by an Englishman, on the power of the saints to protect those in danger.
Sixteenth century English readers of this account, however, might have read it not only for its practical advice and depictions of thrilling adventures, but as a tool to construct their own meditations on the Holy Land.
Why, both these readers and modern scholars might ask, does the author, Sir Richard Torkington, tell us that we that war englysshmen prayed in a different fashion? As Torkington’s narrative indicates, English people traveling abroad negotiated not only the lands they journeyed through, but also their own identity as English.
With their rather unpoetical lists of currency exchanges and mileages, and equally businesslike lists of indulgences, pilgrimage narratives have often been derided by modern scholars: one literary historian, for example, called them the sadly degenerated offspring of earlier, more skillfully written accounts, calling the latter books lifeless and depersonalized.
Guidebooks seem to lack the emotional resonance of better-known accounts; they have neither Margery Kempe’s lively authorial vision, nor John Mandeville’s wild imaginative fancies.
These compendiums of practical advice can be read for a deeper understanding of how the majority of medieval pilgrims defined themselves in relation to the people they met and the landscapes they moved through.
Pilgrimage guides reveal not only the conditions of late medieval travel, but the condition of late medieval travelers: how they were expected to behave, how they encountered foreigners, and, in these English guidebooks, how they moved through Jerusalem as English people.
This movement to and through Jerusalem could be made in the form of a physical pilgrimage, but it could also be enacted through a meditative imagined pilgrimage.
Pilgrim guidebooks have not often been considered in this light because of their merely practical nature.
This paper will argue that these lists, phrasebooks, and warnings were instrumental in allowing readers to recreate the visceral experience of the Jerusalem pilgrimage.
Furthermore, it will argue that these English guidebooks constructed a pilgrimage experience that was particularly English, and that both shaped and was shaped by ideas of national identity.
The ultimate goal for a Christian pilgrim was Jerusalem, the place where Christ was manifest in human form and worked his miracles on earth.
Some 526 Western European pilgrimage accounts written between 1100 and 1500 survive, and the vast majority concern the Jerusalem pilgrimage.
This paper will examine four accounts: the collected itineraries of William Wey from his pilgrimages of 1458 and 1462, an anonymous author’s Informacon for pylgrymes unto the Holy Londe, dated c. 1498, the account by an anonymous chaplain of Sir Richard Guylforde of a pilgrimage of 1506, and the 1517 narrative by Sir Richard Torkington.
All were written by Englishmen, and all were written in a period when both religious practice and England’s relationship to the Holy Land were changing.
This paper will also compare these guidebooks to other approaches to mediating travel through the Holy Land by briefly considering the 1438 pilgrimage narrative of Margery Kempe, and the late fifteenth century map that has been associated with the Itineraries of William Wey.
Literature Review on the Impact of Institutional Reforms on Electoral Corruption
Abueva, head of the Citizen's Movement for a Federal Philippines (CMFP), is calling for change.
Our obsolete form of government and dysfunctional political parties sustain our politics of personality, patronage, cronyism and corruption without public accountability, he writes in Charter Change for Good Governance (Abueva 2005, 3).
He and other supporters of a Philippine Charter Change (commonly referred to as cha-cha), assert that adopting a federal-parliamentary system in place of the traditional unitary-presidential system will help address the Philippines' fundamental problems (Abueva 2005, 33-38).
But are they correct?
Are cha-cha supporters justified in believing that overhauling their country's electoral system will solve its problems of corruption?
I will explore the validity of their claim with particular focus on answering the question: to what extent can a country's electoral methods temper the effects of public office corruption?
I will center my analysis on the consequences of possible electoral reform in the Philippines—a switch from a majoritarian system to closed-list proportional representation—and its potential impact on vote buying.
Vote buying involves the individual immediate and private exchange of goods services, or cash for electoral support, usually in violation of legal norms (Hicken, "How do Rules…, 51).
Although corruption has many forms, I will focus on its manifestation in the political arena, public offices in particular.
In the context of this paper, corruption is defined generally as the misuse of public power, office or authority for private benefit—through bribery, extortion, influence, peddling, nepotism, fraud and embezzlement (United Nations Development Programme, Fighting Corruption to Improve Governance).
Although corruption is a serious and well known problem in the Philippines, and indeed in many countries around the world, measuring it is extremely challenging (Morató 2007, personal email).
Thus, in addition to the challenge of determining appropriate electoral, one must also investigate proper techniques of corruption measurement.
The literature on comparative parties and elections offers insights into the possible motivations for candidates to engage in vote buying strategies.
Differing electoral systems promote contrasting tactics for candidates to win elections.
In certain systems candidates rely mainly on personal reputation and individually focused campaigns to gain voter support.
Such systems are often characterized by intra-party competition, which occurs when members of the same party (copartisans) must campaign against each other within the same district (Hicken, "How do Rules…, 49).
In other systems, candidates depend on the label of their political party rather than their own status, opting to separate themselves from their competitors through partisan differences.
These systems typically portray inter-party competition since the party's label and reputation constitute the key currency for candidates (Hicken, "How do Rules…, 48).
Ultimately, the extent to which a country's electoral rules encourage inter versus intra party competition plays a large role in determining the incentives to engage in electoral corruption.
In his discussion of the effectiveness of institutional reforms on electoral corruption, Allen Hicken identifies strong incentives to cultivate a personal vote (a feature distinctive to intra-party competition) as a key factor in facilitating vote buying strategies (Hicken 2007, How do Rules…, 48-49).
Candidates adopt differing election tactics to suit their institutional and political environment.
Because vote buying is a useful approach in garnering personal votes, it is more likely to occur in countries with extremely personalized electoral and party systems and less likely in countries where parties are stronger and party labels are more valuable to voters and candidates (Hicken 2007, "How Effective are…, 146).
Systems that promote intra-party competition and personal vote cultivation include single-non-transferable vote (SNTV) and open list proportional representation (Hicken 2007, “How Effective are…, 147).
In addition to vote buying, candidates may also cultivate personal votes by calling attention to policy or factional differences within their party.
Such a strategy often leads to fighting between copartisans, which further undermines party cohesion and dilutes the value of the party label (Hicken, "How do Rules…, 50).
In order to bypass this dilemma, party leaders allow or encourage candidates to cultivate personal support networks by directing (or promising to direct) pork…to a candidate's constituents (Hicken, "How do Rules…, 50).
Pork barrel relates to the promise of particularistic forms of government largesse to a candidate's constituents (Hicken, “How do Rules…, 50).
NECKING AND LOCALIZATION IN PLANE STRESS / STRAIN
INTRODUCTION
The development of necking and localization in specimens subjected to a uniaxial tensile load are triggered by a bifurcation.
This bifurcation occurs when a critical load is reached where the displacement path becomes unstable.
Necking and its subsequent phenomena localization show the mechanics behind material and geometric non-linearities.
These non-linearities which can make a specimen decrease in cross sectional area (necking), can induce strain localization at later stages.
Specifically, necking occurs due to geometric non-linearities and localization occurs due to material non-linearities.
This report contains implicit finite element analysis of models with plane stress and plane strain elements, and of different materials.
Two materials were used, an elasto-plastic and hyper-elastic material, to analyze their effect on necking and localization.
The first part of this report contains some explanations about what bifurcation, necking, and localization is and the second part discusses the results of the analysis.
BIFURCATION
Bifurcation is defined as the loss of uniqueness of solution in a non linear problem.
It corresponds to a sudden change in behavior when a critical load parameter (λc) is reached.
In buckling or necking the bifurcation point is defined as the point when a compressive or tensile load reaches a maximum triggering a sudden change in displacement.
Figure 1 shows the bifurcation paths for buckling (red) and necking (green).
As the load increases from zero both paths are stable with displacements close to zero.
The mathematical theoretical solution states that the load will increase with zero displacement until λc is reached (yellow solid line).
In real life because of imperfections and in finite element because of approximations there will always be some displacement before the critical load is reached.
This can be observed in the initial solid red and green lines.
Once λc is attained, the paths will bifurcate into non unique solutions.
The buckling path will become stable while that of necking will become unstable.
Ahead the finite element results are presented which excellently capture this behavior.
This reports aims to analyze two different bifurcation phenomena's.
The first one is necking which depending on the material used might lead to the second bifurcation phenomena, strain localization.
Necking:
Necking occurs due to geometric non-linearities and can be observed as a decrease in cross-sectional area of a specimen under tensile load.
If a specimen is loaded in tension as seen in Figure 2 it will undergo three stages that will culminate with necking.
First, the behavior will be stable with a constant decrease in cross sectional area throughout the length of the specimen.
When the critical load is reached bifurcation occurs and the center of the specimen will neck.
In order to see this complete behavior the sides of the specimen must be under shear free boundary conditions (i.e. rollers on both edges).
Facebook to step up fact-checking in fight against fake news
Facebook is to send more potential hoax articles to third-party fact checkers and show their findings below the original post, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday as it tries to fight so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes and send them to fact checkers, potentially showing fact-checking results under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as being one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many think influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue has also become a big political topic in Europe, with French voters deluged with false stories ahead of the presidential election in May and Germany backing a plan to fine social media networks if they fail to remove hateful postings promptly, ahead of elections there in September.
On Thursday Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking feature was being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing which stories are disputed by third-party fact checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, Facebook news feed product manager, in a blog.
She added that Facebook would keep testing its "related article" feature and work on other changes to its news feed to cut down on false news.
The American Landscape: A Personal Reflection From a Bike Seat
The real American landscape is a face of almost incomprehensible depth and complexity.
If one were to sit for a few days, for example, among the ponderosa pine forests and black lava fields of the Cascade Mountains in western Oregon…and then were to step off to the Olympic Peninsula in Washington, to those rain forests with sphagnum moss floors soft as fleece underfoot…and then head south to walk the ephemeral creeks and sun-blistered playas of the Mojave Desert in Southern California, one would be reeling under the sensations (Lopez, 131).
As a society, Americans stay separate from nature in virtually every way possible.
We live in climate-controlled houses, often venturing into the outdoors only a couple feet to get into cars where we then turn on the heat or air-conditioning.
Few of us live in areas that have not been significantly altered by human intervention, either by urbanization, suburban sprawl, agriculture or industry.
In many areas, the wildlife present is limited to a smattering of squirrels, deer and some birds; in some places the only animals to be found are pigeons.
I always knew that I enjoyed being in nature, but for most of my life that experience was limited to walks in the park, day hikes, camping in the less-than-remote woods on Martha's Vineyard, and one family vacation camping out west.
I was lucky enough to grow up two blocks from Rock Creek Park – an urban natural area more than twice the size of Central Park that spans the District of Colombia and metropolitan Maryland and Virginia.
This area, however, is far from what anyone would consider wild or wilderness.
Two years ago, I decided to join a group of young adults who were biking across the United States to raise funds and awareness for affordable housing.
When I decided to bike across the country I was not a cyclist, but I held a firm belief in the cause we were championing.
I also felt a strong personal desire to see the rest of the country on a deeper, besides the East Coast with which I was quite familiar.
I was not aware yet of just how wide-ranging the landscapes I would experience would be; the pictures I had in my mind were rather stereotyped views of either plains or mountains.
My group started our trip in Providence, Rhode Island and would eventually end up in Seattle, Washington.
On the way we would cross thirteen states: Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, Wyoming, Idaho, Montana and Washington.
Although most of our days were spent biking from town to town, holding informational meetings about the affordable housing issue and meeting as many people as possible, we also took several days off to work on Habitat for Humanity build sites, in order to also have a hands-on influence.
At the beginning of our trip, my approach to each day was consistent with how it was on a daily basis; for instance, I was still used to being in air conditioning during the hot summer days.
I resented the variable weather that could leave us either hot and sweaty or soaking wet and cold.
I was not used to waking up at six in the morning and being physically active for at least six hours a day.
The beginning of the journey was purely about me getting in shape and in touch with my body again – I had not ever had to rely on my own physical strength like this.
I begrudged the often-difficult terrain that I was not physically or mentally prepared to bike over day after day.
But slowly, around the second week, I noticed a difference in my approach to the whole process of biking an average of seventy or eighty miles a day.
I began to wake up excited for the challenge of experiencing new terrain, curious about how the weather would influence my experience of the day, and excited to learn about new towns and people.
One of the first new things I began to notice was not about the natural world around me, but about the immediate environment that I usually took for granted while driving around in a car, that now greatly affected the ease and enjoyment of biking – the quality and condition of the roads.
I became acutely aware of the size and quality of the shoulder – or whether it even existed, in some places.
I noticed whether the roads were smooth or jointed at short intervals, resulting in a bumpy ride.
Most prominent in my mind, though unexpected, was my awareness of the difference that rumble strips make – as annoying as they can be when driven over in a car, they are actually painful when you have to ride over them on a bike.
Though somewhat trivial, this was one of the many things I had always taken for granted about my surroundings, but made a great difference when I was actually out experiencing the world first-hand.
One day in particular stands out in my mind – we were biking in Pennsylvania, from the tiny town of Towanda to Wellsboro.
Building a graphic novel: A Castle in England's story
In its recent past, the diminutive Scotney Castle has featured in a Squeeze music video and been a bolthole for Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has witnessed 700 years of tumultuous history from its cosy seat in Bewl River valley in Kent, now inspiration for a graphic novel written by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
"What a personal connection, to hold that letter in my hand."
Spanning the middle ages to the Edwardian era, A Castle in England documents the families that lived in Scotney, with each story illustrated by a different, upcoming UK artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not Rhodes's first book based on an archive: he also wrote 2014's Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I welled up at just the thumbprint on the side of a letter, written by a double agent in the 1700s who was working for the Jacobites," he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke because, back then, you lit a fire for light.
To someone 300 years in the future, the smell makes it feel like they're there, too.
Ah, I love archives!"
For someone so smitten with old papers, getting support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and living in a castle for almost four months ("I overstayed my welcome a little bit, to be honest") seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, going through the archives and studying the manor's many treasures and curios, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the moat.
He wandered the grounds and the ruins of the old castle, talking to rangers, gardeners and sometimes the artists at work on his book's illustrations.
Then at night, he'd "drink whiskey and get writing."
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust had only gained full access in 2006 when the final heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, staff were only starting to tackle the archive, which he describes as "hundreds of years of aristocrats going: 'Oh, stick it in the loft'."
Diaries, letters from the days of the English empire, maps outlining who owned what: "You'd think land disputes would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was this one birch tree two families were fighting over.
Just let it go, guys!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a jumping-off point to delve more broadly into English history, including The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 Peasants' Revolt.
"There is a record of a riot happening at the castle in 1380, in this book called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," says Rhodes.
"The Peasants' Revolt started in that area and I thought, a riot is a good place to start.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are rooted firmly in the history of the castle - such as The Priest, which tells the tale of the Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, which features 18th-century contrabander Arthur Darrell, who is thought to have staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with rocks (a discovery made years later when his coffin was unearthed).
The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite Scotney family: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite roguish, always getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Different generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of handsome guys, with a knack for wooing heiresses."

We Will Both Praise it Now: A discussion on History, Memory, and the voices who sing of both
Personal interpretations of past time—the stories that people tell themselves in order to explain how they got to the place they currently inhabit—are often in deep and ambiguous conflict with the official interpretative devices of a culture.
Carolyn Kay Steedman, Landscape for a Good Woman
It has been said that history is written by the winners.
Indeed, as Walter Benjamin says, Whoever has emerged victorious participates to this day in the triumphal procession in which present rulers step over those who are lying prostrate (Illuminations, 256).
But what of the memories of those who lived through the historical events?
Before the appearance, or more specifically the study of, postcolonial literature, the stories of indigenous peoples were told by the conquerors and explorers: D.H.
Lawrence, Leonard Woolf, and Daniel Defoe.
It could perhaps then be inferred that history is a Western theory or recalling the past, while memory is a non-Western method of remembering the past.
The emergence of memory as a category of academic discourse is then a healthy result of decolonization (Klein 135).
Indeed, the declaration of history and memory as not being polar opposites has become one of the clichés of the school of thought.
Memory is replacing old stand-bys such as nature, culture, and language, as the term most usually coupled with history and that shift is remaking historical imagination (Klein 128).
History, as with other key terms, finds its meaning largely through its counter concepts like the future as well as its synonyms the past and thus the emergence of memory seeks to redefine the boundaries of histories.
Here, two authors who have broken the boundaries between history and memory in postcolonial literature will be discussed:
Derek Walcott’s Omeros and J.M Coetzee’s Waiting for the Barbarians.
Walcott and Coetzee depict very different places in very different ways;
Walcott describes the mythical history of St. Lucia through multiple voices and experiences, while Coetzee describes the confessional memoir of a single man in an abstract place.
Yet both authors aim to do the same thing: to insert their characters’ memories into broader historical contexts, while at the same time allowing their characters to forget pieces of the past.
Walcott’s Omeros has been discussed as the juxtaposition between history and myth of the Caribbean island of St. Lucia.
To do so is to aptly represent a colonized, decolonized, and postcolonized nation whose history is amalgamation of colonial histography and cultural memory.
Instead of privileging one over the other, Walcott rather utilizes both historical and mythical modes of representation precisely in order to foreground the way in which one discourse relies upon and cancels out the other (Williams 277).
Walcott abstracts the Caribbean island into mythical proportions by creating a labyrinth of memories, histories, and identities.
He translates the single landscape of St. Lucia by repeatedly redefining through different people’s perspectives.
Walcott seeks to step analytically sideways, to see the landscape of St. Lucia (literally and metaphorically) from a different angle, to see the life events of Helen, Achilles, Hector, and Plunkett not as trivial or isolated, but significant and necessary to History.
At the same time he resists being a part of History.
Walcott does not feature a central protagonist, but rather allows the maintenance of a wider interpretation through a chorus of different voices, albeit different experiences.
He must negotiate the memories and histories of his characters as well as national identities such as British (the Empire), Greek (the literary tradition), and Aruac (the native culture): where Ogun can fire one with his partner Zeus (Walcott 53).
In short, the multiplicity of Omeros is a hybridist cultural exercise.
That measure could compel Taipei's growing number of small video-viewing parlors to pay movie producers for showing their films.

National Identity and Language Education Policy
Regardless of ideological leanings, most Americans agree that education is a hugely important factor that impacts not only democratic civic participation, but also social mobility and economic growth.
Education is taken seriously as an integral part of the American Dream, and public education policy has always been a hotly contentious issue.
People feel strongly about education and the effects of educational policy on their kids and their country; thus, education is an area that has traditionally been as closely linked as possible with the people, governed in large part by state and local governments.
The education of immigrant children is an area of education policy that has been even more controversial than most, with its various contending programs and arguments over discrimination, inclusion, language rights, identity politics, assimilation and civil rights.
It is a debate both at the federal level and at the individual state and local levels of government.
Although almost everyone, immigrant or not, would agree that learning English is important to succeed, not much of the legislation passed by state and federal governments actually assists immigrants in their language learning or in researching and creating better methods and programs for language learning.
This failure to provide for language education prevents many immigrant children from having any meaningful education.
Paradoxically, although language policy and education policy often has stated goals of helping immigrants to succeed by acquiring English as the key to unlocking the opportunity of America (Bush, Online News Hour), it often does nothing to actually provide for learning English.
Thus, by acknowledging English to be necessary to success and failing to provide English education, language and education legislation often effectively bars immigrant students from success by denying them the educational resources they need.
School is one of the places where assimilation into the American melting-pot is supposed to happen.
Language policy and education clearly shows that for now, this so-called melting-pot society is actually a coercive assimilation, where established Americans insist on newcomers shedding whatever makes them different, in order to blend in with existing ideas and practices.
At the same time, each new group has hung onto its identity, including its language, as long as possible, until shamed and intimidated into shedding all or most evidence of its 'non-Americanness' (Dicker 52).
One of the ways that immigrant children become assimilated into American society is through the acquisition of the English language.
Various forms of language instruction programs have been designed for language minority students, including bilingual education programs, ESL, English-immersion, and dual-immersion programs.
The education of immigrant children is an important issue because first- and second-generation immigrant children are the most rapidly growing segment of the U.S. child population (Landale and Oropresa 1995, 1).
The country's public school system has not ever adequately served minority and poor children, and it is even less prepared to serve immigrant, linguistic minority children.
The increasing cultural and linguistic diversity and needs of these immigrant children are a unique challenge that more and more public school districts are facing.
The language education of immigrants is an issue that is closely linked with attitudes and policies on immigration.
It is also closely linked with public opinion on ongoing school reform legislation for the past few decades, including No Child Left Behind.
The tension between the different levels of government over language education policy is an indicator of the fundamental tension that exists in the US federal system.
Unfortunately, while the various levels of government duke it out over education policy, language minority students remain without the means to meaningful education.
The right to regulate immigration is one of the exclusive powers of the federal government; it is one of the delegated powers in the US Constitution.
Reflective Teaching Assignment #1
Part 1a: Lesson Plan Analysis
Criterion 1: Classroom Management
How will students get materials?
The lesson plan lists the needed materials but does not explain how materials will be distributed.
Because the classroom space is limited and the number of students is quite large, the teacher will distribute the materials to groups as students work on predicting.
Many adult helpers will be present during the time of instruction, so they can help distribute materials to pairs and groups of threes.
How will the teacher call the class back together while students are working in pairs?
The lesson plan omits how the teacher should transition between whole-class and small group learning.
This is a transition that occurs frequently in science classrooms!
To best facilitate this transition, I would use musical instruments to get the students attention.
These instruments (bells, horns, squeaky toys, songs, etc.) are easily heard above student chatter and do not require the teacher to yell.
(My students already know that these instruments are used to get their attention and respond almost immediately.)
How will students be monitored?
The lesson plan does not mention how students will be monitored in their groups.
It is important for the teacher to walk around the classroom and observe groups as they work.
Proximity is a wonderful tool for keeping students on task!
Also, the other adult helpers in the room will monitor students and their work, helping to keep the students on task and the pepper off the floor.
Criterion 2:
Establishing a Sense of Purpose
Students must understand why they are performing the demonstrations included in the lesson.
This will make the work more relevant to their lives, interesting, and engaging.
Does the lesson help teachers make the purpose of the activity explicit to students?
The lesson does a nice job of explaining to the students that they are conducting demonstrations to learn about what causes a lightning strike.
I would further explain that the students are learning about static electricity in preparation for a follow-up lesson about electricity in the weather.
The students should be looking forward to the next lesson!
Is the purpose meaningful to students and anchored in the lives of learners?
The subject of static electricity is meaningful to students because students encounter this phenomena on a daily basis in the forms of shocks from the McDonald's Playland slides, the wrappers of their juice box straws sticking to their hands, and many others.
The purpose given in the lesson plan (learning information to later explain the occurrence of electricity in weather) directly relates to their personal experiences with thunderstorms.
The subject of lightning is anchored in students' lives and is interesting to students because it is a powerful force in nature.
Learning about what causes the large and dangerous flashes of lightning they see during thunderstorms will be cool and engaging.
Does the lesson help the teacher connect the purpose of the activity to what students have been learning about thus far in class?
The lesson plan says to review with students what they know about cloud formation, thunder, and lightning storms.
This connects the purpose of the activities to a unit on weather.
However, my students are learning about magnetism, not weather, and are transitioning into learning about electricity.
I would connect the activities to the force of attraction between two objects students have observed when playing with magnets, especially the knowledge that like charges repel and opposite charges attract.
This would connect the lesson to what students have been studying in their electricity and magnetism unit.

"Think Globally, Act Locally"
Introduction
Students of environmental conservation are well aware of the canon, Think Globally, Act Locally, but to what extent is the global aspect actually realized?
People should be more inclined to act locally more than globally, but what causes an individual to think globally?
In other words, how far (literally) do our own environmental values span?
Using and adding to research on the psychology of choice, and the effects of framing and protected values, this experiment tests the scope of people's environmental concerns.
Here, I test how international versus national environmental issues effect people's choices.
Tversky and Kahneman (1981: 453) argue that rational decision-makers will prefer prospects that offer the highest expected utility.
However, this rationality may be thwarted when prospects are framed differentially, in terms of gains and losses.
When prospects are framed in terms of gains, the chosen option is more likely to be risk averse.
In contrast, when prospects are framed in terms of losses, the chosen option is more likely to be risk-taking.
Tversky and Kahneman (1981) argue that people do not simply become irrational, but rather they make bounded decisions based on the most readily available, although limited, information.
Protected values may confound these framing effects.
Protected values are firmly held ethical beliefs about one's duties and rights as a human being.
Such values shape individual behavior because people are concerned not only with the consequences of the action, but also with the very nature of their own participation (Baron&amp;
Spranca, 1997).
People with protected values cannot trade their personal values for others, and if they do, they are unhappy with their decision.
Baron and Spranca (1997) suggest that protected values prohibit certain actions.
Tanner and Medin (2004), in contrast, argue that protected values influence people to act, out of moral obligation; active moral obligation is stronger than moral prohibition of actions.
Tanner and Medin qualify their argument by suggesting that, at least in terms of environmental values and behavior, prohibitions against action may be salient when the act can be seen as causing harm.
In contrast, obligation to act may be more salient when the act can be seen as promoting something good (in press: 4).
Thus, there may be a relationship between the framing of the action prospects/options, such that harm (negativity) induces omission, while good actions (positivity) induces action.
This argument holds, however, only when protected values are present and strong.
Tanner and Medin suggest that when protected values are lacking, or even weakly present, tendencies are, as Tversky and Kahneman (1981) argue, malleable such that the way a prospect is framed may sway one's answer.
Experimental Question and Predictions
This experiment, then, will test an individual's reaction to different types of framed national and international environmental conservation situations.
Several predictions are made, based on the above research.
1) If protected values do not exist, participant choices will be influenced by the way in which the scenario prospects are framed:
a) When prospects are framed in terms of gains (positive), the chosen option is more likely to be risk averse.
(framing affect present)
b) When prospects are framed in terms of losses (negative), the chosen option is more likely to be risk-taking.
(framing affect present)
c) National scenarios will evoke a stronger framing effect than will international scenarios.
d) The intensity of the framing effect will highest for charismatic endangered species scenarios, lower for non-charismatic endangered species scenarios, and lowest for forest remnant scenarios.
2) If protected values do exist, participant choices will be less influenced by the way in which the scenario prospects are framed:
a) The presence of national protected values will result in a lower or absent framing effect for national scenarios, but not for international scenarios.
b) The presence of international protected values will result in a lower or absent framing effect for international values, but not for national scenarios.

Washington Changes the Green Card Rules
There is going to be new US immigration plan to modify Green Card rules, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
It envisages reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and are supported by the president.
The draft law is due to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do this by changing the way the US issues Green Cards to citizens from other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current scheme.

Oral Bioavailability Evaluation of Soil-Borne Chemicals Using In Vitro Bioavailability Tests
Abstract
Current environmental laws impose site remediation goals based upon the risk to human or ecological health.
Site remediation goals utilize several risk exposure pathways.
This review focuses on the soil ingestion exposure pathway, which often drives the remediation goals for many recalcitrant contaminants.
While background toxicity tests often administer highly soluble salts to test organisms, a significant fraction of soil-borne chemicals are often not bioavailable, or absorbed in the human gastrointestinal (GI) system.
The requisite extraction procedures for chemicals in soils (e.g.
EPA Method 3050B) are significantly more aggressive than the GI system and are likely to overestimate the bioavailable concentrations.
Bioavailability assays have been developed to estimate the bioavailable concentration of organic chemicals, inorganic chemicals, or radionuclides in soil.
Bioavailability work has yielded numerous advances including novel remediation techniques and an enhanced understanding of the soil ingestion risk exposure pathway.
This review summarizes the most common bioavailable tests, approaches to validate these tests, past research using these tests, challenges facing these tests, and potential future applications.
Introduction
This study focuses on soil-borne nonvolatile, immobile, and/or hydrophobic contaminants.
For chemicals in soil to pose a potential human or ecological health risk, chemicals must be present in a specific medium, and a mechanism, or exposure pathway, must exist for chemical migration from the medium to a receptor organism.
These exposure pathways are illustrated in Figure 1.
One exposure pathway is inhalation of dust that may contain an organic or inorganic chemical.
Organic chemicals volatilized from the soil also have the potential to be inhaled independently of dust.
Soil ingestion is another exposure pathway.
Inadvertently, all people ingest some small amount of dirt or dust.
Children ingest roughly 50-200 mg soil/day (2,3).
Soil ingestion is particularly problematic for children with pica syndrome for soil, a mental condition characterized by habitual soil consumption (4).
When a person's skin is caked with mud or dirt, there is a potential for chemicals to detach from the soil matrix and be absorbed through the skin.
This process is named the dermal absorption exposure pathway.
Lastly, uptake of contaminated groundwater is problematic in sites where water-soluble contaminants leech into drinking water supplies.
Soil ingestion is the risk exposure pathway that frequently drives site risk assessment with nonvolatile, immobile, and/or hydrophobic contaminants chemicals.
Harmful chemical influences on the human body are typically divided into carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic effects.
Potential carcinogenic effects are typically expressed in terms of a hypothetical cancer risk.
This value is determined for a chemical concentration that may cause one additional person to develop cancer out of one hundred thousand or one million people (1 x 10-5 or 1 x 10-6) over a person's lifetime (70 years is the typically assumed length).
On the other hand, noncarcinogenic chemicals cause a deleterious effect on a system or organ, and the receptor at greatest risk is typically young children.
There is a formidable level of difficulty and controversy in determining whether a compound is unacceptably dangerous at a certain concentration.
Typically, epidemiological data are analyzed or studies are performed on rodents or other organisms whose digestive system most closely resemble the human gastrointestinal (GI) system. To keep the experimental populations small, incredibly high doses are given to the organisms to increase the effect size.
In this testing, animals are typically fed the contaminant through a highly soluble form such as HgCl2 (5).
In the bioavailability literature, the terms bioavailability and bioacessibility are used to describe similar, although different, concepts.
Bioaccessibility is defined as the contaminant concentration that becomes available for absorption into the central blood or lymph system.
On the other hand, bioavailability is defined as the chemical concentration that actually becomes absorbed into the central blood or lymph system.

The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be concerned
Just when you thought 2017 couldn't get any weirder along comes a new report on the technological developments in the sex robot sector.
Yep.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) released a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye colour, nipple shape and fingernail type.
"People snigger about them, but the companies are actually shipping quite a lot and we are going to see them a lot more," Mr Sharkey said at the launch of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved out of their blow-up counterparts into robots with a silicon skin that is warm to the touch - with deliberately human-like responses achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customise" their robot to suit their persuasions, choosing everything from the robot's eye colour, nipple shape to fingernail type or colour.
But it gets even more disturbing, with many of the robots possessing "personalities" that would make a Stepford Wife look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicon skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows users to customise their robots according to the traits they find appealing, such as shyness.
Then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, which come with pre-programmed personalities, including "Frigid Farrah" that gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality which is matched as much as possible to your personality," the True Companion website enthuses.
So she likes what you like, dislikes what you dislike, etc.
She also has moods during the day just like real people!
She can be sleepy, conversational or she can 'be in the mood'!"
There are many disturbing aspects to the rise of sex robots - not least of which is the replacement of real, human relationships - but the subservient female traits, the rapey connotations of making a move on Frigid (read: resistant) Farrah, are the most concerning.
On its website, True Companion likened Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If woman (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" the website states.
However, these sex robots are not a mere fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication points to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality toward a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional add-on.
Most men, naturally, are not going to keep sex robots, and while the FRR noted their increasing popularity, they remain, for now, on the outskirts of consumer culture.
But what seeps in from the fringes can be highly instructive as to the tenor of the era we're living in.
And many people aren't weird or offensive until the free market gives them the permission to be so.
There is little coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots have emerged at a time when women's rights are under threat across the globe, when there is a president in the White House who has bragged about sexually assaulting women.
The most chilling aspect of the TV series The Handmaid's Tale isn't the graphic imagery, the noosed bodies and gouged eyes, but just how realistic that vision feels.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but, right now, it doesn't feel like a large one.
The aim behind these sex robots is to create as much of a physical likeness to actual women (albeit with porn star proportions) as technologically possible.
Their creators want them to feel human to the touch, for them to mimic the movement of a real body.
But, pointedly, when it comes to their "personalities" the robots do not represent real women.
They cannot break up with their companion, or walk out.
They have no agency or back-story, nothing to suggest independence or anything that may disrupt the fantasy of total servitude.
They are pleasant slaves, in other words.
Or to put it into 2017 parlance: handmaidens.
An NBA star on the green.
Curry is fighting to make the cut in California.
Despite messing up his first shot, star basketball player Stephen Curry made it through the first round between professional golfers.
The two-time holder of the record for the most-valuable NBA player took part in the Egoie Mae Classic, a lower series run by Web.com Tour in Hayward, California. He ended his first round with 74 shots and will keep fighting to make the cut.
Golden State point guard, who won his second NBA title with the Warriors this season, started very nervously, and his first shot ended up in the drink holder of a golf cart parked at the fairway.
Even after that, he was not as accurate as on the basketball court, but he had a dozen professionals behind him on the scoreboard with four-over-par.
"It wasn't the ideal way to get started, to have to call the referee right after the first shot, but then it settled down a bit," said Curry about his enormous stage fright.
I very nervous when I took the first shot of the tournament, but it was everything I hoped for.
"If you'd told me I was going to shoot 74 going into the round, I'd take that all day, every day," he added.
If Curry is able to make the cut, which is likely to be around two under par, he will become the first representative of another sport to prove themselves on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now that I've got rid of the nerves, it might work," said the enthusiastic golfer, who had played in celebrity tournaments in the past, as well as mixed amateur and professional competitions.
The event in Hayward is his first time starting in a tournament that falls under the PGA.

Trump's great feat?
Making Mitt Romney seem the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarised the US electorate have, on a micro-scale, torn families apart.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the US abounded with advice columns on how to deal with the horror of Trump-voting relatives.
We are all supposedly straining to burst our filter bubbles.
Less remarked on is the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and who's long been at loggerheads with Republicans in our family, has been visiting me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican sibling she had been bickering with about politics for decades, is suddenly and peculiarly on the same side.
Around the dinner table this is surely a good thing; but it strikes me that, in a broader context, it carries significant risks.
The left has been invigorated by Trump, but the warping effect of his presidency has the power to push us all rightwards.
When we talk about "normalisation" and Trump, we are referring to the scary possibility that his antics may one day cease to appal.
There is an even scarier long-range scenario, however, in which what Trump "normalises" are rightwing Republicans who, held up against his standards, suddenly seem the epitome of reasonable.
I find myself actively nostalgic these days for Mitt Romney's quaint version of crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, seem very mild offences indeed.
When Trump goes, the next Republican candidate will merely have to be sane to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
While my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the carousels run by the New York parks department, and the best three bucks you can spend in the city if you don't require caffeine.
The horses are thunderously huge, the fibre-glass designs on the central cylinder - all gurning clowns and animals twisting to look over their own shoulders in terror - utterly sinister, and the tinkling music oddly transporting.
So many of the cliches of a city disappoint: views from tall buildings get old, skylines grow too familiar to offer much of a thrill, and the reality of the city doesn't live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later and I'm still not entirely over the day I discovered Swiss Cottage is not, in fact, a Swiss cottage - the theme pub, Ye Olde Swiss Cottage, doesn't count - but a large roundabout in north London.
The Central Park carousel, however, is still a weirdly magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel I would have given it full marks, but thankfully nobody asked.
In a department store this week, on the other hand, I was required, before swiping my credit card, to rate my transactional "experience" on a scale of one to five stars.
In the coffee shop at the corner of my street it's the same thing, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip - this for buying something over the counter.
The effect of this is not only to slow down what should be a neutral exchange, but to put pressure on the server to inject personality into a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the department store stood grinning apologetically while, wearily, I gave the experience of handing her my credit card five stars.
Oscar Pistorius taken from jail to hospital with chest pains
This is the second time Pistorius has left jail for a hospital visit.
Last year he was taken to the hospital for treatment to cuts on his wrists, which prison authorities said he sustained after falling in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors against an initial manslaughter verdict.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her multiple times through a toilet cubicle door at his Pretoria home.
Pistorius claimed he mistook his girlfriend for a nighttime intruder hiding in the cubicle.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it will appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius faces having his sentence increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, a young panda that mated in the wild has given birth in captivity.
The panda rescue programme is a huge success.
The centre is trying to expand the gene pool of pandas in captivity.
Centre worker Chang Chi-Chung told New China that panda breeding is at risk of inbreeding.
There were only 471 pandas living in captivity at the end of last year.
Only two thousand survive in the wild.
The effort to mate captured pandas with wild ones is the first step to help protect this species.
Fifteen-year-old Cao Cao was released into a nature reserve at the beginning of the panda mating season on 11 March.
Researchers could see every step she took thanks to the tracking device on her neck.
Cao Cao met her chosen mate 12 days later.
The sexual intercourse with the local male lasted for a minute and a half, and was successful.
This can also be considered a small miracle, because panda males are not generally considered to be the most successful lovers in the animal kingdom.
Males are bad at estimating the time when the female is ready, they are often confused and do not know what to do.
The baby was born healthy and, given that Cao-Cao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, weighed 216 grams after delivery.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams less.
A Brief Critique of the DSM-IV
The DSM-IV is a document that has far-reaching consequences.
The assignment of a DSM-IV diagnosis affects how an individual is treated medically, therapeutically, professionally and socially.
It is precisely because of its direct and indirect ramifications that the construction of the DSM-IV has been the topic of ongoing concern and debate among theorists, researchers and clinicians.
Although a number of these discussions have lead to productive changes in the structure of the DSM-IV, it is of course inevitable that some problems remain to be addressed.
Four such issues will be addressed herein and will be accompanied by corrective suggestions.
I.
The assignment of agency
It is self-evident that the final decision regarding the appropriateness of a DSM-IV diagnosis is made by a professional; although the input from the individual will certainly influence the practitioner's decision, they ultimately have little say in whether or not they receive a diagnosis and which diagnosis they are given.
The implication of this is two-fold, depending on which disorder is in question.
In instances such as schizophrenia, the individual's self-report of subjective experience is irrelevant in making a diagnosis, because that individual is considered incompetent (Widiger&amp; Coker, 2003).
In other instances, such as dysthymia, some input from the individual (such as whether their symptoms interfere with daily life) is considered (American Psychiatric Association, 1994).
Nevertheless, the individual (who is the expert in reporting their own behaviors, thoughts and emotions) is at the mercy of the professional, who makes the ultimate decision as to whether the profile meets criteria for a disorder.
It could easily be the case that individuals who are experiencing severe difficulties may not be viewed as worthy of a diagnosis (when they would in fact benefit from the psychopharmacology or therapy available).
On the other hand, other individuals who are adamant that they are not experiencing difficulties may be diagnosed and treated against their will, which could be seen as a severe breach of human rights (Szasz, 1986).
The assignment of a diagnosis in these latter cases must be questioned - for whose benefit is the diagnosis?
There are important social policy implications here, and a consideration must be given to whether the diagnosis is given to benefit the individual or to ease the trouble of others in dealing with unusual and potentially problematic behaviors.
There is no clear resolution to this matter; it is not possible nor reasonable to place the diagnostic process into the hands of the lay-person, and yet the individual in question must be considered a reliable source of information regarding their own experience.
What is important to keep in mind is that providing a diagnosis does not change the actual phenomenon as experienced by the individual; it does change their access to medical, therapeutic and financial support but may also come with certain social and interpersonal costs.
The practitioner should make the individual an active partner in the process of diagnosis to determine whether the consequences of assigning a diagnosis would be accurate and beneficial.
In those cases where the individual is, in the eyes of the practitioner, incapable on realistic self-report, family and close friends should be involved in the process in order to keep the best interests of that particular individual in mind.
II.
Categorical vs. continuous OR what's pathological?
The issue of whether pathological behaviors are discrete from normal behavior or are more extreme (but continuous) forms of typical traits has been the topic of continued debate.
It seems undeniable that the characteristics which define a number of (if not all) disorders (i.e., depression, anxiety, involuntary thoughts) are likely present at some point or another, to varying degrees, in all of us.
Proficiency, Differentiation, and Universal Education
Success For All (SFA), one of the leading comprehensive school reform programs, proclaims in its title the driving philosophy behind its intervention.
Every child can and must achieve the same minimum level of success, first in reading proficiency and eventually, by way of improved literacy, across the entire range of academic subjects.
A similar ideal is now embedded within the greater structure of the educational system, by way of the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) legislation which mandates nation-wide proficiency in English-Language Arts and Mathematics by 2014.
Again, the theory is that a successful school is one in which all students perform at or above the same universal standard.
Neither the school-based SFA nor the federal NCLB presuppose that every student will follow an identical route to high achievement, but they agree that the correct response to individual student needs is the adaptation of school services, not standards.
The tenets of this proficiency model of education are laid out especially clearly in SFA's promotional material:
The school must relentlessly stick with every child until that child is succeeding, write Robert Slavin and Nancy A.
Madden.
If prevention is not enough, the child may need tutoring.
If this is not enough, he or she may need help with behavior or attendance or eyeglasses.
If this is not enough, he or she may need a modified approach to reading or other subjects.
The school does not merely provide services to children, it constantly assesses the results of the services it provides and keeps varying or adding services until every child is successful (Slavin and Madden 2001, p. 5).
According to this proficiency-based philosophy, educational outcomes are what matter, and a school that varies its definition of success for individual students is not doing its job.
This vision of education stands in marked contrast to the model pushed by a series of educational reformers through much of the first half of the twentieth century.
Indeed, today's consensus around the proficiency model must be seen at least in part as the result of a widespread critique of the alternative differentiation model that rose to dominance during the Progressive Era and became increasingly embedded in the bureaucracy of educational governance.
Encompassing the expansion of expansion of IQ testing, tracking, and the rise of vocational education, this system of differentiation and scientific management advocated flexibility in educational goals to take into account natural student limitations.
The result, advocates of the proficiency model contend, has been the legitimation of vast achievement gaps, tending to fall along lines of race and class.
These criticisms bear an element of truth, and the turn toward the proficiency model is meaningful because it reframes the goals of schooling around a series of universal measures.
Yet the strength of the proficiency model as a counter-discourse makes it easy to lose sight of the fact that it does not in and of itself solve the problem of student difference.
Rather, it provides an important way of thinking about educational equality but does little to ensure that high quality education will follow.
If disadvantaged students today are to be given a meaningfully higher quality of education than in the past, it will not be sufficient to rely upon vague goals of universal proficiency.
Instead, high standards will need to be linked directly to mechanisms that build school capacity, raising teaching quality in order to ensure meaningful gains for all students.

The Netherlands alone has temporarily closed 180 poultry farms because of the incident.
According to Reuters, NVWA, the Netherlands's Food Safety Authority, has examined 20 percent of all Dutch poultry, which they claim means that 80 percent of the eggs on the market are acceptable.

Complexity Theory:
Simplifying Life for Organizational Theorists
The fact that so many metaphors are used in interpreting organizations is evidence enough that analyzing an organization is not child's play.
A majority of the paradigms used so far have each been successful in explaining particular aspects of the behavior of organizations.
Few have the inherent ability to decipher the complicated behavior observed over varied lengths of time.
Especially when time is an important factor in the current world, there is a need for new paradigms and metaphors that (ideally) single-handedly help unravel the underlying principles and thereby provide tools for not only explaining, but also predicting the courses that organizations take over their life cycles.
So what is a paradigm, and what is a metaphor?
According to Kuhn, a paradigm can be looked at broadly in three senses of the term: (1) as a complete view of reality, or way of seeing; (2) as relating to the social organization of science in terms of schools of thought connected with particular kinds of scientific achievements; and (3) as relating to the concrete use of specific kinds of tools and texts for the process of scientific puzzle solving.
Organization theorists often approach their subject from a frame of reference based upon certain assumptions that are taken-for-granted [1].
Depending on the metaphors developed through these schools of thought, they interpret various activities of an organization.
These metaphors are then interpreted by others, including hands-on managers, in the hope of predicting something about the future, which Morgan calls the puzzle solving level.
Figure 1 gives a graphical description of the scenario envisioned by Morgan.
In his book Images of Organization, Morgan interprets numerous attributes of organizations, and their behavior, through different metaphors.
While all these explanations are of high quality in the conditional interpretations, they are not of great use when they stand independently.
And worse, the organization is not a linear combination of the functions described by these metaphors.
The search is on for a paradigm that accepts the convoluted nature of entities and proceeds from there.
Enter Chaos theory, a relatively young branch of science that does exactly the same and goes about simplifying the problems at hand while accepting that a perfect solution might not be available.
Chaos and Complexity Theories
Chaos theory was initially developed to explain some of the complicated interactions between entities in Physics and was extended successfully to explain a different interpretation of evolution before it came into the notice of social scientists.
It focuses on intensely non-linear systems which can be termed to be mathematically deterministic, but cannot be solved.
The systems are stable, but are not repetitive: small changes in the independent variables may bring about variedly different changes in the output variables.
Complexity Theory (CT), whose roots lie in Chaos theory, assumes a more pacifying approach in that it takes systems to be more stable and predictable compared to Chaotic systems.
It states that order emerges naturally because of unpredictable interaction-interaction is the vehicle by which this occurs and unpredictability is the stimulus that promotes novelty [2]. CT is further extended to suit social science's requirements; combining Systems Theory with CT lead to the development of Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS), which assume that coherence under change is the central enigma [*].
The principal conditions for the full applicability of CT include: (1) non-linearity, (2) iteration and (3) sensitivity to initial conditions [3].
This is fulfilled clearly by organizations in general.
Furthermore, concepts of CT like (Lorenz) attractors, bifurcation points, etc. (refer to appendix A) can be handy in explaining phenomena like innovation and technological cycles as well as the stability observed in organizations.
Organizations make important decisions regarding the direction they choose to go in at the Edge of Chaos, an important phase in the organization's history.
It is interesting to note that there are relatively few states that organizations settle down in as compared to the possible states they could have landed themselves in had they taken random decisions.
As opposed to blind natural selection suggested by Darwin's Theory of Evolution, Stuart Kauffman's observation was extended to social systems by Russ Marion to state that the number of groups that emerge in a social system is a square root, exponential function of the number of people in that system [2].
This phenomenon, which he called Autocatalysis, can also be applied on a micro-scale in modeling change programs in organizations, especially those which are developed bottoms-up.

Riga is amazing, I'm going to miss, said goalkeeper Sedláček as he looks for a new engagement.
I would like to play for another 10 years.
"Maybe I'll go back one day," smiled the 27-year-old Sedlacek, who could start the season in a jersey for Zlin.
It depends on whether he finds an engagement before the start of the new year.
How were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I had to rate it like in school, then three.
I didn't play much the first year, I had an experienced goalie above me.
I was learning.
In the second year I started playing.
Before the third season I thought they would give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalkeeper, and we alternated in the role.
Last year, I assumed I would play all the time.
But we only got five points in the first ten games, so the coaches began to change things around.
My teammate ended up playing more often.
That's just how it is.
They wanted to warm him up for next season.
How was life in Riga?
Amazing.
It's a small Prague.
A beautiful, European, historic city.
I'll miss it.
I found a girlfriend there.
We've been together three years, and we'll get married next year.
So I brought something back with me.
How challenging is the KHL for goalkeepers?
The top ten teams are really high quality.
Then there are teams like us or Slovan, which have to change their playing style against them.
The other side have the skills, so you have to compensate for it with something.
That means playing more towards the rear, fighting more.
I did not see any problems in the width of the pitch.
The difference is that the Russians want to play in the empty space.
They shoot less, and even if they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to keep playing.
They shoot more in the Czech Republic.

How do Latvians perceive their club in the KHL?
Like a national team.

Even when things were going badly, a lot of people would come.
Did Dinamo's activities in the KHL help Latvia to move to the quarterfinals at this year's World Cup?
The KHL has been going since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
Their results at the World Championships started to improve from that time.
They only just lost 1:2 in the quarterfinals against Canada at the Sochi Olympics in 2014.
It was an unbelievable result for them.
They've reached a higher level thanks to the KHL.
More and more Latvian players are setting their sights on the Czech Extraliga.
Roberts Bukarts made it to Zlín and Ralfs Freibergs is about to sign a contract.
Why is it that so many of them go there?
They're not second rate players, they're high quality.
Our local teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians included.
It's a natural progression.
The KHL starts in three weeks.
Why is it that you still don't have a position?
I knew that I wouldn't stay in Riga since the beginning of February.
So, I started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But since they didn't have a budget for a goalkeeper we didn't come to an agreement.
It was classic.
We spoke to various teams that ultimately went on to sign someone else.
So now I'm training back home in Zlín and I'll wait for something to come up.
Aren't you nervous about that?
I was four years ago, when I went away and didn't know how it would be.
The current situation isn't exactly ideal, but on the other hand it means I can spend some time at home.
I did some playing in the KHL, so I see it differently now.
The question is when and where I'll sign.
How likely is it that you'll start the new year in Zlín?
Anything could happen.
We'll see how things stand in a month.
Now all I can do is wait to see what my agent arranges.
Do you have a preference for a particular competition?
Given how last season went, I'm not really in a position to choose.
So I'm waiting for the phone to ring.
Dear Henry,
I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it.
I am sorry you did not like my last letter.
Why did you enclose the stamps?
I am awfully angry with you.
I do wish I could punish you for that.
I called you naughty boy because I do not like that other world.
Please tell me what is the real meaning of that word?
Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy?
I do wish I could do something for you.
Please tell me what you think of poor me.
I often think of the beautiful name you have.
Dear Henry, when will we meet?
I think of you so often you have no idea.
I have never felt myself so much drawn to a man as you.
I feel so bad about.
Please write me a long letter and tell me more.
Remember if you do not I will punish you.
So now you know what I will do to you, you naughty boy, if you do not wrote.
O how I long to meet you.
Henry dear, do not deny my request before my patience are exhausted.
Then I will tell you all.
Goodbye now, naughty darling, I have such a bad headache. today. and write by return to your longing
Martha
P.S. Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use.
I want to know.
The reader, after trudging through the strange stream-of-consciousness and reference-heavy prose introducing her to Stephen and Bloom, finally encounters Martha's straightforward letter in Lotus-Eaters.
The letter, at first, comes as a welcome change—as the reader easily digests the simple prose, free of difficult allusion.
Martha's letter, still early in the narrative, proves a lotus-like escape for the reader, just as s/he assumes that this affair must provide some kind of escape for Bloom from his faulty marriage to Molly.
Only after reading on in the novel does the reader learn the duplicitous nature of this letter's straightforward prose—that whenever Joyce offers her something easy to digest, it surely can't be so.
Just as Father Conmee's simple and repetitive prose betrays his self-obsessed and delusional nature and Gerty MacDowell's cliché-ridden section demonstrates the influence and control advertising and popular culture hold over her identity, the reader should not approach Martha's letter as a narcotic escape from the difficulty of the text.
Similarly, while Bloom and Martha's epistolary affair might at first seem an exciting escape from his faulty marriage, both Bloom's immediate treatment of the letter and the reoccurrences of Martha's words throughout the text imply that the affair works no better as an escape for Bloom than for the reader—it actually confronts him with his actions in light of the his struggling marriage to Molly.
On first reading, the letter's unadorned prose proves refreshing, but many of Martha's syntactical and grammatical errors betray her awkward bravado.
Martha's trip-up, I do not like that other world, (substituting world for word) for example, could, with a Freudian slip, refer to the real world—outside of the couple's fantasy relationship.
And even if Martha's slip up holds no significance for her own situation, it certainly holds plenty for Bloom's, whose other world crumbles throughout the day.
Additionally, the letter seems made up of sentiments alternately sad and longing, and tawdry and flirty—making the flirtation appear difficult and somewhat pitiful.
Martha's are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy? exhibits this perfectly.
The question are you not happy in your home? feels poignant and especially pertinent for the day, but Martha's calling Bloom a poor little naughty boy reminds the reader how much this letter operates as a performance.
Thus, the flirtation complicates the question—seemingly asking, is that why we're doing this?
The government trip to Lety continues.
In January of this year I wrote about the camp at Lety, near Orlík in the article "With the Care of a Decent Manager?"
The essence of the problem remains the same, and so I'll refer to the key passage of the article.
There has been talk about the camp in Lety for many years.
For the readers who do not know exactly what's going on, it's probably best if they look at the official cultural heritage site of Pietní místo Lety, for example.
There, at the beginning of the historical overview, it states that the camp lay two kilometres east of the village of Lety, that it served as a labour camp from 8 August 1940, as a displaced persons camp from 1 January 1942 and became a Roma camp on 2 August 1942.
The text below this goes on to describe life in the camp, including inhumane conditions, until March 1943, when Lety's first prisoners were assigned to the Auschwitz transport.
On 4 May 1943, 370 people were transported to the extermination camp.
The overall total was 420.
It is a very sad history of enormous suffering on the part of human beings caused to them by human beings and perverse ideology.
There is no question about the need to remember these events constantly.
There is also no question that the remembrance should take place at the memorial located in the place where these people suffered.
The problem lies elsewhere.
During socialism, the camp was slightly forgotten about, and in the 1970s a pig farm was built near and on the part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by American Paul Polansky, and a memorial was erected at Lety in 1995.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy and demolish the pig farm, but so far it has not happened.
In 1998, the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration has been governed by the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the pig farm.
These are facts about the camp's post-war fate in brief.
At least, that was until autumn of this year, when the government approved the purchase of the pig farm and decided to call an expert judgment to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government is rumoured to buying the pig farm back after.
According to Minister of Culture Herman, "there are some figures, but I would probably upset the plans if I went to the public with them."
We'll see what the expert opinion leads to.
According to some unofficial estimates, it may amount to hundreds of millions, while according to others the price may reach up to a billion.
In any case, it will definitely not be a cheap matter.
And just a few hundred metres from the former camp is a memorial in which the state invested almost 10 million crowns in 2010.
Even if the whole transaction were funded by the UN Human Rights Committee, which obviously is not likely, in my opinion it would still be a waste of money.
Doesn't the government have other priorities?
The memorial, a solemn place of commemoration, stands there thanks to the will of history, almost in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy, and anyone who wants to can go there to pay tribute to the memory of those who suffered and were killed.
I don't see any reason to change it!
Let's just leave it as it is, and maintain the site of reverence with the utmost care.
The property, and now also the taxpayers' money, should be entrusted to a responsible person, in this case the government of the Czech Republic, to oversee it with the care of a dutiful manager.
They should at least treat it as if it were their own company.
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Deputy Prime Minister do not represent the whole government.
However, given the aforementioned facts, I feel that the leader of the ANO movement is only using it as an empty pre-election proclamation.
This May I went directly to the place to see it.
It has a good driveway, orderly parking and replicas of the wooden camp huts.
There is an exhibition in one, and an integrated toilet with running water in another.
There is a small, outdoor amphitheater with a seating area and a view of the memorial site, made from stones placed on a slight slope.
There are a lot of flowers and wreaths.
All the attributes correspond to the meaning of this place, and are suitable and appropriate.
Archaeological research is currently taking place on the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether it would be possible to preserve some of the uncovered foundations, for example, and at least make them accessible in an appropriate visual manner.
Minister of Culture Daniel Herman could be focussing his efforts in this direction.
If he succeeds in pushing the government to buy a pig farm with state money, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already problematic time in the role of Minister of Culture.
The Broken Cord is a story about Michael Dorris and his Native American adopted son Adam who is suffering from fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS).
FAS is a set of physical and mental birth defects that can result when a woman drinks alcohol during her pregnancy.
Children with FAS are helpless victims who are abused by their parents even before they are born, and doomed to live with this condition all their lives.
In this respect this book was depressing to read.
I also shared anger with the author in that there seemed to be no reason for Adam (and all the other children with FAS) to be punished by having to live their lives with such illness.
Nevertheless, the book was very interesting from a systems perspective.
Adam was simultaneously involved in multiple systems including family, school, and culture, and his suffering from FAS amplified both the positive and the negative interactions between the systems.
This book also forced me to think, So, what can be done to help children like Adam?
There is no simple answer to this question, and different systems all have their roles to play to prevent FAS and to help children with this condition to live better lives.
Moreover, as a student in clinical psychology, I could not avoid thinking about what clinical psychologists can and should do in the process of prevention and intervention.
Here, I will first describe the issues raised in The Broken Cord from a multiple systems perspective, and then discuss the implications of this systems analysis for intervention and the role of clinical psychology.
Understanding The Broken Cord from a Multiple Systems Perspective
I divided this part into two, family systems and broader system contexts because it seemed almost impossible to discuss all the systems together at once.
I want to emphasize, however, that this does not mean that family is in any way separated from other broader systems such as school or culture.
All systems are linked with one another and the mutual influence should be considered when systems are discussed separately.
Family Systems
I think the most important issue in a family with a child suffering from chronic illness would be the problem of balancing togetherness and autonomy.
Adam does not have motivation or ability to perform most of the tasks that are expected of children of his age.
He cannot manage some of the most basic daily tasks (e.g., washing and feeding himself) by himself.
This makes it inevitable for other family members (and also other people involved in taking care of him) to intrude into his life to the extent that would be unlikely to happen to other children without FAS.
However, Adam must develop autonomy so he can at least take care of himself in situations where help from others is absent or minimum (e.g., at his jobs, etc).
Adam seems to have gained some autonomy by feeding himself without help from family members (when he lives by himself for awhile for his job), but there still remains an important question of deciding what level of autonomy he can and should reach.
Since Adam is suffering from FAS which will affect his life in every domain in significant ways, it will be unlikely that he will be able to achieve or will be expected by others to achieve autonomy as much as other children.
So, where should the line be drawn?
Another related issue if what the appropriate subsystem boundaries are in the family.
It is ideal to have different subsystems, the spouse subsystem, the parental subsystem, and the sibling subsystem, to maintain clear boundaries for the family to function well (Goldberg&amp;
Goldberg, 2004).
The typical problem in the single-parent family with one child (this is the situation before Michael adopted two more children and married Louise) is that the two family members are enmeshed and overdependent on each other (Goldberg&amp;
Goldberg, 2004), but this does not apply to Michael's family.

Platonic Thought in Book I of Livy's Ab Urbe Condita
Plato represents perhaps the watershed moment in intellectual history.
His obvious philosophical influence is best expressed by Whitehead's assertion, that all of Western philosophy is but a footnote to Plato.
In recent years, there has been an increased interest in Plato's literary impact as well.
Certainly, in terms of both thought and style, the major Alexandrian poets are significantly indebted to Plato.
In the Aeneid, the difference that we observe between Virgil's underworld and that of Homer in the Odyssey is due in large part to conceptions of the afterlife developed by Plato.
However, one area where Platonic influence seems to not be perceived quite as keenly is historiography.
Naturally, many arguments and ideas in Plato have become the domain of political philosophy, but few ever seem to consider how historians, and particularly ancient ones, incorporated Platonic thought into their works.
This is especially odd given the fact that so many ancient historians assume a negative outlook, viewing history as something essentially degenerative; this fits so neatly with Republic VIII, where Plato discusses the phases of a state's decline, from aristocracy to tyranny.
One author who seems to observe this model particularly well is Livy, in the first book of his Ab urbe condita.
The narrative pattern of the actual history of Rome in this book goes from its founding by Romulus to the expulsion of the tyrant Tarquinius Superbus.
Thus we have at the most basic level the frame of a degenerative process, from an ideal beginning to a bad end.
While this is simply a function of historical fact--the period of kings was essentially one of decline--the purpose of this paper is to show that in the first book of Livy's Ab urbe condita, Livy was consciously fitting his narrative to the phases described in Republic VIII.
The distinguishing feature of each character in the succession of kings is specifically matched to a type of government described in the Republic.
Livy casts Numa Pompilius as a philosopher king, Tullus Hostilius and Ancus Marcius as violent timocrats, Tarquinius Priscus as an oligarch, Servius Tullius as the democratic man, and Tarquinius Superbus as a tyrant.
These roles were not necessarily contained in the historical record, but were rather narrative decisions by Livy to promote the view of history contained in the Ab urbe condita.
In this respect, we shall see how this Platonic reading of the succession of kings in Book I supports the general view of history contained in the Ab urbe condita, as first described by T.J. Luce, and later by Gary Miles.
There is no need to consider the Republic in detail, but it will be useful to briefly outline the parts that pertain to this discussion.
Plato's ideal city is set up to function as a true aristocracy: it is to be ruled by those who are genuinely the best.
What makes them the best is their wisdom, which results from the mastery that the rational part of their soul exerts over the spirited and appetitive parts.
The dominance of these latter two parts in others gives rise to the other two classes of citizen, who are to be governed by the wise.
This, in the scheme of the Republic, is the most perfect way of organizing a state.
Other methods represent perverted forms of government;
Plato focuses on four of these in Book VIII, where he describes how a state can function poorly.
The first stage of deterioration from an aristocracy is a timocracy, where honor is prized even above virtue and wisdom, causing such a state to be unduly preoccupied with war and conquest.

The Bellum Hispaniense as a Face of Battle Narrative
Battle, for (the soldier), takes place in a wildly unstable physical and mental environment.
After describing a successful attack against the Pompeian forces, the anonymous author of the Spanish War sums up the significance of the day’s work:
And so the death of the two centurions the day before was avenged by this punishment of the enemy.
Far from analyzing the strategic effect of this victory on the course of the civil war, the author’s mind was fixed instead on the immediate result: retribution for the death of two of his comrades.
The anonymous Bellum Hispaniense from the Caesarian corpus is the closest thing we have to the soldier’s eye view from a military campaign in Antiquity.
The author was a junior officer, perhaps a cavalry commander (praefectus equitum), who gives us his account of the last action of Caesar’s civil war, not from the ‘eye of command’, but from the perspective of a more common participant.
The narrative, therefore, is not an over-arching analysis of Caesar’s entire campaign, but rather an account based on the author’s own experience of the war.
Yet, despite the influence of John Keegan’s The Face of Battle in Roman military studies and the diffusion of socio-cultural approaches to the Roman army, the author is still criticized for failing to provide a broad strategic analysis of Caesar’s campaign:
As a military commentator he lacks a sense of proportion, focusing instead on minor engagements, war atrocities, and desertions.
In other words: trivialities displace the solid information the reader would like on strategy, or even on tactics.
It is proposed here instead to consider the author as war-participant, not a war commentator, and to explore his trivialities for insights into a low-level Roman officer’s experience of war and the workings of the late Republican army.
First, however, we will take a brief look at the current state of ancient military historiography in order to better contextualize this approach to the Bellum Hispaniense.
Keegan, Kagan, and Ancient Military Historiography
Though Keegan’s earliest case study is the 15th-century battle of Agincourt, The Face of Battle has significantly altered the way ancient historians study warfare.
Keegan shifted the focus of military history away from the decisions of the commander to the actions of the common soldier.
There is an inherent disjunction, he argues, in the goals and outlook of these two on the battlefield: the soldier’s primary focus will centre on the issue of personal survival, to which the commander’s 'win/lose' system of values may be, indeed often proves, irrelevant or directly hostile.
It is this issue of personal survival in small-group dynamics that Keegan sees as the crucial factor governing the course of battle.
An account from the soldier’s prospective, therefore, as opposed to the command-centered narrative, is in a much better position to truly understand any particular battle and the nature of warfare in general.
Kimberly Kagan’s recent The Eye of Command is a direct response to the now-popular face of battle approach.
She argues that Keegan does not successfully link the participants’ individual experiences to a battle’s course and outcome: it instead employs explanations based on the general character of combat, what she terms generic causality, and it uses these to build a cumulative model of the battle, on the assumption that battle is the sum of the experiences of the individuals on the battlefield.
Ultimately this model does not explain what happened on the battlefield in terms of causal events.
To investigate the key causal events of battle, Kagan promotes the eye of command approach, best exemplified in the ancient world by Caesar’s commentaries.

Red meat, dairy, and chocolate could help relieve IBD
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims quite the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based protein and dairy treats could help relieve symptoms of sufferers of inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
While sufferers are usually advised to dodge meat and dairy to soothe their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found protein's essential amino acid tryptophan helps develop immune cells that foster a tolerant gut.
Lead investigator Dr Marco Colonna explained immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in the food don't sneak into the body.
Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance, protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
When the balance tilts too far toward inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can result.
In experiments it was found a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell appears in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their guts.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the cells' appearance.
Professor Colonna said: 'We established a link between one bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - that is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had.'
He suggested if the same works in humans, a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet may foster a more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environment.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas studying a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she discovered that one group of study mice had such cells but another group of the same strain but housed separately did not.
She suspected the difference had to do with the mice's gut microbiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live within the gastrointestinal tract.
The guts of the mice were DNA sequenced and it was found six bacterial species present in the mice with the immune cells but absent from the mice without them.
Mice reared in a sterile environment so they lacked a gut microbiome and do not develop this kind of immune cell were given L. reuteri and the immune cells arose.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and most of us shelter L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri induce the cells to develop in people as they do in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: 'The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially, high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may induce expansion of this population.'
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United have signed a 'genius' in Nemanja Matic
Manchester United have signed a "genius" in Nemanja Matic, believes Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The £40m signing from Chelsea started the 2-1 win in Dublin, United's final preseason game before the Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marauded forward at will.
However, having been left out of the Blues' preseason tour of Asia, Matic was severely lacking match fitness and only managed 45 minutes, something Mourinho admitted needed to be improved before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later."
As well as Matic, fellow new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started the game at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho started to shape his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted another three signings but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" of delivering three of his four priority signings.
"To get three out of four I thank the club for that," he added.
"I will be happier if they get me four of four but they did a great effort for me."
Chicken skin king Láďa Hruška is facing the challenge of his life.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
This multifaceted picture began to emerge thanks to the new show "Zdeňkova akademie" on TV Prima.
Hruška immediately grabbed his chance.
"Dear Zdeněk, I would like to apply to your cooking academy, because, hand on heart, I think I can learn a lot from you," he said in a video shared on social media.
And since the two of them have been quarrelling for several years, Láďa did not miss the opportunity to irritate afforded to him.
"In return, I can teach you the Znojmo way of cooking chicken meat, American cucumbers or invite you to go canoeing and show you why fried cheese is a favourite," provoked Hruška.
He's taking his participation in Pohlreich's new show very seriously.
It is time to move up a level and learn from the master.
"It's question of being a chef," he told Blesk.
Pohlreich did not comment because he was filming new episodes of his next show "Ano, šéfe!"
Prima has only reacted to Hruška's participation in the cooking academy by treating the whole thing as his personal activity outside of television.
Hruška dealt a severe blow to Pohlreich in December 2004 with his first recipe.
Within a few days, he had sold over 300 thousand copies!
The new show, which Prima presented yesterday at a press conference on the autumn broadcasting schedule, is a fully fledged cooking school.
Pohlreich selects his pupils from the audience, and will introduce them to 12 different cooking techniques across 12 episodes.

White House Prop Cost Taxpayers Thousands
The White House's decision to fly a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month cost taxpayers as much as $24,000, according to military records released to TIME.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the President is aboard, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House showcasing American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House Military Office requested the helicopter's presence in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for the "unusual" event, according to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to make sure you were aware because it's such an unusual high visibility event," the commander of HMX-1 emailed his superior, the Marine Deputy Commandant for Aviation, the day before the event.
The message indicated the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event, and remain until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that should the departure from the White House be delayed, a second aircrew would be needed for the return flight due to duty-hour restrictions.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while unit security personnel remained with the aircraft while it was the ground.
It was not clear from records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 inquired about whether the event might violate the provision.
"One question we asked was if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and were informed it was not," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you are locked," the Deputy Commandant replied.
The "Made in America" event was designated an official event by the White House, and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the President made a push for healthcare reform efforts then underway in the Senate and touted efforts to rein in government regulations.
Using the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But requisitioning their use solely for a photo-op is unusual.
Trump drew scrutiny in February when the presidential airplane taxied to the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Fla., and his Twitter account is flush with messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential aircraft.
"The White House is thrilled with the 'Made In America' showcase that featured products from all 50 states that are made by American workers with American materials," said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews frequently perform training flights around the Washington area and at the South Lawn to practice depositing the President of the United States at the White House with inches of precision.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight for the Made in America event counted toward the aircrew's training requirement for the month, an official said.
Unit helicopters also flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said taxpayers did not pick up the burden for any of the other props featured at the event.
A spokesperson for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in arranging for the helicopter to be displayed on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 doesn't maintain budgetary records for presidential flights, and determining the precise cost incurred by the event is difficult.
But according to Department of Defense hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Unit records record the aircraft flight time as 30 minutes each way from its home base at Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues the true cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
"To place a cost to taxpayers based on the reimbursement rate estimates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These rate estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other sunk costs that are included in annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do account for fuel, maintenance, and contracting costs.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to showcase this week things that are made in America," Spicer said.
"And I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our national security, that there are, I assume, hundreds if not thousands of people whose job depends on that.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans worked tirelessly to do.
So, of course, it's appropriate to highlight that."
It wasn't clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he toured the South Lawn for the event, but he did step into the driver's seat of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives, joking with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said, "I have three of them."
Young woman gets stuck in a swamp at Lake Mácha and the police wade in after her.
The girl set off to the beach at around 2 o'clock in the morning on Sunday.
Instead of swimming, she got trapped in the wetlands.
When she decided to call the police with her mobile phone, she had just 12 percent of battery left.
"Because of that, the police soon lost contact with her," shared police spokesperson Ivana Baláková.
Several police patrols went to the site she described, but finding the young woman was no easy task.
"Some of the police officers had to wade through reed marshes for hundreds of metres before they felt the ground under their feet again," stated Baláková.
And yet she was still missing.
The police officers orientated themselves according to the direction of her call for help.
"In order not to miss this connection at least, they agreed with her that they would count out loud," the spokesman said.
Police found the woman at 4:15 in the swamps of Borny.
She was at the end of both her physical and mental strength, and showed signs of hypothermia.
As a result, she was taken to the Českolipská hospital by ambulance.
Is there a link between Dědka and STAN?
From sought-after bride to sales girl.
There's a touch of irony involved.
With his web project hledameslusny.cz, it seems like the billionaire would essentially like to tell voters that STAN is suffering from a lack of suitable people.
And he also stated that the politically disparate group of lesser-known mayors and independents does not actually have a nationwide programme for the parliamentary elections.
After an interview with Dědek, its electoral candidate will be a proper person, whatever their political opinion.
Vít Bárta also started once, and it did not work out well.
In his pursuit of decent people and personalities that will potentially replace some of the mayors as candidates, as even Gazdík conceded, Dědek is also dismissing the favourite argument of the head of STAN that the movement's greatest value lies precisely in the political scrutiny and experienced of the mayors, who are traditionally the most popular politicians, an idea also confirmed by the polls.
They are now being casually replaced the newly acquired unknown figures.
Gazdík explained the total break with the KDU, after which STAN changed its logo and slogan, by claiming the movement does not want to waste its identity on KDU candidates.
However, if STAN's identity was only doubted by a few people, the simple identity game has ended with Dědek's arrival on the scene.
Gazdík has not only defined himself against Andrey Babiš's ANO party for a long time, in their first joint press conference Dědek, who publicly praises Babiš, stated: "My goal is for the ANO movement, the Starostové movement, to gains 20 percent in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope that the movement didn't take it the wrong way.
Dědek is a successful entrepreneur and billionaire, and certainly not by chance.
He often talks about politics just like Babiš, but unlike him he does not his his own political brand.
For some time now, STAN has been acting more like a reality show than a real political party, and Dědek's helping hand seems to be making a shop assistant out of a sought-after bride.
STAN went with TOP 09 for a while, then with the KDU and it is now looking for appropriate people to make a change.
Let's hope they click with someone.
The Chinese Room, and What It Takes to Build a Mind
In the past several decades, computer scientists and artificial intelligence researchers have made great progress in developing computer programs with the ability to mimic processes of human cognition.
With increasing speed, complexity, and processing power, these programs show a striking resemblance to the human mind.
Some even claim these technologies further emphasize the analogies between the functioning of the human brain and the functioning of digital computers and promote a functionalist conception of the mind.
Within philosophy of mind, functionalism is a doctrine generally stating that what makes something a mental state does not rely on its physical composition, but solely on its function, or the role it plays within a larger cognitive system.
All forms of functionalism, in one way or another, claim that mental states are those states which are causally related to so-called inputs, outputs and internal roles - or in other words, sensory stimulations, behavior and other mental states.
In his 1980 essay, Minds, Brains and Programs, philosopher John Searle questions the functionalist conception of the mind by asking, what psychological and philosophical significance should we attach to recent efforts at computer simulations of human cognitive capacities?
Generally speaking, functionalist theories of the mind hold that if two things such as human brains and digital computers are functionally similar, they are also psychologically similar.
Searle rejects this claim by arguing appropriately programmed computers with the right inputs and outputs are not minds, and cannot be said to understand and have mental states in the same way humans can.
Using what is called the Chinese Room counterexample, Searle attempts to show the absurdity of functionalism by giving an example of a system that is functionally similar to the human mind, but different he believes psychologically.
Searle hopes to describe a scenario in which all plausible versions of functionalism agree that understanding of Chinese - and hence mental states exist, but our intuitions prevent us from believing so.
Searle's counterexample has been extensively critiqued since it was described in 1980, and many replies to the Chinese Room are included in Minds, Brains and Programs.
I believe two of these replies, the Systems Reply and the Robot Reply, provide the best forum for exploring the strengths and weaknesses of Searle's argument against functionalism.
Through my analysis of the Systems Reply, I intend to show that no digital computer could ever understand any human language because doing so would require semantic ability beyond the capacity of the computer.
I will also use the Systems Reply as a means to clarify which functional roles are important for understanding, and therefore important for having mental states in general.
I believe that Searle's argument ultimately fails to invalidate functionalism because it does not describe a functional duplicate to the human mind.
Using an embellished version of the Robot Reply, I will show that the Chinese Room as described by Searle does not have the kind of causally interactive internal roles we associate with minds, and therefore poses no threat to functionalism.
Searle begins Minds, Brains and Programs by describing a program, developed by Roger Schank, with the ability to simulate the human capacity to understand stories.
A characteristic of this capacity lies in our ability to answer questions about information not explicitly stated in the stories.
Schank's machines can similarly answer questions in this fashion […] to do this they have a representation of the sort of in formation that human beings have, which enables them to answer such questions given the stories
Using Schank's program as a model, Searle's Chinese Room counterexample to functionalism goes as follows. Searle asks us to imagine an English-speaking man, who I will call Hal, sitting alone in a room.
Hal has absolutely no understanding of Chinese, and would be unable for that matter to distinguish Chinese characters from meaningless scribbles.

Proposal to Change Layout and Processes in the Midville Academy Cafeteria:
Reducing Long Lines, Confusion, Congestion, Discomfort, and Safety Hazards
Introduction
Due to the increased enrollment, Midville Academy has expressed concern regarding overcrowding in the cafeteria.
As a result of the long wait lines, students cannot get their food and eat them in the allocated time.
Overcrowding also causes confusion, congestion, discomfort, and safety hazards.
Students and parents want the situation improved.
To solve this problem, Midville Academy has decided to use the donated funds from several community businesses to expand the cafeteria into the adjacent outdoor area.
The Academy wants to know two expanded cafeteria layouts – one by changing a lot and another by changing less of the current situation.
Changes should maintain a comfortable and open atmosphere in the expanded cafeteria.
In addition, the Academy wants to know the best expansion layout, as well as improved processes of getting lunches to achieve more efficiency and safety.
The Academy also wants to know the reduction in the waiting time in lines, the amount of trash, and the number of dirty trays left for the custodians to clean up after each lunch period.
Consultant Experts Inc. (CEI) will examine the current layout and processes by collecting data on site.
CEI will also conduct surveys and interviews.
CEI will analyze the data, survey statistics and interview results to develop improved processes and two expanded cafeteria layouts.
CEI will measure the effectiveness of these changes by conducting simulations.
CEI will compare the simulation results for the reduction in line waiting times, amount of trash, and number of dirty trays left.
Based on the analysis, CEI will outline the advantages and disadvantages of each layout, and propose on a recommendation on the best layout to implement.
This proposal presents CEI’s plan for solving the overcrowding issue, including a detailed project definition, an action plan, and a project schedule.
Background
Currently, Midville Academy has about 900 students, and will close enrollment between 950 and 1000 students.
There are 225 students who use the cafeteria in each of the 4 lunch periods.
Students can choose to eat their lunch in the cafeteria or in the adjacent outdoor area if the weather is warm and dry.
However, the 4000 sq-ft cafeteria and 2000 sq-ft outdoor area were designed to accommodate only up to 160 students at a time.
The existing processes in the cafeteria aim for students to get food either from the salad bar or buffet station, eat their food, and drop-off dirty trays within 24 minutes.
If students want to purchase hot lunch, they line up near the doorway to the outdoor eating area, and then walk along in a buffet style line to select their food.
Students receive the food on ceramic dishes and silverware placed on a plastic tray.
Then they pay at the cash register at the end of the buffet line and find a place to eat.
If students want to get salad, they pay at the cash register near the doorway to the outdoor eating area.

Police dogs trained in helicopter flights in Most
Dogs specialised in hunting explosives and search dogs were trained in a helicopter flight over Most lake today.
Police dogs must not be cowardly or scared of flying, said Petr Tomášek, head of police cynologists for the Ústí nad Labem region.
Police dog training takes around two years.

In addition to the standard training, which involves being exposed to specimens of explosives around the lake and looking for a lost figurine, all 12 animals had to board the helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
The dogs had to get to work to as soon as the helicopter landed so that they didn't have problems with it moving.
"The helicopter lands, then the dog goes and starts searching immediately," said Tomášek.
Dogs that that are upset or unable to start working as the helicopter flies are excluded from training.

If the dog is healthy and not timid, they take the first test at 20 months.
"It takes about two and a half to three years to get a precise aim," Tomášek added.
Their time in the police service depends on the dog's health.
Most of them remain for around 8 to 10 years.

Educational Autobiography
My high school is a combination of three different neighborhoods: Huntington Woods, Oak Park, and Berkley.
My neighborhood, Huntington Woods, is of the highest socio-economic status and a primarily Caucasian neighborhood, while the other neighborhoods tend to fluctuate and have much more diversity in religion, social economic status, and race.
While my preschool, elementary school, and middle school classes were untracked, I am now aware of the discriminatory practices that occurred in my high school and the segregation that occurred within most extracurricular activities.
Better communication between the administration, counselors, teachers, extracurricular group coordinator, and fellow students could lead to positive educational reforms and an overall better environment for learning about academic material and learning about one’s own self.
Since I was in elementary school, I traveled to middle school and high school with fellow students from my neighborhood.
In high school most of the students from my neighborhood tended to join all of the honors classes, which not as many students from the other neighborhoods attended.
Recently I have realized that the friends I have made from the other neighborhoods, whom take honors classes, tend to know everyone in the senior class.
On the other hand, I hardly knew half of my own classmates when hearing everyone’s names at graduation because there were not many other students from Oak Park or Berkley that joined me in my honors classes or my extracurricular activities.
Pedro Noguera pointed out that these behaviors may not have been by coincidence, racial separation is not limited to the clustering that occurs outside of the school.
It shows up in classrooms and clubs throughout the school, and these forms of separation are not voluntary.
Rather, they are products of the school’s sorting practices and its structure (Noguera, 65).
While I enjoy meeting all types of people from different cultures, I tended to get to know and be friends with the people I was around the most.
I did meet some students from other activities such as tutoring and sports; however, generally I spent most of my time and found most of my friends in the marching band and within my classes.
While I was unaware of this situation at the time, there was a form of tracking present in my school district.
Tracking can be hard to point out, although the separations created by tracking—the practice of sorting students into courses based on some measure or estimate of their academic ability (Oakes, 1985)—are less visible, their impact on student outcomes is far more profound (Noguera, 65).
While tracking can be hard to see, there were negative consequences of the tracking that occurred in my high school.
School systems need to be aware of the dangers of tracking and consciously work to stop segregating students based on their neighborhood, socioeconomic status, religion, or race.
Tracking not only hurts the members of the lowest track, it also hurts members of the upper track, one conclusion emerges clearly: no group of students has been found to benefit consistently from being in a homogeneous group (Oakes, 7).
I learned this lesson during my senior year of high school when my Spanish teacher created the concept of a link student for two students in her classroom.
Being a link student entailed coming to class everyday for a Spanish class, which I have already taken, and tutoring two students during the entire class period as the teacher instructs the entire class in Spanish.
On the first day of class I was very apprehensive because I realized that the entire class was Caucasian and the two students I was asked to tutor were African American.
I was at first worried that the two students would resent my help or wonder why they were being singled out from the rest of the class.
However, despite my fears, I decided to treat them the same as I would treat any person I tutor and just help them both the best I could.
Fortunately, I was accepted by the students right away.
During the first semester they had given up trying to understand what the teacher was trying to say in Spanish, students in low-track classes have been found to have lower aspirations and more often to have their plans for the future frustrated (Oakes, 8).
Rather than continuing down a path of frustration, their teacher made adjustments and found a way that they could get extra help.
They appreciated my extra assistance and did not seem uncomfortable from being singled out.
Tutoring these students was a great experience not only for them, because they now understood the subject matter better, but also for me.

Content, Context, and Purpose:
Rethinking Academic Writing About Sexualized Violence
Overview
Despite increased public discourse and testimony about sexualized violence, we know very little about the ways these narratives circulate in college classrooms.
This study will explore the content of and contexts in which women write about sexualized violence in the college classroom.
The purpose of this study is twofold: 1) to discover the conditions under which students choose to write about sexualized violence and 2) to map the discursive practices and rhetorical strategies students use when writing these texts.
I will use thematic and discourse analysis to analyze student writing, interviews, and focus group conversations.
The knowledge gained from this analysis will allow me to complicate mainstream accounts of trauma that pathologize survivors.
In so doing, I hope to 1) theorize a pedagogical model that accommodates, rather than censors or pathologizes, students who write about sexualized violence and 2) build a case for critiquing the ways in which narratives of sexual violence are deployed in a range of public discourses.
Topic and Purpose
In the last thirty years, there has been a proliferation of survivor narratives in popular culture, mass media, literature, and American courtrooms (Doan, 2005).
Given this, it is no surprise that survivor narratives and themes have begun to make their way into the college classroom.
These narratives appear in courses focused on theoretical and clinical considerations of trauma, as well as literature and history classes (Miller, 2001).
The growing number of gender studies classes has also brought statistics, theories, and narratives of gender violence into the classroom (Haswell, 2005).
Courses that include themes of trauma and violence will increase the number of student essays engaging these issues (Miller, 2001).
There is also evidence that students write about sexualized violence even when there is nothing in the course material or writing prompts to encourage such writing (Payne, 2000).
Despite the increased public attention to sexualized violence, we know very little about how it functions in the writing of college students.
There is no denying that, while the feminist project of consciousness-raising has added significantly to public knowledge about sexualized violence, it is still a taboo topic (Gilmore, 2003).
When women, and perhaps especially students, do write about sexualized violence, their work is often associated with the confessionary or therapeutic modes of discourse that many commercial and juridical survivor narratives adopt (Payne, 2000).
Teachers of composition may be particularly predisposed to pathologize students who write about sexualized violence.
The debates about personal writing that emerged out of the writing process movement in the 90’s contribute to this pathologizing, for much of the scholarly conversation centered on whether or not personal writing turns the teacher-student relationship into that of a patient-therapist (Tobin, 1993).
As a result, composition teachers are often threatened or anxious when they encounter writing that narrates traumatic experiences because they assume they must adopt a therapeutic position (Payne, 2000).
In this way, the student-survivor is read as disordered and vulnerable, no matter how she composes her texts or what she argues about her experiences (Payne, 2000).
There is a need, therefore, for transformative research that challenges the normative trauma storyline.
That is, we need research that demonstrates the variety of discursive and rhetoric strategies and multiple storylines that student-survivors utilize in their writing about sexualized violence.
This must be done in a way that does not pathologize or universalize the survivor-student, but attends to the specific meanings they make through their writing and in conversations about writing.
This study addresses this need by 1) sensitively reading academic student writing about sexualized violence and 2) discussing with these student-authors the rhetorical situations out of which these texts were produced.

Individual and Societal Determinants of Suicidal Behavior
Why do people commit suicide?
Is it because of an individual psychological defect, or have they simply become unable to resist massive social pressures? This paper analyzes census data on suicide rates in the German provinces and surrounding European countries to come to the conclusion that structural societal factors are indeed more powerful determinants of suicidal behavior.
Recommendations for further study and on-the-ground policy are also made.
Introduction
Suicide is the third leading cause of death for youth aged 10 to 24 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2002).
Women of all ages are three times as likely to attempt suicide in their lives as are men (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2004).
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control list family and community support as one of the key mechanisms for preventing suicide among those at risk (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2004).
Considering the above statistics and the federal government's attention to collecting them and offering suicide-prevention advice, we can see that suicide has been recognized as a social problem to which the government has allocated public funds to prevent.
The CDC goes on to recommend, however, that clinical care for mental and substance abuse disorders is also key to preventing suicide, thus suggesting that individual psychological factors can be at fault.
In this paper, I explore the relationship between suicide and individual versus social factors.
Specifically, I ask whether micro level psychological factors or macro level societal factors are more significant determinants of whether a person will commit suicide.
I hypothesize that social conditions, not psychological status, are more predictive of an individual's decision to take his own life.
Such research is valuable and relevant as part of a larger effort to determine what causes people to take their own lives and an attempt to mediate those provoking factors.
Literature Review
Because of the grave social and painful individual implications of suicide, it has been the subject of much study among scholars.
Many scholars believe that a persistent feeling of hopelessness is the driving force behind suicide in adults.
They define hopelessness more specifically than its colloquial usage.
Minkoff, in his work, describes it as, a feeling that nothing will turn out right, nothing will succeed, important goals are unattainable, and worst problems will never be solved (Handout, 2005).
Weishaar and Beck also focus on the role of hopelessness in suicide.
Many other scholars, including Beck, Pearson, Brown, Conaghan, Davidson, Heisel, Hill, and Uncapher further emphasize the role of hopelessness in causing suicide among specific populations, such as psychiatric patients and the elderly.
Related to theories centering on hopelessness is what are called the escape theory and the meaning-centered approach.
Both of these theoretical approaches discuss a particular manifestation of hopelessness as center to suicidality.
Escape theorists such as Baumeister and Hewitt posit that suicidal behavior results when a person perceives herself as failing or not meeting perfectionist goals.
This state of negative self-awareness leads to cognitive deconstruction (Handout, 2005) in which the person's judgment and inhibition falters and they choose suicide to escape their painful state of disappointment and self-perceived failure.
The meaning-centered approach similarly focuses on an individual's perception of her life.
Frankl and Linehan in particular propose that a person's will to live depends on their ability to find meaning in new life events.
Those who can find meaning even in negative events or suffering are thus less prone to suicide.
The medical profession has even gotten involved in the debate.
The Politicization of American Healthcare as seen in the Reauthorization of SCHIP and its Effects on the American Public
Introduction
The issue of health care in America has not always been at the heart of every political debate.
In a study conducted during the 2004 Presidential elections, although health care ranked higher in importance among voters than most other domestic issues, it was only fourth in importance in determining their vote for president, with affordability of health care and health care insurance being chosen as the specific health related issues of greatest concern (Blendon, et al. 2004).
However, health care has, at certain times, been extremely contentious and highly politicized, bringing it to the forefront of voters' attention.
A current prime example would be the bitter partisan debate between the Democrats and Republicans regarding the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), an extremely volatile issue precisely because it concerns the well being of society's most vulnerable – children.
SCHIP, which will be discussed in greater detail later, has brought forth a barrage of petty party bickering and accusations of politicization from both sides of the aisle.
This has led to much media criticism about the futility of such political theatre and rhetoric in addressing the problem at hand.
Thus, what sort of effects has the politicization of health care brought to the American people?
Have these disagreements paradoxically brought about more thoroughly analyzed policies and led to pragmatic and optimum compromises or has this political theatre and exaggerated rhetoric only served to impede the improvement of healthcare due to both parties' inability to cooperate and break the deadlock in political ideologies?
The link between the variables of politicization of healthcare and its effect on the public will thus be studied with SCHIP as its main case study.
Background
SCHIP was enacted as Title XXI of the Social Security Act by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 primarily to expand insurance coverage to low-income children living in families who earned too much to qualify for Medicaid but were yet unable to afford private insurance.
At that time, more than 10 million children lacked health insurance, with about seven million of them living in families with incomes below twice the federal poverty level (FPL).
Although 75 percent of those uninsured children lived in a family with at least a parent who had full-time employment, and 90 percent had one parent who was employed either full or part-time, their families were either not provided with job-based health insurance or lacked the finances to buy the insurance offered (Families USA).
Thus, Congress appropriated approximately $40 billion to fund the program for 10 years.
Although it was optional, within two years of SCHIP's inception, all fifty states had adopted the program to expand coverage for children.
Based on steadily rising enrollment in SCHIP, rates of uninsured children from low-income families have declined 2.2 million, from 23 percent in 1997 to 14.4 percent in 2004, and the program is seen as highly successful (Pediatrics).
However, in 2006 the U.S. Census Bureau reported that 9.4 million children in the U.S. did not have health coverage - one in eight being uninsured.
What this meant was that after six years of improvement in the rate of health coverage for children, the number of uninsured children has again begun increasing.
In 2006 alone, although SCHIP was found to provide health insurance coverage to 6.6 million children, there was found to be one million more uninsured children than two years ago (Pediatrics).
This set the stage for SCHIP to become a highly contentious issue and a political hotbed as children have always been perceived as political untouchables.
Thus, the reauthorization of SCHIP is a very charged one because it has been a highly popular program that has drawn bipartisan support in the past.

Unique brewery brews beer once again.
The newly revived brewery is back serving up good beer.
The passion and honesty of the new owners brought the brewery in Lobeč u Mšena back to life a few years ago.
The brewery was first commemorated in 1586 and has Renaissance foundations, and in the nineteenth century it was converted into a train depot.
This was followed by years of prosperity, when the brewery was especially famous for its dark beers.
Unfortunately, production was stopped during World War II and the brewery was nationalised in 1984.
After that, the buildings served as state property.
The demolition work was finished by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned site was devastated and stripped for building materials.
However, in 2007 new hopes emerged in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouza.
They began to repair the buildings with utmost respect for the spirit of the property, down to the smallest detail.
They devoted themselves to carefully studying archive documents in an attempt to retain the original materials and building elements.
The brewery has the same look as it did in the nineteenth century, when its golden era began.
Their work has been rewarded by a declaration from Ministry of Culture proclaiming the brewery to be a cultural monument, and the building has also become part of the European Industrial Heritage Trail.
In 2015, they festively revived the tradition of beer brewing.
If you want to sample a great beer from Lobeč in the scenic countryside around Kokořín, you can visit the pub in the brewery grounds.
When brewing the beer, they use water from the protected landscape area of Kokořín, malt from the fields in Lobeč and hops Žatec.
In the beer you, you can taste traditional light lager as well as dark beers and specialties.
Don't miss out on the tour of the brewery, which is held on Saturdays and Sundays at midday and 13:30.
The largest defensive fortress in Czechoslovakia?
One of the largest fortresses of its kind in the world?
This unique building was supposed to be the Stachelberg fortress between Trutnov and Žacléř, at the top of the ridge of terrain above the village of Babí.
Originally, it should have been formed of up to 12 bunkers connected by a cavernous underground area.
This was where the headquarters, barracks, ammunition, supplies, power generator, engine room and hospital would have been.
However, the Munich Agreement put an end to it.
In less than a year, it was only possible to build a single massive reinforced concrete bunker and the underground spaces cut off.
Thanks to enthusiasts from the Stachelberg society, who started to reconstruct the unique building in the early 1990, you can also see it for yourselves.
Seventy five percent of the underground area is already accessible!
In addition to the T-S 73 infantry cabin with an exhibition and the underground area, there is also an armed light fortification building, two deployed infantry cabins, trenches and a nature trail by "Opevněné Trutnovsko".
Refreshments, a homey alcove and breathtaking views of the region are guaranteed!
This unique and amazing Czech building has been on a list alongside such sights as the Great Wall of China, Trajan's harbour near Rome, or the Assyrian palaces in Nineveh and Nimrud.
The Chotěšov Monastery dates back to the beginning of the thirteenth century, and today it mainly consists of a stately four-wing convent building overlooking an exquisite garden.
Unfortunately, the list it belongs to is that of unique buildings that are in danger of collapse.
However, its devotees do not want to give up, and a lot of events are being held to support the monastery.
One of them is the annual dinner for the Chotěšov Monastery, which will take place on Saturday 5 August. Vladimír Mišík amd Ivan Hlas will perform, you can see fencing duels and look at the amazing huge buildings, which are usually inaccessible.
Above all, you can enjoy the atmosphere of this incredible place.

You will find out how the Neanderthals were able to cope perfectly with all sorts of extreme climate conditions, especially with the alternation of ice and inter-glacial ages.
Despite their simple material culture, they were extremely successful as the predators of their time.
You will also learn about their appearance, their anatomy, their technological and hunting skills, as well as their aesthetic sense.

School Study: Abbott Middle School
For my practicum this semester, I have been placed in a seventh grade social studies classroom in Abbott Middle School.
Abbott is located off of Orchard Lake Road in West Bloomfield, Michigan.
West Bloomfield is a large suburb located on the fringe of Detroit.
The population at the time of the 2000 census was 64,860.
The population breaks down to approximately 84% Caucasian, 8% Asian, 5% African American, and about 2% Hispanic. The median household income is $91,661, which is more than double that of the national statistic.
The number of violent crimes recorded by the FBI in 2003 was seventeen, and the number of homicides was zero.
West Bloomfield is similar to the suburb I grew up in just north of Chicago in Illinois, which makes for a relatively comfortable setting for me to complete my observations.
Abbott Middle School is comprised of sixth, seventh, and eighth grade and currently 779 students are enrolled: 268 sixth graders, 253 seventh graders, and 258 eighth graders.
There are 41 teachers at Abbott Middle School, making the student to teacher ration 19.
Teachers are generally paid well, averaging $61,319 per year.
388 of the enrolled students are female and 369 of the enrolled students are male.
In terms of racial diversity, Abbott’s student population consists of 557 white students, 123 African American students, 48 Asian students, 24 Hispanic students, and 5 American Indian students.
In terms of the socioeconomic status of the students, 79 students are eligible for a free lunch and 28 students are eligible for a reduced lunch despite the relatively high average household income of West Bloomfield.
In terms of test scores, Asian students at Abbott have the highest combined reading and math proficiency of any ethnicity at 97%. Whites have an 86.5% proficiency rating, multi-racial at 67.4%, and blacks at 63.6%.
Female proficiency in reading and math is slightly above male proficiency.
Economically disadvantaged students are 65% proficient, while students with disabilities have a 39% proficiency rating.
Social studies curriculum in Abbott Middle School follows a general geographic pattern.
In sixth grade social studies classes, students study the Western Hemisphere.
Students cover the Eastern Hemisphere in seventh grade, and eighth grade classes focus on the United States.
Students are required to take three full years of language arts, science, and mathematics in addition to social studies and then fill in the rest of their schedule with electives.
They are urged to take at least one semester of foreign language (the school offers Spanish, French, and Japanese) and a technology elective.
The school’s fine arts program is thoroughly developed both inside and outside of classes.
There are band, orchestra, choir, and theater classes offered as electives and the school puts on a memorable performance each year.
It is a fine arts program that the school is proud of, evidenced by the plentiful bulletin boards and photo galleries around the building.
This year the chosen play is AIDA.
The show is so popular that it takes place in the High School nearby so that more people are able to come and see the production.
The physical environment of the Abbott building contributes to the general atmosphere of the school.
The four main hallways form a large square, which makes navigation easy for students (as well as for observing teacher candidates).
All of the sixth graders have their lockers in the same hallway, which eliminates some of the intimidation they might have felt having their locker next to an eighth grader.
The facilities are modern and well maintained.
American Education: A Force for Democracy and Integration?
At its inception, the United States of America was a society unlike any other.
Its citizens were expected to take an active role in the legislative process, voting directly for their House representative, and indirectly for their Senators, vice president and president.
Furthermore, although restricted by current standards, the franchise was broad for the time, with no restrictions regarding social class, property ownership or birth rank – every free white man could vote.
Therefore, unlike countries such as England, which restricted the franchise severely for elections to the lower house, and had an inheritance-based system in the upper house, the United States needed a knowledgeable citizenry, one that could vote intelligently and thoughtfully for the new republic's legislatures.
At the same time, and equally important, was the need for the new republic to establish an identity, a way of making the new national motto, e plubibus unum – from many, one – a reality.
Education was seen as the mechanism to create that unum, promoting the principles of democracy, and paving the way for the pursuits of life, liberty, and happiness.
Through education, the diverse citizenry could become a single, integrated nation, one in which every member was capable of acting in an enlightened fashion for the good of all.
In the two hundred and thirty years since the Declaration of Independence was signed, education has continued to be called upon for these two functions: establishing and enabling democratic principles, and integrating the diverse and disparate constituencies of the United States.
The question, then, is whether education has been successful in these dual goals of promoting democracy and integration.
In this paper, I will argue that education has succeeded in one of these goals, integration, albeit only partially.
American education has frequently met its goal of integration, although that integration has, for the most part, focused on assimilation of immigrants and minorities into the dominant culture rather than the more two-way process the word integration might imply.
I will argue that American education has not met its goal of instilling the values of a democratic and pluralistic society, although it has frequently succeeded in creating the illusion of a meritocratic society where every person has the possibility of progressing according to his or her talents, education and effort.
American education, therefore, has frequently used the mask of democracy in education to hide a system in which the lower class and minority students are disproportionately likely to perform poorly in school, and upper and middle class whites are likely to perform better.
The New Republic:
1776 to 1830
The first argument that education was necessary for a democratic and pluralistic society came with the creation of the United States.
Although education had existed in the land that would become the United States, and in fact the first mandatory education act was passed in colonial times, it was not until the difficulties involved in dealing with Shay's Rebellion and the weaknesses in the Articles of Confederation came to light that the founders realized that a strong federal government, and with it a strong national identity, was needed.
With this realization came the first thoughts of education as a way of forging that national identity.
Therefore, in 1779, Thomas Jefferson proposed a bill for free schools in Virginia because
Citizens must choose leaders wisely, defeat ambition and corruption in politics, and protect liberty by keeping a vigilant eye on government.
All citizens should have a chance not only to vote but to be elected.
The government needs wise and honest laws, Jefferson argued, and thus it needs educated and virtuous lawmakers.
In a republic, these men must be chosen "without regard to wealth, birth or other accidental condition."
Identify plants with one click.
Students with a herbarium and ordinary plant lovers will be helped by the new free Pl@ntNet app.
Whenever someone is interested in which plant they have just encountered, they can find out about it from the application.
All they have to do is take a photo of the plant and the application will recognise the species.
The new application is available for both iOS and Android, and was presented on Tuesday by a representative of the CEEV Centra etické a environmentální výchovy (Centre for Ethical and Environmental Education) in Horský Park in Bratislava, as part of the Tajný život města (Secret Life of the City) project.
The project also involved pupils from 50 Czech and Slovak schools, who took pictures of plants from their surroundings with their teachers to add to the application database.
The newly created French application is free to download from the Tajný život města website.
The main goal of French programmers was to encourage as many people as possible to contribute their images to the app, thereby increasing the number of plants it can recognise.
"Children can go out into the forest with a tablet or mobile phone in their hands," said Ivana Poláčková, the coordinator of the project.
Starting from sufficiently high quality photos of a flower, leaf or fruit, the app can find its name in a few seconds, which will then appear under the photo in both Czech and Slovak.
The French allowed the application to be translated into Slovak and Czech as part of the Tajný život města project.
As such, users are welcome to add plants that do not yet appear in the database once they have created an account.
"The French will determine whether it is useful and then add it to the database," said Poláčková.

In this question, I’ll do the second task first since the answers for this part could lay the background I need to complete the first task.
I’ll present and compare the theories of Saussure, Durkheim, and Alexander in this part.
Basically, this set of question is about epistemology, asking us how theorists answer the question of how we think and why we seem obliged to think in certain ways.
Before diving into Saussure’s theories, it is noteworthy to mention that although Saussure’s Courses in General Linguistics is about linguistics, he lucidly argues that signs are part of social life, and his theories could shed light on the understanding of other parts of social life, such as rites and customs (de Saussure, Bally and Sechehaye 1983, p.15, 17).
For Saussure, individuals are pre-dated by the cultural structure--a system of shared cultural codes.
Accordingly, how individuals think/feel/characterize the world are based on, constrained and influenced by this very underlying structure.
This view led Saussure to emphasize the study the interrelationship of symbols, signs, meanings within the cultural structure, and to downplay the research into individual acts.
In Chapter three of Courses in General Linguistics, Saussure distinguishes social from individual as well as essential from ancillary or accidental by distinguishing language itself and speech.
He makes it very clear that: Language is not a function of the speaker.
It is the product passively registered by the individuals.
It never requires premeditation.
Speech, on the contrary, is an individual act of the will and the intelligence.
In order to express his own thoughts, individuals must use the code provided by the language (de Saussure, Bally and Sechehaye 1983, p.13-14)”
Thus, social conditions individuals by providing a form of thinking and speaking.
Clearly, he rejects the dominant approach of individual psychology at his time, which focuses on the impacts of individual metal world, motional world on people’s perception of world.
His thoughts are also dialectically distinct from the Existialism, which rises after his time and accentuates individual freedom, choices, and responsibilities.
In addition to stressing the influence of cultural structure on individuals, he argues that the linguistic system is built by social convention, and thus brought social convention to the epicenter of the study of linguistics.
His ideas regarding the arbitrary nature of signs reflect his emphasis on social convention.
In Courses in General Linguistics, Sassure first rejects nomenclature, which regards a language, if reduced to its essentials, is a list of terms corresponding to a list of things.
(de Saussure, Bally and Sechehaye 1983, p.65) Then he presents his first principle of linguistics: the linguistic sign--link between signal and signification-- is arbitrary (de Saussure, Bally and Sechehaye 1983, p.67).
In other words, there is no natural or inevitable relationship between the signifier and the signified, and there is no fixed universal concept.
The relationship between the signified and the signifier is created by social activity (de Saussure, Bally and Sechehaye 1983, p.11).
Thus, signs are the product of social convention.
This thought anticipates Kuhn, and is a critique of Essentialism, according to which everything has essential characteristics.
In fact, his playing priority to synchronic study of language over the diachronic study of language is closely connected to his thoughts on the arbitrariness of the signs.
Precisely because signs are arbitrary, we could only study language from the internal relationship within the language system, and to study this relationship requires us to study them at a given time and within a given society.
Most importantly, the arbitrariness of the sign does not only refer to the arbitrary relationship between the signifier and the signified, but also refer to the arbitrary relationship between signs in a language system.
Actually, signs are the concepts, categories, and, values by which a community uses to organize its world.
Because of the arbitrariness of the signs, it would be meaningless to isolate a single sign from the united whole system to which it belongs (de Saussure, Bally and Sechehaye 1983, p.112).
Saussure argues that the language itself can be nothing other than a system of pure values (de Saussure, Bally and Sechehaye 1983, p.110).
GMB concern over investment at McVitie's Glasgow factory
A union is seeking reassurance from managers at biscuit maker McVitie's over its long-term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company had been silent over the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 people work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.
McVitie's owner Pladis said it had invested more than £5m at the site in the last few years.
It added employees and union representatives "will be the first to know" if there were any changes to its operations.
In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland called on McVitie's to "address concerns that funding is not being brought forward for the modernisation of production lines."
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot get clarity from the general site manager over the business needs and investment plan for the future of Tollcross is deeply concerning our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is highly concentrated in the local community and the greater Glasgow area, a crucial pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
So, from the perspective of jobs, pay and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic manufacturing decline, the east end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie's."
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The site manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will be responding directly as we value ongoing engagement with employees and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago at which a number of issues were discussed openly.
We discussed with employees then that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we review our operations on an ongoing basis - and that applies across our all our businesses and sites - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested over £5m in our Tollcross site, notably on production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a manufacturing site and should there be any changes to our operations at the site, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."

Did PSG warn Barcelona about move for Neymar three years ago?
La Liga side may rue their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after lodging a £189m offer to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world-record raid three years ago?
The sensational approach has lit up the summer transfer window, with the Ligue 1 club ready to break the world transfer record by more than double the previous mark, which saw Paul Pogba return to Manchester United last season for £89m.
Once completed, the move will see Neymar become the world's most expensive player and also the highest-paid professional sportsman in the world, with PSG offering wages of over £500,000-a-week after tax.
Barcelona are known to be furious with the manner of the approach and the way that Neymar has forced his way out, despite a source close to the Catalans' board insisting that the club have always done their best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club looking to sign one of PSG's best players.
"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, they'll face consequences."
Barcelona appear to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing an interesting in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italy international to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could well be feeling the repercussions of that interest by losing one of their prize assets in Neymar.

In 2000, there were 32.8 million Latinos/Latinas residing in the United States, representing 12% of the total U.S. population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2002), and there were more than 10.2 million Asians living in the United States (U.S.
Bureau of the Census, 2004) of which 1.2 million were of Korean decent representing 11% of the total Asian population (U.S.
Bureau of the Census, 2004).
A large proportion of Latinos/as are under the age of 18 (Smokowski&amp;
Bacallao, 2006), representing the fastest growing group of young people in the US (Chapa&amp; Valencia, 1993).
Latina adolescent girls make up 15.2 % of all the girls in the United States, constituting the largest minority group of girls in the U.S. (COSSMHO, 1999).
As Latinos/as and Korean Americans become part of the U.S. society, there is a great need to understand how Latino and Korean American adolescents adapt to American culture.
Methodological Considerations
While Latino/a and Asian populations vary tremendously in terms of nationality, migration histories, language, cultural nuances, levels of experienced discrimination, class, socioeconomic status, skin color, reasons for immigration, and educational level, research conducted with these groups tend to generalize findings from one subgroup (e.g.
Mexican American or Chinese American) to the larger group (e.g.
Latinos/Latinas or Asian American) (Smith, 2004).
However, generalizations that are often made across ethnic minority subgroups can be at times inaccurate and misleading (Umaña-Taylor&amp;
Fine, 2001).
For example, while 36% of Mexican households are composed of five or more people, only 14% of Cuban households are composed of five or more people (Thierren&amp; Ramirez, 2000).
Despite these within-group differences, generalizations like the following are commonly made;
Hispanics live in family households that are larger than those of non-Hispanic Whites (Umaña-Taylor et. al., 2001) providing misleading descriptions of Latino/a subgroups.
There is a similar tendency to make brought generalizations in psychological research with cultural minorities.
For example, in one study, Zady (2002) compared Colombian, Cuban in private schools, Cuban in public schools, Mexican, and Nicaraguan 8th and 9th graders in regard to self-esteem.
They found that these groups differed significantly in their predictors of self-esteem suggesting that Latino adolescents adapt differently to different circumstances which warrants attention to within-group differences.
In addition to acknowledging demographic variations, special attention to within-group differences is needed in terms of measure development, norming, (Umaña et. al, 2001) and utilization.
For example, measures that are developed for research with Mexican Americans may not necessarily be applicable with other Latino/a national groups, and measures developed for Chinese Americans may not be applicable for Korean Americans.
Yet, many researchers conducting research with Latino and Asian populations utilize the same measure across subgroups because of the lack of culture or group specific measures rendering some research results questionable.
This is particularly true when measuring cultural values.
For example, in a study investigating the role of cultural values on the mental health of Korean adolescents, Hovey, Kim,&amp; Seligman (2006) utilized the Asian Value Scale to measure adherence to Asian cultural values in general but not Korean cultural values specifically.
Future research studies should aim at developing and testing standardized group or culture-specific measures for research with both Latinos/as and Korean Americans.
For more than 1600 years a Church has stood on the site of St. Albans Abbey, which was once recognised as the premier Abbey of England . . . . but the interest of St. Albans does not consist in its buildings alone.
Time was, for instance, when the nation cared nothing for the education of the people, but here in St. Albans–at least from the time of Edward the Confessor–an educational ladder was in existence by means of which children of the humblest origin might rise, and some of them did rise, to the highest position in Church and State. . . . .
Again, from a military point of view, St. Albans from prehistoric times down at least to the Wars of the Roses, seems always to have been considered a place of supreme importance.
Examples can be found here of ancient British, Roman, and Mediaeval fortifications.
There are recorded visits of almost every English Sovereign from William the Conqueror to Queen Elizabeth.
A visit to St. Albans should do something to arouse renewed interest in the Church and State to which we are proud to belong.
There are not many towns in the land whose records tell more about the story of the English people.
—The Alban Guide to the Cathedral and Abbey Church, 1936
In this passage from a twentieth century guidebook, the abbey of St. Alban’s is figured as a long-standing bastion of education that has persisted through and has been built up by various empires on English soil.
Certainly, we can read the mention of the various sovereigns’ visits to the Abbey as a pressuring appeal to tourists:
Hey, if Queen Elizabeth could make it to the abbey, shouldn’t you?
But what interests me in this excerpt is the way in which Church, State, St. Alban’s, and the people are all portioned out as either opposing or allied elements in the history of England.
The populace is fully distinct from the nation, [which] cared nothing for the education of the people, but St. Alban’s has countered such national negligence by educating children even of the humblest origin and pushing them up the social ladder to the highest position in Church and State.
The guidebook looks to St. Alban’s as the glue that has held the nation together—in both the past and the present.
Such phrases as For more than 1600 years a Church has stood and St. Alban’s . . . seems always to have been considered a place of supreme importance suggest a historical continuity in the material existence and public perception of the abbey itself.
And in the present, a mere visit to the abbey will arouse the people’s renewed interest in the Church and State ; the abbey will consolidate all these disparate (and sometimes opposed) elements of England.
Ultimately, the site tell[s] more about the story of the English people —both past and present—than any other locale.
But because the rhetoric of this passage serves to promote tourism rather than interrogate St. Alban’s role as a national symbol, some interesting issues and tensions go unacknowledged.
If the people have always perceived St. Alban’s as unifying force in the nation, why do they need to renew their interest by visiting?
Does this call for renewal suggest a discontinuity in St. Alban’s history of representing the Church and State, or is this renewal a sort of performance, a reaffirmation of the site’s continued importance for the people and nation?
Does the move to assert the primacy of the region— There are not many [other] towns in the land —support or destabilize the notion of a larger Church and State unified by St. Alban’s? And is the church important for its materiality—its physical existence—or for the textuality it has engendered, the records that tell the story of the English people ?

Hobbes, Durkheim, and Spencer:
On the Emergence of a Supra-individual Realm
The formation and development of a supra-individual realm and the relationship between supra-individual entities and individuals have been continuous topics of discussion in the field of sociology.
The purpose of this paper is to examine some of the arguments made by Hobbes, Durkheim, and Spencer on these issues.
They viewed the society and the state as concrete forms of the supra-individual realm, and conceived their theories around these two distinct supra-individual entities.
Following that point, this paper will discuss how these authors view emergence of a society and the state with regard to their relationships with individuals.
The analysis is primarily based on the texts we read, but I will also try to address the historical contexts of their theories when it is useful to better understand the theories.
Hobbes
Hobbes was one of the forerunners who pondered the reasons for the formation of the state [Hobbes used the term the common-wealth to indicate the supra-individual realm he pictured (Hobbes, Leviathan: 87), but I will use the term state instead, to be consistent with Durkheim and Spencer].
He tried to explain the emergence of the state in regard to the nature of man and his relationship with other men in society.
Before we examine his thoughts, let's briefly look at the background of his work.
He lived in an era in which England was going through a political chaos due to civil war.
Radical parties were against absolute monarchism and tried to establish a constitution-based government (Chung, 1979).
Hobbes was interested in preserving the authority of the monarch against the persistent threats, on the one hand, from the Roman Catholic Church and, on the other hand, from radical constitutionalism (Kim, 1999).
His Leviathan emerges from this chaotic situation.
In Leviathan, Hobbes first explores the reason why people fight against each other by deliberating on the nature of man.
In the book, he states that every man is equal in strength and mind and, accordingly, cherishes equal hopes in attaining his personal ends (Hobbes, Leviathan: 63).
These ends are specified as gain, safety, and reputation.
In order to achieve these ends, people cannot help fighting against each other.
This causes the state of [war], as is of every man, against every man and in this situation, Hobbes claims, there is no way for any man to secure himself (p.64).
Hobbes' claim that man cannot secure himself in the nature is based on two premises: 1) each man fights for his own desire; 2) one cannot achieve permanent dominance over another because men are basically equal in strength and thus have the ability to kill each other.
These assumptions are central in his argument for the formation of the state.
Another reason that brings about the formation of the state comes from people's genuine desire to end the state of war and achieve peace.
People may wonder how this desire for peace arises from the stage of war of all against all.
Hobbes' explanation is that people are afraid of being killed in the state of war.
Such desire of people to obtain peace and security generates the agreement among people to erect a common power.
The only way to erect such power, Hobbes maintains, is for the people to [confer] all their power and strength upon one Man, or upon one Assembly of men.
He states that after such election of one man or one assembly of men is done, and people agree to give up their right to that Man, the multitude is united in one person, and this state is called common-wealth (89).
Hobbes's argument gives us a useful framework to view the emergence of the state in relations to the nature of men, whether his assumption about the nature of men is true or not.

I'm sorry, Mr...comrade superintendent, but...but I greeted you with a normal, everyday greeting.
He says he'd like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Fear of a recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Transport for London is not amused by this flyposting "vandalism."
I do not think that they have to do something like this.
According to an architect, its regional plan resembles Manhattan in New York.
The authorities intend to implement the new measures, which will allow them to track their location within six months.
A further positive aspect of regular exercise is the fact that patients can check what all they can do, strengthening their self-confidence.
He had a dispute with commissaires yesterday ahead of the qualification ride, when officials summoned him to measure his height.

There were beads of sweat on his temples and he was blinking nervously, as if he himself was being vetted.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does the political penalty have broadly understandable rules?
Donald Trump approved the anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the US imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Madura.
And the day before that, Trump wrote that China is doing nothing about the North Korean threat and that it can't go on.
His concept of sanctions is slightly wet behind the ears.
These things can't be lumped together.
Madura's Venezuela has indeed set out on the road to dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China is just not behaving in the way the American president would like.
Russia is a whole chapter in itself.
But if anyone wanted to sum it all up so that even a common voter, whether American, European or other, would understand what the system of rules and the sanction policy are based on, it would be almost impossible.
With the sanctions against Russia, President Trump is only following through on what President Obama put into place. He is simply the one to give them the official stamp.
So why such a fuss?
Last year, Europe was frightened that if that American elections went in favour of Trump, he would embrace Putin and remove the sanctions.
It was a terrible prospect.
In practice, the opposite turned out to be the case, however.
Trump has not relaxed the sanctions, but actually tightened them.
But Europe is even more scared.
German Minister Zypries says that Trump's sanctions violate international law.
Are the sanctions approved by the UN Security Council really kosher?
But then, the EU's anti-Russian sanctions aren't kosher either.
European Commission chief Juncker is once again complaining that Trump's sanctions are threatening the EU's energy security.
Does that mean that only sanctions that are too weak to threaten anyone should be used?
The common voter is left in the dark.
For three years they heard that the fate of anti-Russian sanctions depends solely on the fulfilment of the Minsk agreement concerning Ukraine.
It is understood that it is actually about the EU's energy security.
The voter is more in the dark than ever.
Russia is penalised for meddling where it shouldn't.
China is berated for not meddling enough.
The Venezuelan President is punished for building a dictatorship within the borders of his own country.
All these punishments and considerations have their own rationality.
But can anyone see a system, order or rule?
Andrej Babiš: I will not consider cooperation with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš got married, toured the Republic with his visionary book and finalised the electoral programme.
Except for the Pardubice Region, all the candidates have already been prepared.
To use his own words, he did not interfere with them in any way.
He even agreed to allow "hejtman" (marshall) and Shadow Education Minister Ivo Vondrák lead the Moravian-Silesian region.
"But if he is successful, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a member of parliament or hejtman," Babiš stated earlier, confirming his viewpoint.
You have upset a lot of representatives and national politicians with the idea that directly elected mayors and chief magistrates should manage municipalities and towns on their own, only using managers.
Do you really mean it?
That isn't how it was.
I am a supporter of direct democracy. We elect the president directly and I am convinced that it should be the same for mayors and chief magistrates.
I don't talk about abolishing the representatives in my book, they can stay there comfortably.
There question is how many of them there should be.
During the presentation of your book "O čem sním, když náhodou spím" (What I Dream About When I Happen to Sleep), I heard you speak about the abolition of representation with my own ears.
I don't remember that.
I spoke about direct elections and reducing the number of representatives.
There are nine million inhabitants in New York, which has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague has 1.2 million citizens and 1171 representatives.
And the mayor is making a fuss that little is being built and there are no great projects planned, but she is not competent in that regard.
The same applies to the government, which has only been governed by two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
I'm not saying they did that well.
The current prime minister isn't guiding anything, he only moderates the debate.
It can't work that way.
Is that why you want to push through the majority system?
It would be ideal, but it is difficult to enforce.
The only change we have in the plan is the one-round election to the Senate.
We have also proposed a sliding mandate for ministers and an amendment to the regulations governing the Chamber of Deputies, to prevent unnecessary attendance by members of parliament, who should mainly be working on committees and panels instead of Chamber meetings.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents are afraid of.
That you will rule the government like a dictator, control the Chamber of Deputies with 101 deputies, abolish the counties and the Senate, and control the whole country through the grateful mayors and magistrates.
That is certainly not the case.
There is nothing wrong with debating the number of representatives.
The French President Macron announced that he was reducing the legislative board by a third, and there are 57,000 French people per one legislator, whereas here the ratio is 17,000 Czechs to one.
Nobody accused Macron of endangering democracy, however.
Even if somebody won the majority vote in the Czech Republic, we have mechanisms in place to prevent them from making dramatic changes.
The temptation is great for those who have the parliamentary majority. Just look at Poland or Hungary.
Nothing of the sort applies to the ANO movement.
We just need a team in government that will work for the people, not for their parties or departments.
I do not understand why we have not even been able to agree on increasing wages for teachers and workers in the cultural and social services.
Why did they vote for me and add 21 percent to GIBS members who already have 60 thousand?
Would you clamp down on that as prime minister?
The prime minister has to intervene when the ministers behave wastefully, confusing the government with a travel agency and using the state coffers as a business venture, like Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers are not supposed to argue in the government. Conflicts should be thrown out of it.
The material that comes into the cabinet must be ready. There is no room for coalition ruptures, power ballots and deals. Decisions must be made there.
How do you expect to have a cohesive team when the ministers mainly act on behalf of the party?
The constitutional law is above the parties.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said that the coalition agreement did not apply and turfed Babiš out of the government.
Any prime minister can do that.
But if they have character and leadership skills then these kinds of gestures are not needed.
They measure everyone equally and demand perfect execution from one and all.
Do you already know who you would appoint as the Minister of Finance?
I'm not thinking about it at all. We will probably will not end up in government. Nobody wants to cooperate with us, even though I do not know what I've done that's so terrible.
So much skepticism is out of place.
The mayors (STAN) enlisted businessman Dědek, who would like to cooperate with you. The KDU-ČSL may beat your winger Jiří Čunek.
I don't think so.
ČSSD is led by Lubomir Zaoralek, who is not ruling out a coalition with ANO, and Václav Klaus might win out in the ODS, and he also isn't against it.
I would leave it to the voters.
Deputy Prime Minister and ANO Deputy Chairman Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with Tomio Okamura's SPD, such as in terms of the economy, for example.
So, Okamura supporters are being considered as coalition partners?
Mr. Brabec claims that he did not say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history. He stood as Vít Bárta's puppet for the VV, then he earned money for his firm from Úsvit. Some kind of coup took place.
He is, of course, a strong personality.
But he is browned, somehow.
Looking at his plan, it involves the widespread engagement of people in the management of society, i.e. direct democracy, which we can agree on.
That's not what I'm asking you about at all.
I'm interested in whether it is acceptable for you to work with someone who has xenophobic views, talks about the gallows at demonstrations and wants to leave the EU?
We will not consider cooperating with Mr Okamura's party, I can not imagine it.
He clearly went into politics for the sake of profit.
And what about having the silent support of the Communists for your minority government?
I cannot imagine it, but the voters will decide.
The winner will negotiate with the person who comes second, but God knows who will be the winner and who number two.
Of course, it is important for them to able to agree on a coalition government programme.
Let's go back to your attempt to run the state as a business.
The government simply needs to be led. Prime Minister Sobotka left everything to rot, he never made any decisions.
Coalition issues like CEB or EGAP did not work.
Anyway, Sobotka is his puppet, and I think that was also why he threw me out.
As soon as he did, ČEZ controlled the Czech government.
It's unbelievable that the Prime Minister would send a decree written by ČEZ's management stipulating how the Minister of Finance should vote at the ČEZ General Meeting.
If you become prime minister, will you change the proportions of personnel in the supervisory board and will you change the top management of ČEZ?
Jesus Christ, if I become prime minister then we'll see.
I'm not there yet.
Rumour has it that ČEZ has already been sending you signals.
They would like to exchange the hood cooperation with the ČSSD for an even better one with ANO.
So maybe after the elections, everything will go ahead.
I don't know anything about that.
I have no Pokorný or Růžička style lobbyist. I am a separate entity and I do not deal with this at all.
So answer directly.
If you become the head of government, will you go after the leadership of ČEZ, České televize (Czech Television) or Všeobecné zdravotní pojišťovny, which are the institutions that you criticise?
I would like ČEZ to be a transparent company.
Meanwhile, he has been doing what he wants for years, thanks to kickbacks for traditional political parties.
Just look at Mr Schwarzenberg's statements.
Even though the state has a majority in ČEZ, it never directed it. It just served as a makeweight, which is wrong.
It's a trivial matter, in my opinion.
ČEZ should take Dukovany, value it, stick it into a subsidiary, arrange financing, hold a tender for the supplies or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The idea that the state should finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
And Česká televize?
Some of its shows have a permanent campaign against me, but I do not have and will not have any authority to get rid of it.
But you could control it.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay about 7.2 billion a year for public radio and television fees, but they do not really know how these institutions are run.
How is it possible that they don't know?
The Chamber of Deputies approves a report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of the ČT and ČRo (Czech Radio) general managers.
Look at how the news handled the Sobotka-Kalousek super-pact, which always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary commission on leaks from investigation files and Lex Babiš.
Sobotka was stupid enough to let himself be pushed around by Kalousek, who made him throw me out of government, which won percentage points for TOP 09 percent, but ČSSD took them away.
They are afraid of an interference to their corrupt system, and so they talk about the threat to democracy posed by Babiš.
Nobody is immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how, as the first deputy chairman of ANO, Jaroslav Faltýnek is building a powerhouse by placing his son in the Supervisory Board of Tepláren Brno and arranging contracts with municipal and state-owned companies like Pražský dopravní podnik (Prague Transport Company) and České dráhy (Czech Railways) through the lawyer Květoslav Hlína?
We have a long-term dispute over it.
I don't like it, and I've reproached him for it several times.
Faltýnek argues that the aforementioned lawyer works at considerably lower rates and is reliable.
I would not take it so far.
I didn't have anyone as Minister of Finance.
Unlike the Social Democrats, we have never had any corruption scandals, no Pelts, no Kratochvílová, no Březinas.
As soon as there was any hint of clientelism in our party, we threw out threw the people involved out right away.
I'm not willing to compromise in that regard.
If anything like that were to happen, we would get rid of the relevant people, no matter who they were.
