The president of DFB Grindel sees no basis for the returning of Özil
Berlin - The president of DFB Reinhard Grindel sees no basis for the returning of Mesut Özil to the national team.
There is an open question so you get into a conversation, you talk to him about why you have apparently felt that way, how is stated in his statement, said Grindel in football Podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the newspaper "Bild-Zeitung".
In spite of the debate going on for months about the photos of Özil with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the return of the 92-match national player Özil.
I would be happy if Mesut Özil continued to play for Germany.
At some point of time I also assumed that it will happen, said Grindel.
The 29-year-old had declared that he quits DFB team in July and explained it with the fact that Grindel did not protect him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB head repeated his criticism of Özil and that he is not ready for a discussion with national coach and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to create any pressure, but he knows that in football ‘if you leave a team or change club, you talk to your trainer and I think it is sad that this discussion did not happen before’.

Linz: Garden shed in allotment gardens burnt down
At 14.13 the Linz professional fire department was notified of a fire in Angererhofweg.
As a high-voltage power line directly traverses the allotment garden, danger was imminent.
The professional fire brigade drove out and on arrival found the hut fully in flames.
The roof had to be almost completely removed and the huge amount of debris needed clearing.
The owner of the burning garden hut stated that at noon he had connected a battery to the power supply for charging.
This was the possible cause of the fire.
According to the fire department the loading unit was in the most intensive area of the fire.
The damage caused by the fire, and the cause of the fire, still needs to be investigated.
The damage could be considerable as the owner stored many collectibles in his garden hut.

Angry mother defends herself: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the street
What provoked Lindsay Lohan to such very strange actions?
She apparently wanted to lure the children away from the alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, ‘Herbie: Fully Loaded’) has live streamed how she openly wanted to tear children away from a family in Moscow.
This was reported by US portal "TMZ" with publication of a partial recording of the stream.
Here you can see the "Just My Luck" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip you can see how Lohan gets out of a car and goes up to a possibly homeless family, identified as a refugee family from Syria.
As the family flee in front of the actress, Lohan follows the parents and their children.
She accuses the adults of child trafficking.
Yet she does not offer any proof in the clip.
The whole world is watching, says Lohan in the video as she follows the family further down the street.
She seems to try to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, it seems that the obviously angry mother had it enough.
It looks as if they turn around and Lohan gets a slap in the face.
In tears, the actress protests about how shocked she is - holding her cheek.
What provoked Lindsay Lohan to such very strange actions is currently completely unclear.

Audi: "Dieselgate" regeneration takes longer than planned
There is still a diesel taskforce, said Peter Mertens, chief development officer from the ‘Automobilwoche’ trade journal.
In December 2017 the imprisoned and suspended Audi CEO Rupert Stadler had announced, the taskforce will be dissolved soon.
In the first quarter of 2018 all engine/transmission combinations will have been checked, he said at the time.
Mertens now says: ‘At the start of July we have an important milestone by which the diesel crisis will have been worked out.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The taskforce was set up in September 2015 following the discovery at Audi parent company Volkswagen.
Mertens highlighted that the automobile manufacturers had made ‘serious, organizational changes’, to prevent such a scandal ever happening again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and will continue this discussion on Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi boss, following awareness of exhaust emission cheating, of permitting the sale of diesel automobiles with false emission values.
He must have known about the tampering or deliberately ignored it.
Currently the Sales Director Bram Schot heads the company as Acting Chief Executive Officer.
After conversion to the new emissions and consumption standard WLTP, there were production losses at Audi, Schot told the ‘Heilbronner Stimme’.
Essentially, he sees a falling demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, produced in Neckarsulm.
The segment in itself is a difficult one, he said.
Schot is for electromobility.
There are already 15,000 reservations for the e-tron, the first Audi electric automobile.

Grindel seeking re-election - Lahm to join the Presidential Board of the German football association (DFB)
Mainz (dpa) - Despite the criticism directed at him personally following the early FIFA World Cup exit and the scandal around Mesut Özil, Reinhard Grindel wants to run for office as President of the DFB again in the coming year.
I do my work and try to make it as good as it gets, said Grindel as a guest early Sunday morning on ZDF’s weekly sports broadcast "Das aktuelle Sportstudio".
A re-election should be attempted and that is what I will do.
And then you have to see what kind of support you get.
In his own words, the head of the association would find it "strange" if he did not "feel like working on the future project" after Germany was awarded the UEFA European Football Championship 2024.
Since April 2016, Grindel has been the head of the association as successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who had to resign amidst the scandals surrounding the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany.
In autumn 2016 he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will be held at the DFB’s national conference on September 27, 2019.
According to Grindel, the future head organizer of the 2024 European Football Championship in Germany, Philipp Lahm, is to join the DFB Presidential Board.
I would be pleased if my colleagues on the presidential board agreed that he will continue to provide advice on the board in this role and then of course we very much invite him to share his experience in sporting matters, said Grindel.
At the same time, he did not want to speculate as to whether or not Lahm could succeed him as head of the DFB.
As a consequence of the scandal over the photos taken by Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed a preference for a national team player without an immigration background to fill the position of DFB ambassador for integration.
Currently, this position is filled by native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who traces her family back to Cameroon.
If somebody without a migration background is an obvious influencer in society and football and says, ‘the issue is an important one, we need to do something about it’, ‘this would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our local teams, where integration needs to work’, Grindel said.

Losing weight the right way with semi-smart scales
I have owned a new toy for four weeks now.
Scales that weigh my body fat percentage as well as my weight.
Even muscle and bone mass can be displayed.
This thing also calculates my body mass index but that is rather useless anyway.
After all, it does not tell me whether I have been replacing fat with muscle.

Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
During his three-day state visit, Erdoğan met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite adherents of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens wherever they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to unsettle our citizens and damage the German/Turkish friendship’, he said.
Inner city Cologne was partially blocked for the opening of the Ditib mosque.
Many thousands of police were deployed, including snipers.
The Ditib Islamic association is under criticism because it is seen as an extended arm of the Turkish government.

Global Citizen Festival: Music against poverty: Stars, boos and scary moments
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B campaigned for more engagement in the fight against poverty and illness at a collective concert in New York’s Central Park.
Get involved wherever you can, said Mendes on Sunday evening at the festival in front of approximately 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming, this is a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with tassels and a gold microphone.
I am nervous, I am sweating, but it’s OK because I’m here and ready to change the world.
Even actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, government representatives, the United Nations and aid organizations appeared on the stage at the spectacle, which lasted for hours.
There was a scary moment when many spectators mistook the noise of a falling metal barrier for shots, got scared and tried to run away.
There was a short panic with people running in all directions.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed the audience from the stage.
Nobody is trying to injure anyone, said Martin.
You are all safe.
As every year, tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge online.
If you wanted to get one, you had to read and share texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and diseases online.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were cheers and applause from the audience - by contrast, Republican Senator Jeff Flake was booed.
Flake did join his Democratic colleague Chris Coons on the stage in calling for more equal rights between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken in the Judiciary Committee of the US Senate supporting the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge on the Supreme Court, which offended many women.
At least three women made abuse allegations, including some of attempted rape against Kavanaugh, who rejects these.
Flake called for an FBI investigation after two women who reportedly experienced sexual assault themselves confronted him on the way to a committee meeting in an elevator.
You are welcome to join me in an elevator anytime, Flake said to the crowd at the New York concert.

Freedom of Press: Federal government defends exclusion of journalist
Government spokesperson Steffen Seibert has defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had put on a T-shirt with the Turkish and German writing “Freedom for journalists” and was sitting in the first row.
The T-shirt was not the problem, Seibert said to the Bild on Sunday.
It was about a disruption in the course of the press conference.
The journalist’s action created a lot of unrest, which was unacceptable.
Thus, he ordered bodyguards to escort the man out.
Seibert said that it was not permitted to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the federal chancellery.
no matter if it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are imprisoned.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or supporting or being members of prohibited parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish government holds the movement responsible for the failed attempted coup on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are facing several decades in jail.
Even foreign journalists are not safe from Turkish authorities: At the beginning of September, the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Most recently, the cases of the incarcerated journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
They were released and were able to return to Germany, but the legal processes in Turkey against the two are still ongoing.

Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans normally know him to be so fresh and good looking: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice, though: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and he had a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show “Inas Nacht” [Ina's Night] produced by NDR is known for its cheery conversations at the bar of the Hamburg port pub “Schellfischposten.”
Moderator Ina Müller often cheers her guests with a beer, some wine or even stronger beverages to loosen up the mood and their tongues.
Quite a few celebs also need the liquid courage for the obligatory vocal number.
Another episode of the popular talk show was recorded on Friday.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known from films like "Männerherzen", "Terror - Ihr Urteil" or "Der geilste Tag".
The trip didn’t do the actor any good, though.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie - his face completely crumpled, only two small slits for eyes.
The bed selfie showed a completely drained Florian David Fitz.
But he is not ill, he only has quite a hangover.
Addressing his fans, he posted some - probably not entirely serious - insights he learnt: "Rule one: NEVER go to Inas Night.
Rule two: Never drink "die schwarze Sau".
And Spritz.
And also pass on Ina’s round of eggnog at half past two."
The long night is really showing on the 43-year-olds’ face.
His fans posted a couple of tips for getting rid of a hangover.
They ranged from instant broth, fish sandwiches or - probably the most effective - painkillers.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive movie star.
We still don't know how Ina Müller survived the binge drinking at night.
Since she has hosted the wild TV fun at the bar since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much better prepared...
Out for a beer with Ina Müller.

Ethnological Museum Returns Objects to Alaska Natives
The Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation (SPK) is going to return nine objects from the collection of the Ethnological Museum of the National Museums in Berlin to the Chugach Alaska Corporation.
The Foundation Board approved a proposal to this effect from the President today.
The items concerned are grave goods of indigenous peoples from south-western Alaska.
They were among the objects brought to Berlin by Johan Adrian Jacobsen, who traveled along the American northwest coast and in Alaska between 1882 and 1884 on behalf of the Royal Museum of Ethnology, which was the forerunner of the Ethnological Museum.
Hermann Parzinger, the SPK's President, stated:
“At the time, these objects were taken without the consent of the Alaska Natives and were therefore removed unlawfully from the graves of their deceased, so they do not belong in our museums.”
“We will now be returning them to the Chugach Alaska Corporation, with whom we have been working to re-examine our collection since 2015.”
The objects restituted today will be presented in the Chugach Community in the future, not least in the annual Chugach Spirit Camp, which is designed to raise awareness of the origin and history of the people in the Prince William Sound and to heighten awareness of their history and culture.
In the course of John Johnson’s current stay in Berlin, a Memorandum of Understanding with the Ethnological Museum has been drafted.
The objects are grave goods from Chenega Island and a place named as Sanradna in Kachemak Bay, whose precise location is no longer known.
Among them are two broken masks and a child’s cradle, as well as a wooden idol.
Masks were usually burned after use or laid in graves, which is why not many masks of the Chugach people exist today.
The red color on these ones indicates a funereal context.
The wooden idol is probably a shamanic figure, meant to protect people from danger and death.
Altogether, the Ethnological Museum of the National Museums in Berlin has about 200 Chugach objects in its collections.
The Chugach region of Southwestern Alaska has been inhabited for thousands of years by people who refer to themselves as Sugpiaq or Alutiiq, formerly known as Pacific Eskimos.
About 1,000 to 1,500 years ago, athabaskic-speaking groups of Indians immigrated, today's Dena'ina (formerly known as Tanaina).
Today, the Alaskan Natives, who call themselves Chugach, live around the Prince William Sound and Cook Inlet.
They live in seven communities: Chenega, Eyak, Nanwalek, Port Graham, Seward, Tatilek and Valdez.
Regular contacts with Europe existed since the time of Tsar Peter the Great.
In November 2015, a delegation from the Chugach Alaska Corporation visited the Ethnological Museum with the aim of initiating cooperation on future projects.
One of the reasons for this was their interest in creating a virtual presentation of all the Chugach objects around the world.
Following the visit, the Corporation asked the Ethnological Museum for assistance in repatriating any grave goods that had come from the region.
The Chugach Alaska Corporation (www.chugach-ak.com), created in 1972, is an organization representing the interests of the indigenous peoples of the Chugach region of Alaska.
Among other activities, it works to preserve the cultural heritage of these groups.
The US federal government presented a diplomatic note in support of the request for return.
The SPK diligently investigated the original context of the grave goods identified in the Ethnological Museum, doing so in accordance with its general policy on dealing with its non-European collections and on research into their provenance.
In the present case, all the indications are that the objects were obtained through grave robbery and not by an approved archaeological excavation.
From Adrian Jacobsen's travel journals, it is clear that the graves were opened solely for the purpose of removing their contents.
There were no government or local authority permits to do so, nor was there any documentation to show that consent had been granted by the community of origin.
In view of these facts, it was decided to return the objects.
Johan Adrian Jacobsen traveled along the American northwest coast and in Alaska at the end of the nineteenth century for the Royal Museum of Ethnology in Berlin.
The director of the museum at the time, Adolf Bastian, had commissioned him to collect objects that were as “original” as possible, untainted by European culture, with the aim of building up a collection.
Jacobsen returned to Berlin with around three thousand objects from the northwest coast and around four thousand objects from Alaska.
His account of the journey is an impressive historical document.
It is characterized, however, less by accurate ethnographic observations than by tales of derring-do, told by a hard-nosed adventurer.
With this in mind, the travels of the self-proclaimed “captain” will also be at the center of an exhibition module in the Humboldt Forum, serving as a critical examination of the history of the collection from today's perspective.

Treysa has struggled against vandalism and garbage
Accessing the 36-kilometer cycle track in Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is very difficult and heavily littered.
Attempts are made to remedy the rampant vandalism, but there are hardly any signs of solutions.
Shards, cigarette butts, garbage and rubbish, demolished rubbish bins and now dismantled signs - so for quite some time presents itself the entrance with seating area to the bike path on the Haaße-hill in Treysa.
The sight of the bicycle path, which is the flagship object in Rotkäpchenland, is more than inglorious.
The matter is of concern to the ADFC (German Cyclists Association) chapter Schwalmstadt, but others have also taken interest for some time, according to the city's cycling commissioner Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been addressed by the bicycle traffic advisory body.
There is no solution so far.
Suggestions ranged from transferring the seating area to the regular emptying of garbage cans, and cleaning the point of entry areas.
I think, the latter would be the order of the day, irrespective of any further activities, says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) says he also brought the issue up with the local advisory council.
Not only the rubbish is a nuisance for cyclists and residents - on weekends the seating group is a regular meeting place for partying.
It is not just about the noise, there are also disturbances due to parties: Posts pulled out of the ground, garbage cans wrecked, signs snapped and seating daubed.
Frequently volunteers have already cleaned up, explains the ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
Actions are only proverbial drops in the ocean.
They are annoyed that the rest area at the cycle track in Treysa is a meeting point for binge-drinking.
Clearly the focus point along the entire bike path is here on the Haaße, confirms the cycling commissioner, who now is also responsible for the cycling site in Ziegenhain, which will be opened today.
If it suffers the same fate, it will cost dearly.
Another idea is placing video surveillance on the hill: "Possibly this raises the threshold to engage in damaging common property.
However, this would require a police patrol to come out.
In principle, Wüstenhagen supports the development of the Haaße hill.
It needs to be made more attractive.
So far one can be very satisfied with how well the bicycle path is frequented.
It is still possible to develop tourism-related marketing.
Our cycle track is of very high quality compared to others in German’, agreed the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in the Ascheröder Strasse in Treysa to be critically dangerous.
There is no turning lane on Haaße Hügel.
In heavy traffic, cyclists may end up waiting in the middle of bidirectional traffic flows", she explains.
That would not be a problem for sporty cyclists, but is for older people and especially for children.

Music contest at the culture train station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the sea
The first call to participate in the music contest was a success, creative and cooperative.
Your Song for Hiltrup is the motto of the Hiltrup initiative for the "Music Contest for young and old, new and experienced musicians."
A contest "with a wink from the lovely Hiltrup family", as Karl Franke worded it.
In fact, it soon became a familial togetherness with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven acts performed, from a one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with his guitar, Rolf Ihmig, an old-established Hiltrup man, the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members from three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling und die Zwarties.
This contest is a novelty, explains district mayor Joachim Schmidt.
We have not seen something like this in other districts.
What did the songwriters sing about?
Particularly popular places were the Hiltrup lake and Marktallee.
Rolf Ihmig dedicated the song to the avenue Marktalle in his folk-like song "Kö von Hiltrup".
The Kulturbahnhof was also mentioned.
Over and over again, the acts sang about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke led the audience through the breaks with short interviews with the performers or some information about the artists.
Thus, the audience learnt that Humberg that he had actually studied chemistry, but now also teaches guitar.
From the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann Franke reported that he had recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest as a main act.
And Alvin Jasic has uploaded a lot of YouTube videos.
It’s not about winning, Franke had said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from Hiltrup catering businesses.
For the jury's favorites there was something special - so that others could also hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record an entire CD with sound technician Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup hit, which especially impressed Franke with his musicality, and the “Lummerland pack:” “a very good performance” with ten children and two teachers on guitar and cajón, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children also performed again for the finals - and even without electronic support, they sounded "really good," Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Trade Association as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year anniversary.
They considered the event a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied," and "the atmosphere was good" in the very crowded Kulturbahnhof.

The Word Game: Testing "Decrypto"
The players form two teams and sit opposite one another.
For each page there is a screen, on it there are four cards with keywords that you can decipher - the old trick with the red foil.
This ensures the other side cannot read anything unintentionally.
For example, on the cards it says to read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2. Fenster.
3. Cube.
4. Solidʺ.
These are the terms that need to be coded.
So the terms are not guessed, the codes are.
Taking turns, one player per team is the encryptor.
They get a code card that has "3.4.2." etc. written on it.
In "Decrypto," it is not the words behind the secret film that should be guessed, but their encryption codes.
The task in this case: They should - in this order and in this example - describe the terms "cube", "solid" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not, because the team that cracks the code twice wins the game.
The encryptor writes down and reads aloud: "Throw" for the dice, "loose" as opposed to "solid". Of course, something like "evidence" would be possible or "Prague" because he read some history books and knows about the defenestration of Prague.
This then progresses, round for round, team by team.
It is true that one does not know the terms of the other side - but with every clue the encryptor gives, you’re closer to finding them out.
So the term should be as mysterious as possible, but not too crazy. Otherwise, you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic ‘Decrypto’ is the precept unfortunately.
The players have to study it for quite a long time and in detail, until they can finally play it.
The explanatory video under decrypto.info on the web will make it easier.
But once you have started, you’ll be amazed at how much emotion there is in this nondescript game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as its predecessor and genre-primus "Codenames", which also makes use of the spy theme for a game with few words, but it’s much easier to play in small groups.
And if it's all about guessing and not about winning, it's easy to play a version for two.

Kulmbach: Man gives police the Hitler salute and harasses guests in the pub
During the night from Saturday to Sunday a 48 year old man gave the police station in Kulmbach twice something to do.
First he showed the Hitler salute to a passing police patrol in the upper town, later he was also found in the upper town in a pub where he harassed other guests.
After clearly under the influence of alcohol he did not comply with the police order to vacate the premises, he had to spend the night in the detention cell in the police station of Kulmbach.
In the sober state, he also had to take legal responsibility for the use of symbols of unconstitutional organisations.

The Pressig depotwas home to the thrust locomotives
For decades the depot in Pressig was the hub of the Franconian Forest.
1991 put an end to a piece of railway history.
The crashing from bumper to bumper could be heard throughout Pressig, remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the stations.
This did not bother anybody.
The squeaking of brakes and rattling of carriages could also be heard.
This was pure railway.
Statements that are symbolic for Dinkel’s Pressig homeland.
Nowhere in the Franconian forest has a place been characterized by the railway so much.
This was the starting point for the steep mountain section to the north, which peaks in Steinbach am Wald following an ascension of about 220 meters.
Previously trains and locomotives housed in Pressig were needed to handle this.
In 1901 the Bavarian parliament approved the building of a depot with 21 locomotives, apprentice workshops, catenary and railroad maintenance division.
The centerpiece was the turntable, which after reconstruction in the year 1899 had a diameter of 18 metres, says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a railway historian and a professional railroader with 47 years of experience.
The Pressig depot, which in the year 1968 was relocated to Bamberg, also operated locomotives for the branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15 1950 the "Volksblatt" reported of a staff of 160 men; 13 steam locomotives and eight electric locomotives were stationed in Pressig at that time.
The electrification of the track in 1939 reduced the need for pulling trains and locomotives.
From 1977 they were still used with freight trains.
By 1991 at least 10,000 wagons were shunted.
In 1982 the depot was partially dismantled and the remainder in the year 1991.
Heidrich: ‘It’s a shame that better use of the location is not envisaged, also with regard to freight traffic’.
Still in the year 1989 at Pentecost, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld" with a pompous station festival for the anniversary in Pressig.
10,000 enthusiastic spectators were here, remembers Georg Dinkel.
Shortly afterwards.
On June 1, 1991 the last 30 men were withdrawn and the Pressig marshalling yard was history.
The shunters and wheel scotches took care of the heaviest rail traffic work, remembers Dinkel.
Each mistake could have fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen station led to a change in the hierarchy of both locations and how many more historical and current pictures there are, is included here in the infrankenPlus article.

Kerber with initial success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round in the tennis tournament in Beijing, just as Julia Görges before.
Kerber won 6:2 at the China Open against Frenchwoman Kristina Mladenovic.
Next opponent of the world ranking third is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or Carla Suárez Navarro from Spain.

On the weekend as part of the "Art and Enjoyment" series, a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach.
Organisers and visitors showed great relief that the weather conditions were ideal for the special vernissage of the "Windspiel-Performance" which took place in the open air on the Dahlmann-Schmidt property in Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourism association "Rund ums Walberla" (Around Walberla) in the framework of the series "Art and Enjoyment".
This opened its doors for the 15th year.
The large number of visitors showed the fascination with the exhibits.
21 exhibits from 20 artists can now be viewed in Mittelehrenbach.
The host Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists at the opening of the exhibition.
He had been there from the first hour.
As has Volker Hahn, who has made a name for himself as the main organiser as well as an artist.
It was a little surprising when Hahn announced his retirement some days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer he put his task in experienced, young hands with excellent future prospects.
In the past, both have already been actively involved in the selection of artists and have helped in designing flyers.
Once again this year there will be a 70 cent special stamp designed on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss (art and enjoyment), available at every art station.
The poster this year ‘outdance the Betzn’, designed by Volker Hahn, can be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn enjoyed the excellent reception of the special exhibit.
It was possible to persuade Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg to provide musical framing.
The visitor quickly understands when walking through the spacious garden that the title "Windspiel-Performance" literally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it in a playful way.
There are metal or ceramic works of art, often accented with color.
Already at the entrance to the property, on the right side, the visitor is awaited by the "Glücksbaum" (luck tree) by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, brightened with color, equipped with 20 pin wheels, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminum tubes for a sound piece.
The sun shining through the bushes in the background adds a magical touch to the object, inviting visitors to linger.
Barbara Waschneck comes from Eckental and prefers to dedicate three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts moving in the wind.
Halfway through the path Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "Der Wind das himmlische Kind" (The Wind the Heavenly Child).
At the end, Volker Hahn demonstrates his colorful fantasy created from clay, cement and stainless steel.
The ‘wind chime performance’ theme wanders through the multi-purpose art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be viewed until December 31, 2018.

50 years of MGV 68 Albachten: Singers celebrate 50th birthday
1968 - That was the time of the protest and the student movement.
And also the people of Albachten demonstrated their anger.
At least five of them.
In no case did they want to accept that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there would be no more singing life in the district.
It has become a legend by now: At a bank in Tinnenbusch, the MGV 68 came to existence.
That was 50 years ago.
Now there will be a big anniversary celebration in the “House of Encounter.”
It will be full today, senses chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he was right.
There are 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singer.
They had revived the foundation festival especially for the anniversary.
It was a tradition for years, and then there was a break for the first time.
The traditional festival was back again in time for the 50th anniversary.
It became an elegant ball and formal clothing had been requested beforehand.
Guests did not sit in rows as usual in the “House of Encounter,” but rather sat comfortably around tables.
In between, everyone could dance. DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln put on the controls and heated up the dance floor.
Of course, the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten would let their voices sound.
Matching the occasion, happy songs were quite fitting.
Almost set: "So ein Tag, so wunderschön wie heute."
There was also the “Rüdesheim wine” to go with the exquisite grape juice, which many guests had in front of them.
“Humulus lupulus,” which is the Latin name for ‘hops,’ references another cool drink.
The choir direction of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in Tinnenbusch back then, was once again very confident.
It's just fun to sing under his direction, said Holstiege. "He has such an easy way, he accomplishes a masterpiece every time.". By the way, this time not only men were presented vocally.
The ladies’ choir “High C” were also guests, whose repertoire above all includes evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
To round it all off there was some poetry.
Singer Theo Weber sat at his desk until three in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented melodic poetry.
There was also a big Tombola game.
The proceeds are to go towards financing the children of the Albatros Youth Center visiting the all-weather zoo.

Volleyball: Women's 3rd League: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The promoted team marches on.
Three games, three wins - USC Münster's reserves, under the patronage of Axel Büring, gets on really well in league three.
No trace of shyness or getting the heebie-jeebies. The independents are doing their thing.
And with the 3-0 (25-15, 25-23, 26-24) against city rivals BW Aasee, they did really well.
It wasn't crystal clear, but we have already left an impression, says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed with him: “This is a defeat that we can live with.
We are not dissatisfied.” Quite the contrary.
In the evening, at Ronja de Boer’s belated birthday party, the mood was good, the game was done.
Yes, the result is in fact an optical illusion.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
If you bring it to the finish, such a game can also tip over quite easily, Büring knows from years of experience.
Ultimately USC made everything clear with its experienced players and finished it out.
We all know who is on the other side in such a derby.
That was not our undoing.
I've seen a great game of volleyball at times, Annacker did not struggle with the 0-3 and went straight back to the agenda.
After just three matchdays, it does not seem foreseeable where the independents’ journey goes.
It’s simply too early for that, says Axel Büring.
He only feels vindicated in one thing: “The 3rd Women's League has an unbelievably good level of play.
It’s not even close with regional league volleyball.” They don't even want to look down towards the fourth league.
If they don’t want to lose hope, they have to look up.
But a conclusion can't be drawn until after ten or eleven games.
The next game is at Emlichheim on Saturday.
Aasee will compete in Essen on October 14.

Glider crashes - student pilot crashed fatally
The pilot of a glider that crashed in Essen died.
On Sunday afternoon, the single-seated aircraft crashed during landing in a parking lot near the airport Essen-Mülheim, said a police spokesman on Sunday in Essen.
The parking lot next to the 52 highway that is normally used for shuttle transport to the conference, was relatively empty, other people were not injured in the crash.
Emergency counselors took care of other student pilots and eyewitnesses on site.
In the immediate vicinity there was the venue of an Oktoberfest, in the evening many guests were expected to be there.
The cause of the crash was not clear - the weather was good, there was a slight wind and sunshine.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller did not feel she was enough for her husband
The "Dream Ship" made Heide Keller a star.
Now she speaks openly that the series could have had some influence on her divorce with Hans von Borsody.
Heide Keller (76) became famous in her role as chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the ‘Dream Boat’, but on 01 January 2018 she disembarked forever.
The series that made her a star might be one of the reasons of her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), to whom she had been married for ten years.
This could also have been a reason.
Because this work became a part of me, I traveled around the world with a suitcase alone and many of my admired colleagues treated me as equal, explained Keller in the interview to "Bild am Sonntag".
She used to be "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that had changed with the "Dream Ship".
Because now journalists called her only as Heide Keller.
I don’t know if he was happy with this.
She thinks that it possible that her husband might have been jealous at the time, but "as many men Hans was afraid of talking about problems and feelings."
Keller always made effort for Hans von Borsody "and he did not want to discover my fears and my weaknesses.
In plain language it means: I’m pretending," as she explains further.
She always had the feeling of ‘not being enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, which actually I never was, even though I sometimes appeared cheeky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to last forever’.
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said ‘Yes’ again, ‘although I was scared it could go wrong again’.
The day before the civil marriage, I sat in the changing room crying and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to von Borsody failed as well.
Why did it never work out with men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller was in love at that time "as in the movie.
Unfortunately, this vision is not compatible with daily life.
I am too naive to approach love."

The moth, who regularly explores the city nightlife in the NZZ Zurich area, has now attempted this on the ZFF opening party.
Not really a moth, just a little shady.
And the shiny glare, in which a green carpet is bathed in, on the Sechseläutenplatz, blinds him over the charge.
It is the film festival though, where the more or less famous want to bathe in the spotlight.
So this late Thursday evening he tottered across the square, to briefly relieve himself in the "Aquaclean toilet oasis".
This is the name of the public toilet complex sponsored by a large sanitary company, which is being premiered at the festival: The public convenience on the ground floor of a new pavilion tries hard to create a luxurious ambience.
This evening, whatever the reason, it literally stinks in the gents area.
So out of here, over to the other side of the street: Invited guests, who were entertained at the best level at the cinema next door with the opening film "Green Book", like every year celebrate the opening of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: It is well known that the works shown originate from the whole globe.
What do you have to come up with when writing an article about this festival, so as not to fall into hidden advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The moth binds a ribbon around the feelers that a fairy godmother has sent him, and two beefy doormen generously let him pass inside.
Inside, the invited are crowded together, they dance way past midnight to live music or accept rhythms dictated by the DJ, to which they shout at each other, and rinse exquisite appetizers down with a glass of champagne.
In the delicatessen in the basement oysters await slurping mouths, nearby the unparalleled Culatello di Zibello raw ham is freshly cut, and a chocolate fountain bubbles.
And the highlight is: that the shop shelves have not been cleared of the exclusive products for the event.
It has been like this for years and seems to function without any major losses.
You must just love the country for it!
The moth studies the sign by the escalator: "Please be careful on the escalator if you are wearing a long dress".
Should this be two separate instructions, he has ignored the dress code.
However, it is a conditional construction that has undoubtedly saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the winged man tips down a cocktail made with espresso called "Golden Eye", which is suited to the festival award.
The mixture getting the prize for the best drink, presented by a capsule manufacturer - not compulsory.
And George Clooney, who has been advertising for the brand mentioned for years, is also not there on the evening.
There is one face, however, between local notables, cash desk and kitchenware, that is familiar to the spectators: Peter Farrelly, Director of the opening film.
Its main character will not be far away.
And in reality: Immediately, Viggo Mortensen, who is almost sixty walks through the crowd appearing almost like a choir boy.
He is not talked into, not gaped at, at the most he receives stealthy glances.
This restraint, easily mistaken for inhibition, is why the international stars love this film festival.

Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with a Cumbia dance
Trainer and ex-footballer, Diego Maradona is delighted at his team’s victory.
Argentina’s football legend, Diego Maradona has clearly settled well in his new homeland Mexico.
The 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the changing room to Cumbia rhythms after a 2:0 victory for his club Dorados de Sinaloa, as shown in a video already released on Saturday.
A team member’s 15-second clip shows Maradona dancing in a yellow strip, cheered on by the players.
The Mexican second league team defeated Leones Negros 2:0.
After the game Maradona said to a TV camera ‘Time after time with my boys’.
Since the beginning of September the 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club.

Handball: Association League 1: ASV Senden "devastated" after last-minute loss
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball club ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat.” His protégés were “devastated” after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) failure - the fourth in four games - Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
Over long periods, they had - as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst - not played badly.
We only overslept the initial phase, said the ASV coach annoyed.
Quickly, the home team led with 8-1, also the early break, that Bieletzki had taken, did not pan out.
But then suddenly a jolt went through the team, summarized Bieletzki.
At halftime, they were only two goals behind.
Senden's best player, Marius Hintze, kept scoring in phase one.
After the change, things got even better from the visitors’ point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst equalized for 15-15.
Four minutes before the alarm, the lead was still only three goals (29-26).
And then?
The impartial got in on the action.
Bieletzki usually does not seek blame with others.
But: The 120-second time penalty caused by Steffen Mühlhoff “was a joke.”
LIT had an opportunity and scored four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, defended well and repeatedly threw the ball on the empty goal.
But compliments don’t win games.
Now it must be a damned victory, said Bieletzki.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).

Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - Police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of a (then) 18 year old Naila (district of Hof), police are searching for the remains of the woman.
Response services dug up a street on Saturday near Marxgrün.
For this purpose, the road surface and several layers were removed below, as police and prosecutors announced.
According to new findings, the missing woman may have been buried not far from her former home.
The woman disappeared on November 4, 1986.
Investigators at the time did not rule out foul play.
According to information, since last year the criminal investigation department of Hof has been working intensively on the case together with the public prosecution department.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, the investigators discovered a conspicuous feature under the road in Marxgrün by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials were able to limit the area to a few yaars.
The results of the excavations are to be announced this afternoon.

The hacking attack on millions of Facebook users shows the dangers that lurk online.
Users themselves can also take care of additional security.
Instead of complicated letter sequences, users should rather use passphrases to secure their online accounts.
In addition, security updates, such as those for Windows, should be quickly installed and there is no harm in equipping computers with anti-virus protection.

Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his threatened dismissal as the chief executive of the billion dollar company.
He and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) settled a lawsuit out of court regarding misleading Tweets in which Musk could have lost his ability to manage listed companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla are each paying 20 million US dollars. In addition, Musk is giving the office of chairman up for three years.
He may stay CEO, though.
In the settlement, which still has to be confirmed by a court, Musk nor Tesla admitted wrongdoing.
The SEC has sued the world-famous manager in the US federal court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads SpaceX, is the public face of the electric car pioneer currently posting losses, which is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk unaware of any wrongdoing
Musk explained that he did nothing wrong and is very sad and disappointed about the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the spirit of truth and transparency and with his investors in mind.
On August 7, Musk wrote to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he would maybe remove the company from the stock exchange and pay 420 US dollars per share. The financing was secured.
That would have valued Tesla at 72 billion dollars.
Musk later backpedaled: Tesla remains a listed company.
According to the agreement, Tesla now has to find external chairman, appoint two independent board members and also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communication.

Football: Sturridge saves Liverpool: Klopp team 1:1 against Chelsea FC

Following six wins at the start Liverpool went back two places.
Chelsea stays in third place, Manchester City is the new leader.
Eden Hazard in the 25th minutes with his sixth goal of the season secured the lead for Chelsea.
Thereafter, the Klopp team missed numerous opportunities for the tie.
National player Antonio Rüdiger cleared the line after a solo by Liverpool attacking player Mohamed Salah (31).
Shortly before closing Sturridge redeemed the Reds with a curler into the corner.
Record champion Manchester United is sliding deeper into crisis following the worst season start since 1989.
The team of the controversial coach José Mourinho earned a justified lost at West Ham United 1:3 (0:2) and remains with ten points after seven matchdays only in the middle of the table.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow ahead of the Champions League match against Valencia on Tuesday.
The former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno made his first Premier League appearance after Petr Cech was injured.
Before the Champions League game at 1899 Hoffenheim on Tuesday Manchester City won with goals from Raheem Sterling (29) and Sergio Agüero (65). 2:0 against Brighton & Hove Albion.
Leroy Sané prepared the 1:0, Ilkay Gündogan as a new attacking player was not used.

Survey: 46 percent do not want Merkel as Chancellor until 2021
After the quarrels of recent weeks, the grand coalition conceded several poll low blows.
A survey indicates that the SPD falls behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is reviewed critically.
Berlin - For the first time the AfD has overtaken the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the Bild am Sonntag nationwide.
In the weekly survey of the polling institute, the AfD has gained one point and holds 17 percent, the SPD, compared to the previous week, has lost a point and holds 16 percent.
Also CDU and CSU lose a point and hold only 27 percent.
So far this is the lowest rating for the Union in the Sunday trend.
The Greens achieve 15 percent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If on Sunday were the Bundestag election, the government parties SPD, CDU and CSU would only receive 43 percent of the votes according to Emnid.
The large coalition for all the large research institutes, with the exception of Allensbach, lost the majority in the ‘Sunday question’.
The government parties are coming up with 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 general election, together they received 53.4 percent.
The bandwidth is also great for the other parties: The AfD, in many polls holds the position of second strongest party, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens receive vote quotas of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The Left have an average of 10 percent, the FDP 9 percent.
Such surveys have an uncertainty of plus/minus 2 to 3 percent, according to statistical reasons, depending on the share of votes.
Since the 2017 general election however the backing for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has also fallen significantly in the population.
Currently only 48 percent of citizens believe Merkel is the right person in the Chancellery, as is revealed in the Emnid survey commissioned by BamS.
Only one in two (50 percent) in the survey want a grand coalition by the next regular parliamentary election in three years, 41 percent want a re-election.
Even in another survey published on Saturday clear losses in approval for Merkel were noted.
Divided was also the assessment of Germans concerning whether in December Merkel should again run for the CDU presidency.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favor, 44 percent against.
In the case of the unionists, 64 percent want a candidacy, 35 percent do not.

Poster at Aldi: Love at a discount
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Whoever says that there are no romantic "How we met"-stories anymore in times of Tinder, should head over to Aldi and talk about turkey meat.
Munich - In times of digital "fast-food dating" by Tinder and other dating apps, the supermarket exudes an almost anachronistic romance as a place to meet ‘the one’.
Yeah, right. If in doubt, talking about discounted turkey meat, boxer shorts at the rummage table, or your favorite pudding is still a better story for your future grandchildren than a mere right swipe.
The app Tinder has the reputation of being less of a place to meet, but rather more of lewd exchange.
We made the test: How do women react, if you do not beat around the bush in the first message?
Here is the amazing result.
There’s true Hollywood Lovestory potential with a lost-and-found plot.
If the guy then messages his inamorata with the e-mail address organic-turkeymeat@gmail.com, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and the like - Romantic Comedy at its best.
So, we wish the creator of this ad in an unknown Aldi branch that she will also find the man of her dreams, with whom she had talked briefly about the "Organic turkey meat, 30 percent off".
We should all believe in the magic of analogue acquaintance. This woman definitely earned her Hollywood happy ending.

Billerbeck: 500 caps for a life without polio
Since the start of the new school year the Ludgerischule has been involved in the action ‘Caps against Polio - 500 caps for a life without polio’.
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by the poliovirus.
The disease referred to in German as child paralysis (Kinderlähmung) causes paralysis and even death.
In Germany, polio is considered eradicated, but there are still three countries worldwide where the disease occurs.
A press release stated that to date the cause of poliomyelitis, the poliovirus, can only be contained by vaccination.

Soccer: Reus and Zorc demand rest for Götze
Leverkusen (AP) - BVB sporting director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public debate on Mario Götze’s shape and fitness.
We should stop worrying about Mario.
That does not do him any good.
And it also does not do us any good, said Reuss, Götze’s friend, after the 4-2 victory in Leverkusen in an interview with the TV channel Sky.
Zorc had already emphasized this before the game.
This is not an easy situation for him personally.

Football: Eberl: No rush for contract talks with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl from Bundesliga soccer team Borussia Mönchengladbach does not see any rush for a possible contract extension with trainer Dieter Hecking.
We have not even talked about a contract up to now.
There is no fixed date when we will do so.
There will certainly come a moment, when we sit down and talk, said Eberl on Sunday evening on the Sky TV channel.

Football: District League: Strong appearance of VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine gives hope
There were moments in this young season, when Alois Fetsch was really hard on his team.
Silently, the coach of the football district league club VfL Wolbeck first retreated (inwardly) to ponder over the lack of motivation on the playing field.
All is history.
Meanwhile, the game is on at Brandhoveweg.
The 1:1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine proved so, and they almost got promoted past season.
Yes, I am very happy with the appearance.
We made tightened spaces and put pressure on the ball.
That was something to be proud of, praised Fetsch his boys and went to each of his players individually after the game to simply say "thank you" for the great defense against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
Following Nico Frerich's injury (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly changed into a 4-2-3-1 in which Niklas Thewes was in the front line waiting for passes to him.
Wolbeck had much more time of possession in the first half.
And more opportunities
But Frerichs (17), substitute Luca Rehberg (26m) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
It almost backfired when SCA’s very own Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer made two dangerous attacks against Wolbecker in minute 41, but goalie Damian Hallas proved to be a master of his trade.
After halftime, VfL boldly took complete control.
Thewes just barely failed with a shot from 18 meters.
Schroer was too late in minute 58 when Thewes passed him the ball.
Fetsch decided to freshen up the team on the left wing and put in Miles Geske.
As Altenrheine's Chris Naberbäumer cut down Robin Westhues in minute 70, the home team got an indirect free kick 18 meters away from the goal.
The fouled player himself stepped up and demonstrated how dangerous he can be in set play situations.
Westhues kicked the ball with his strong right and the goalie had to face the fact that he had failed: 1:0 (minute 71).
With 20 minutes left on the clock, the game seemed to last forever.
Because then this happened: In minute 80, VfL captain Florian Quabeck accidentally touched the ball in the box.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider was not ready to miss this opportunity (minute 79).
Wolbeck had to endure long minutes in the final stage, when Geske finally managed to finally get that ball into the goal and secure the winning goal in minute 87.
That might have been overkill.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th minute Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th minute L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th minute Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt beats Hannover 96 4:1
Background: Four points after five match days - coach Adi Hütter was not going to be happy with that.
Eintracht Frankfurt wanted to take the first home victory at last against Hannover 96.
Striker Ante Rebic, who was in the starting line-up for the first time after an injury, was to help make it happen.
Midfielder Luca Torró was also back after a pubic bone injury and tasked to use his aerial prowess to prevent goals against Frankfurt from set pieces.
Interesting reading before the game: How Eintracht Frankfurt wants to climb further up, which sites Eintracht Frankfurt needs to close pretty soon - and how Allan Souza still wants to win through for Eintracht Frankfurt.
Review: Eintracht Frankfurt lose 1:3 to Borussia Mönchengladbach after a disappointing performance - the analysis from our sports reporters Ingo Durstewitz and Thomas Kilchenstein.

AllBright Foundation Report: Women continue to be a rarity on executive boards
Only 8 percent of board members were female as of September 1, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture," officially launched this Monday by the AllBright Foundation, an advance copy of which had been made available to the German Press Agency.
The companies will have to make changes, otherwise international competitors will leave them behind, said foundation CEO Wiebke Ankersen.
In the US, UK, or Sweden, male-only management teams have - with a few exceptions - been unthinkable for some time.
The gap makes the German competitors less diverse, innovative, and future-oriented by comparison.
It is a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the number of women in German listed companies can be specifically attributed to the positive boost from companies in the mid-cap index (MDax).
Yet according to Allbright data, only 6.8 percent of boards are female.
In the previous year the value was still at 3.8 percent.
Among the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women stagnated.
Most recently, there were 26 women working on the boards.
I am sure that Dax companies will be recruiting women more consistently in the coming year - it is in their own best interest, said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement showed no commitment to increase the “zero percent” to date.
The supervisory boards paint a different picture: As of September 1, the proportion of women was 30.5 percent - 45 more women and 68 fewer men than a year ago.
If multiple women were recruited to the boards every year, a percentage of 40 percent would be achieved in 2023, it says in the report.

Some are even suffering losses: Luxury cars: Which manufacturer gets the biggest profit from one car?
The biggest profit gets Ferrari.
With each sold Ferrari the Italians receive 280,000 euros and get 69,000 euros of business profit.
Big cars, big profits: In most cases this slogan is still true nowadays.
Who gets the biggest profit from one car among premium car dealers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers get for every car they sell?
On this issue have been working the "Autopapst" and Professor of Economics Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows: The difference is significant.
Within the first half of year Ferrari got 69,000 euros of business profit for each sold car, Jaguar Land Rover only comes to around 800 euros, whereas Tesla and Bentley do not put emphasis on their income from each car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are approaching with prices ranging from 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and about 3,000 euros Earnings Before Interest and Tax.

Torchlight procession to open the 60th Abtswind wine festival
With a torchlight parade, the tourism association of Abtswind opened its wine festival session.
For the 60th time the association organises the wine festivals which take place consecutively on every Saturday in October in the large festival tent on the Rehweiler road.
At the start of the jubilee the organisers, accompanied by the marching band from Wiesenbronn, moved through the town to the fairground.
The chairman of the tourist board, Wolfgang Starz, the mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess, Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests in the already jam-packed marquee. ‘60 years to set something like this up, is a titanic challenge for a small place with 800 inhabitants.
‘This is a proud achievement’, said Starz thanking all the helpers.
Later the wine princess Lisa II symbolically clinked glasses with the guests from the stage.
It is great that so many have found their way to us in Abtswind. Later, "Die Troglauer" created good mood.
On Sunday, on which the Abtswinder Kirchweih (parish fair) was celebrated, the association set the drink prices in the afternoon as they were 60 years to celebrate the anniversary.
A festive evening for the 60th Wine Festival takes place on Friday, October 5, in the house of the guests, before the next round, a day later in the festival tent.

In Bonn: Emergeny ambulance crashes into a taxi
An ambulance is heavily damaged next to a road.
A 27-year old passenger was fatally injured when the ambulance collided with a taxi.
When emergency responders are called, they are supposed to help - preferably even save lives.
Such a rescue trip in Bonn had a fatal end for a 26 year old.
Bonn - A 26 year old pedestrian was fatally injured when an ambulance collided with a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency responder and her driver were seriously injured, police stated.
The 46 year old driver of the ambulance ran a red light on Saturday afternoon with the blue lights flashing and siren sounding.
He then crashed into a taxi at a crossroads that drove at the green light.
The doctor's car flew against a traffic light mast and a tree after the collision.
He swept away the passerby who died at the scene.
The ambulance driver and the taxi driver are seriously injured
The 62 year old taxi driver and the driver of the ambulance were seriously injured and trapped in their vehicles and had to be freed by emergency services.
The 29-year-old emergency doctor, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but could no longer help the pedestrian.
Another emergency responder tried to do this, but without success.
The three seriously injured parties were taken to the hospital.

Manchester United loses again, Mourinho’s situation is becoming uncomfortable
After the embarassing exit from the League Cup Manchester United now receives a loss in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United ManU looses 1:3. The way of defeat certainly will remain a matter of discussion.
The scene in the 74th minute, when recovered Marko Arnautovic scored for West Ham 3:1, was symbolic; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford appeared to bring the Red Devils back into the game.
As the team suspected an offside in the pass by Mark Nobel, all of Manchester’s defensive players froze in position, giving Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
It was the negative climax of a very inadequate performance over long stretches.
The mood of United’s city rival, Manchester City is quite different.
The Citizens coached by Mourinho’s big rival Pep Guardiola scored against Brighton & Hove Albion for an unchallenged 2:0 win.
After half an hour Raheem Sterling made the first breakthrough, through the defense of the outsiders, for the home team.
After a good hour Sergio Agüero secured the way for the sixth win in seven game, through a double pass of the previous goal scorer, which sprung the team to the top of the table.
Liverpool is no longer table leader
Three days after losing 1:2 at the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought a 1:1 with Liverpool against Chelsea in the Premier League.
As at the Cup exit the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man for the London team.
The 27-year-old’s goal in the 25th minute was the only goal of match until the final phase.
Shaqiri, who replaced Mohamed Salah in the 66th minute only closely missed the tie goal after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge made it better in the 89th minute with his curl.
After the Reds started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea were unbeatable for the second time.
First, the London team eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, by the draw in the League, the Blues removed Liverpool now also from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London clubs celebrated 2:0 wins against Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford).
The fans of the Gunners, under whose eyes Granit Xhaka played, against the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire, however, had to wait until the 81st minute wait for a success message.
Nine minutes before the end of the game the Watford defender Craig Cathcart unleashed a cross-field ball past Alex Iwobi into one’s own net. Only two minutes later Mesut Özil scored his third goal of the season which was decisive.
Arsenal passed Watford thanks to its fifth successive win and are now fifth, just behind the great rivals Tottenham. Wolverhampton continues to leave a strong impression as a team climbing in position under the Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeaten for the fifth time in a row in the League with a 2:0 win over Southampton which places them in the eighth place.

VW core brand missing: Paris Motor Show marked by diesel debate
The Parisian automobile show takes place every two years in rotation with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue and yet immanent The diesel scandal and struggle for bans on driving and upgrading should not let German car companies take part in the industry meeting in Paris.
Next week they will be showing their new products at the 2018 Motor Show in the capital of French together with its competitors from all over the world.
The diesel does not really matter now.
The possible exchange and modernization offers for diesel engines owners in Germany, which are yet to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, should still be an important topic at least behind shiny exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen group is there with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the VW core brand itself.
Here are presented Audi and Mercedes-Benz, including their first pure-electric models: The e-tron of the Ingolstadt should come on the market at the end of the year, the EQC from Stuttgart 2019.
Both were officially presented however.
The launch of BMW iNext is scheduled for 2021.
In the focus of attention in Paris is the new 3ER.
This year from October 4 to 14, more than 250 exhibitors are being represented.
In addition to the car companies, motorcycle manufacturers and numerous mobility service and software providers will be there in their individual halls.
The trade show, which is celebrating its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in rotation with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016 came over one million visitors.

At least 380 people have lost their lives on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi during the severe earthquakes and subsequent tsunami.
Dozens still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken on Friday by two earthquakes.
The first quake was of magnitude 5.9, the second of magnitude 7.4.
Communications and transport links have been damaged among the severe property damage.
After the earthquake the tsunami erupted over the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a festival.
It is feared that the number of victims will definitely increase.
Numbers are so far only from Palu.
But numerous other communities along Sulawesi's west coast are also affected.

About 150 bikers celebrate a church service in Werdohl
On Sunday, Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne, celebrated the concluding service with a team of helpers for motorcyclists in the Friedenskirche in Eveking.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Friedenskirche in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the concluding service for the bikers was to be held here.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor in the Evangelical church of Westphalia and is therefore responsible for the pastoral interests of the high-HP cyclists.
Between April and September on the last Sunday of the month, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place at Nordhelle house.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Friedenskirche in Eveking.
There, some 150 bikers gathered on Sunday for a church service that was anything but ordinary.
Starting from 10 am, the heavy bikes lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
The biker brunch was the first agenda item and attendees had a chance to tuck into some coffee and cake or even a hearty Currywurst.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also in attendance.
Priest Dirk Grzegorek gave a sermon during the biker church service.
Singer-songwriter Valerie Lill accompanied the service with her music.
Although the bikers prefer the Blues-Rock, Valerie Lill struck rather calm and poetic notes, said pastor Frank Schröder.
This was definitely a novelty in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.

Füchtorf's Home Association celebrates a major festival: The milk comes after the apple
And Borisch was also active on the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly made apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused a big amount of interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated the life of an apple to his astonished spectators step by step from the ripe apple to apple juice.
Every now and then, Hartmann-Niemerg had help from the children to fill the apples in the big funnel.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely chopped mass.
Not many of the children could imagine how a tasty drink was to be made from it.
But they could even witness this important step on the late Friday afternoon.
Packed in molds and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces layer by layer, which looked a bit like chopped shreds.
Thanks to certain technical support, the last work step was now no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice gradually ran into a big vessel.
But the Füchtorf farmer also had bottled specialties with him.
So he opened his “treasure chest” and presented the latest Federweisser [alcoholic beverage] to the older visitors.
There was a lot of demand for the good “Made in Füchtorf” beverage.
In a comfortable atmosphere, the parents got to talking while the children were not only able to follow the process of pressing apples, but also discovered the bouncy castle that had been set up.
Active members of the Füchtorf comradeship of former soldiers were also involved in the festival and invited people to join in fun games at several stations.
The Home Association will also offer an action day next year.
Then, however, emphasized Gregor Krützkamp, the community center in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the site of the action.
Instead, a farmer will be visited.
That is also obvious because of the topic: Because then, it will all be about milk.

1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover facing fourth washout this season: "Shitty situation"
Frankfurt / Main After their fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed players from Hannover 96 and gave them courage.
However, there were not many positives to take away from the bottom team’s earlier 1:4 (0:2) result at Eintracht Frankfurt.
It is a crappy situation, but you have to come out on the other side as a team, said 96 player Pirmin Schwegler, adding: "This is of course disappointing, because you always try for the best result possible".
Victory continues to elude the players from Lower Saxony, for whom only Florent Muslija (86.) scored to narrow the gap. They remain at the bottom of the table with only two points and must be considered a relegation candidate in their current form.
By contrast, an excellent Ante Rebic led Frankfurt to celebrate their first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored for the DFB Cup winners in front of 46,300 spectators. After the successful dress rehearsal for the Europa League match against Lazio, Frankfurt move into the middle of the table on seven points.
Croatia’s Vice World Champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive move by the Hessians at his starting eleven debut while Hannover’s defense struggled to reign him in.
The striker battered after the World Cup, showed by his tempo and assertiveness why he is so valuable for Eintracht.
Besides Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, on loan from Liverpool FC, was called up to Frankfurt’s starting eleven for the first time and the team got off to a dynamic start.
The first sign of danger came in the form of Lucas Torró’s header (17th), which was deflected into the netting.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped by 96’s defense in a promising position. The defenders were led by the Brazilian Felipe, in for Kevin Wimmer, who suffered a last-minute back injury.
The home side’s lead was all but inevitable and completely justified.
After a defended corner kick, Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the box and Haller headed it in front of the goal, where Ndicka only had to tap it in.
It was the first Bundesliga goal for the defender from French second division team AJ Auxerre who had joined the club during the summer.
And Frankfurt increased the tally before the break.
This time, Haller passed to his fellow striker Rebic, who skillfully dribbled through the lines leaving 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser no chance.
At half-time Hannover Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his eleven and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt, two new attackers.
The Lower Saxony side showed more courage going forward but could not come up with any dazzling ideas until just before the end of the match when they at least managed to score and narrow the gap.
The Hessians were much more efficient.
After just under an hour Rebic started a solo and then crossed to De Guzmán, who just tapped the ball into the empty goal.
Playing against overstretched guests, Frankfurt could take it easy for the rest of the match, which also saw Jovic scoring with one minute to go.

Geisingen: Christians in Geisingen celebrate the Holy Cross festival
Catholics in Geisingen celebrate the Holy Cross festival on September 14 or on the Sunday after.
The festival service takes place at the town church, followed by a procession to the Church of the Holy Cross with the blessing.
At the Church of the Holy Cross lies Christus, who witnessed the Thirty Years' War and is said to have been shot by a Swedish soldier.
Blood flowed from the gunshot wound.
This resulted in a great pilgrimage to the Christus' resting place, which then led to the construction of the Church of the Holy Cross.
The construction is not finished yet, only the sanctuary is, the missing nave is indicated by the trees.
In his homily, Father Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
Inspite of the importance for the Geising parish, attendance was rather poor.
After the service, the procession to the Church of the Holy Cross took place and the final blessing concluded the ecclesiastical part of the cross festival.
The Catholic church choir has been inviting people to the secular part of the festival in the Catholic parish home for many years.
The choir members provided visitors with hearty food and a big selection of cakes and, appropriate for the weather, farm-fresh ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the facade, roof, the sandstone works and windows and the upcoming construction, which will last until next year.
After the scaffold has been standing for some time, the damage could be more accurately determined and the individual calls for bids could be prepare more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation is more expensive than planned, because the already existing damage hase worsended over the last few years, but also more damaged has been uncovered, which was only possible through the inspection by means of the scaffold.
The plinth plastering work is completed and before the winter, the natural stone work will begin and the involved parties hope to finish about half of this work this year.

Opening ceremony: New residential home in Neu-Ulm’s Münsterblickstraße
The Donau-Iller life aid is opening a new hostel for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
All those attending the ceremony agreed that "a very special house" is now opening its doors for its intended purpose.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the residential home provided by Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time, depend on its unique architecture.
Wider aisles, hallways and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas have all been part of architect Rudolf Bader’s concept.
Planning first began about eight years ago, when the former US Army officers’building was tested for its suitability for residents with disabilities: "The house was getting old and no longer up-to-date in terms of features," Bader explained looking back.
In 2016, excavators started rolling to demolish the house.
The new building was to be designed to be as welcoming and bright as possible, so that the residents could feel comfortable in it, says the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new residential home
The life aid invested approximately 4.6 million euro in the new construction.
The state of Bavaria contributed 2.4 million Euros, the district of Swabia 450,000 Euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both in terms of time and financially.
The Lebenshilfe’s managing director Jürgen Heinz thanked Bader this accomplishment.
The balance between a barrier-free and fireproof design has not always been easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and handymen built a home with many specifications, to allow residents the freedom to move even without outside help.
The same was expressed by the head of social services in the Schwaben district, Gertrud Kreutmayer: ‘The home is geared towards the special requirements of its residents, who need help with mobility’.
Comfort and functionality have been combined to good effect in the process, said Kreutmayer.
And also: ‘The property in this location is a real stroke of luck, because it no longer needs to be acquired in today’s situation’.
All in all, the new residential home on Münsterblickstrasse houses 30 people with disabilities on almost 1,500 square meters, divided into three residential groups.
Lebenshilfe managing director Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are paid union wages.

Germany: Schwesig complains about differences between East and West
Berlin - Prior to the anniversary of German unification, the vice-president of the SPD, Manuela Schwesig, appealed to the nation not to resign themselves to the discrimination of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity
We cannot permit ourselves to be satisfied with these differences,” said the minister president of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the “Tagesspiegel” on Sunday.
The goals must remain the same: to create equal living conditions across the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans work longer on average than people in Western Germany, but receive 15 percent less salary.
This is inexplicable, nearly 30 years after the German Unification, said Schwesig.

North Korea: Is this cute dog going to end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is to pour oil on troubled water between the two Koreas.
In an effort to ease ties with Seoul, Pyongyang has given the South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hounds as a gift.
On Sunday, Moons office announced that both dogs, about a year old reached the recipient already on Thursday.
They passed through the Panmunjom border with three kilograms of dog food, to help the animals ‘to settle in’.
The dogs with their thick, white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the People’s Democratic Republic of Korea.
The friendship gift was announced by the North at the third summit meeting this year between Moon and the North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un in mid-September in Pyongyang.
Both countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to make a joint candidancy for the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the process of the mutual rapprochement, Kim agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test system for rocket propulsion.

99 documents reflect Austria's eventful history
What is Austria?
At the 100-year anniversary of the republic that has been celebrated in this commemorative year for almost ten months, many new books appeared that answer this question mainly looking back over the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives, takes a very different approach in the magnificent "picture book" of Austria, which will be published on October 1.

A new week, a new opportunity for the government
Back to regulatory work - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of the grand coalition starting today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and also lastly from the CSU did not invoke the mantra "return to work".
That may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working people in this country to the legitimate question of what the difference really is between work and paperwork, but that's all.
Now the federal government is ready to devote itself again to the task of governing, they should not be distracted from this now with debates on terminology.
Whether Union and SPD can pull off something together after the provocations and disgraces of recent weeks, will possibly be seen on Monday.
The leaders of the governing parties will come together for the coalition committee in the evening.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to summon this session regularly, to defuse conflicts early on; lessons can be learned from all the disputes.
First of all, however, conflict-laden topics are on the agenda again with the diesel retrofits and the skilled labor immigration law.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants the car companies to get off lightly with an exchange premium - SPD and CDU consider the manufacturers to be under obligation to technically retrofit older diesels.
While over the weekend a rapprochement has emerged in the diesel crisis, the Union and SPD are still far apart in the planned skilled labor immigration law.
The SPD promotes a long-term perspective for failed asylum-seekers, who work or who are training.
The Union is strictly against the "track change" from the asylum system into the labor market.
There will be disputes amongst the coalition partners again - how could this be otherwise?
Not equal and equal has joined forces to form the grand coalition, but three partners with sometimes very different images of society and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without dispute, a subscribed society of such diverse, sometimes contradictory interests does not progress.
But to be constructive, dispute should not be exaggerated again for party tactical reasons regarding the question of being or not-being.
It is about politics, not theater.
Union and SPD are to argue - but must always have the reality of life of the people in view.
What is possible and is of benefit to many?
With this key question, both the diesel and the track change question can be pragmatically clarified - and confidence thereby regained.
Above all, that is what the people's parties must now fight for.

Pilz is investigating the Hartinger’s working hours
Close eyes on Minister
Is the Ministor for Labor in violation of labor law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to investigate this in more detail.
Seriously, day and night, her legists had worked on the social security reform, reported the social minister at the presentation of the reform two weeks ago exuberantly.
Liste Pilz candidate Daniela Holzinger is surprised by Beate Hartinger-Klein’s statement (FPÖ) - she brings this to the parliament’s attention now.
She assumes that ‘the minister is only trying to express her enthusiasm about the engagement of her team, and did not intend to convey any possible violations of the labor law with the cameras rolling’.
Nevertheless, now there are unanswered questions to acquit Hartinger "of any suspicion."

The police dig up a road in search of a woman’s corpse
Marxgrün - Lange did not want to comment on the matter to the police.
Now there is confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning digging has taken place on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The track in the Marxgrün area will be closed until Monday.
Earlier it had taken place that the investigator had used an archeology dog.
The dog together with his guide, trained especially for the smell of old human bones, was finally able to limit the relevant area to a few metres.
A soil anomaly was also discovered with scientists from Munich’s Technical University and the supreme Bavarian monument protection authority in the area of the road section mentioned.
For more than a year already the prosecutor and Criminal Police from Hof had worked on the case of the missing.
A cycle track was closed again and again at Marxgründ and investigated with sonar equipment, because the investigators suspected that Heike’s body could have been buried during the new construction of the state road 30 years ago.

Colored powder and eggs: Protests in Barcelona before the Catalonia’s anniversary
The controversial independence referendum took place on Monday in Catalonia.
But right before it begun the protests.
The autumn 2017 police operation was not forgotten by the separatists.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on 1 October 2017, in the downtown of Barcelona separatists clashed with police.
Among other things Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence activists with colored powder, as they were trying to prevent them from approaching the demonstration of National Police and Civil Guards.
With the demonstration about 3,000 police officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wanted to honor their colleagues who performed their duties in the polls last year during the illegal referendum.
An attempt to prevent citizens from voting lead to violence.
The Spanish media reported that the Catalan police formed a chain to keep the separatists and central security forces apart.
However, some of the about 6000 separatists tried to break the police chain by force, and were throwing at officials, among other things, paint bombs and eggs.
Citing the authorities it was said that six people had been arrested and 24 other were slightly injured.
The independence referendum took place for the first time on Monday.
Following the vote and subsequent decision to split off the prosperous region from Spain, in autumn 2017 the central government in Madrid put Catalonia under control.
The former regional president Carles Puigdemont has fled to Belgium.
Other politicians also escaped abroad.
However, several ministers of then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement remain in custody.
In December in the region were held new elections.
After the new Catalan government's inauguration in May, the forced administration was terminated.
Yet the new president insists on the ‘Right of self-determination’ of Catalans.

Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Complete helplessness: Goalless match between FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen
Rot-Weiß Ahlen still going nowhere.
FC Gütersloh only didn’t get further than a 0-0 draw.
The tail light and the third last of the league demonstrated complete helplessness in front of 438 spectators at Heidewald stadium.
The first half was rather dim in terms of entertainment.
Anyone who wanted to go get a beer or bratwurst could do it without worrying they would miss anything.
There was no risk of missing a goal opportunity, because there were virtually none.
The first shot on goal happened after half an hour.
Responsible for the first (harmless) shot on goal was Gütersloh’s Nick Flock in minute 28.
The best - and in principle only real - opportunity had the team from Ahlen, when FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling saved Cihan Yilmaz’ shot on goal from the edge of the penalty area in minute 32.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was an early substitution.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury. Sinan Aygün replaced him.
After the substitution, both teams decided to do something against the growing boredom.
In minute 48, Sebastian Mützel shot just over the goal from 18 meters and after one hour the Gütersloh player also appeared offensive for the very first time.
After a ball recapture by Matthäus Wieckowicz, this was quickly dealt with.
Nick Flock (minute 62) "crowned" the quick counterattack over Sinan Aygün with a lax shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they went one better with a header from Wieckowicz (minute 66) after a corner from former Ahlen player Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, substituting Martin Fuhsy for Marko Onucka (minute 60) and a little later Sebastian Mützel for Enes Güney (minute 70).
That lead to nothing.
The team from Ahlen did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
Only in the 91st minute did Cihan Yilmaz have the last chance, but that did not get them anywhere.
Angelo Daut tried to emphasize the positive afterwards: "I like that we kept a clean sheet." But unfortunately, both sides scored zero.
We were not as dangerous against goal in this match as against Holzwickede, even though our opponents did not want to play here, states RW Ahlen’s interim coach.
Offensively, "everything just happened somehow" against a team that "just wanted to defend.
At any rate, I did not feel that we could concede a goal," said Daut.
To his chagrin, however, the viewer did not feel like his team could score a goal, either.
The performance was too poor for that.

Thanksgiving Market in Reckenfeld: Good thing there are enough Kreimers
That is good news for Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann, and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfeld food bank, for whom these donations are intended.
The volunteers clarify: "These donations will remain in Reckenfeld."
At the opening the sky was a brilliant blue, but the square was a little empty, which was to change over the day.
Because: "It is such a friendly atmosphere, that is why we are here today," said one visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in a Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a bit of humor.
At short notice, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer stood in for the Brockmanns, who were to be weighed against food.
Ferdi Kreimer’s daughter Verena had fallen ill.
But there are enough Kreimers anyway.
And the "substitute" insisted on musically entertaining the ever increasing number of visitors.
This was so well received that people sang along to some folk songs late at night.
Just great, said a delighted Marcel Kreimer.
This year, mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date in his schedule.
He is happy to see so many engaged people manning their stands, most of them hailing from clubs and associations.
Strictly speaking, there should be no need for things like food banks, he said when thanking the men’s choir for their efforts.
Andreas Hajek praised everybody’s engagement, in the stands, and also included the additional festivals that took place in September and the ‘clean-up’ action.
Our garden city is getting a colorful coat of paint - things are really happening.
Next, the wreath was taken down from the maypole by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire department and taken into winter storage.
Many stands worked to provide sustenance.
Everything from sweet to savory was available.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has been living in Reckenfeld for a year, was creative about his scroll saw.
He offered veneer designs and beer mats with typical Reckenfeld motifs, among other things.
Three Reckenfeld beekeepers offered a special treat: "Reckenfeld honey", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has another specialty on hand.
Gingerbread in a glass, with honey from my own production of course.
Little Elsa kept coming back for seconds, that is how good the cake was.
It is this friendly atmosphere that makes visitors stay late into the evening hours even in the absence of stage events, which are not part of the fall festival.

Graffiti with a local political message: Unsuccessful advertising for a skate park
In Lengerich, unknown people have advocated for the construction of a skate park in a hardly beneficial way.
In several places, there are graffiti, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration on the request of the WN.
In at least one case, a criminal complaint for property damage has been filed with the police.
The three words "Skatepark for Lengerich!" are displayed in large letters on signs, among others at the Gempt-Halle and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that writing was found on the advertising sign on the staircase to the Gempt Bistro on September 19 after the career choice fair.
Since the short message was apparently "only" made with a marker, it could easily be removed.
A few days later, it was there again, but this time it was sprayed on, says Rottmann.
He assumes that the respective advertising sign has to be replaced.
This case is special by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are mentioned on the board.
If the skate park is built, its realization will also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already pledges, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the urban department of schools, sports and culture, without naming names.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the graffitied board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of a skate park.
After the old had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began.
The council finally chose the fire department parking lot.
However, this request was not implemented - apparently, too many factors were against a construction at this point.
At the end of June, it was all turned around again.
Members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg school.
Regarding the state of affairs, Jürgen Kohne says that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
Then, city council has the last word.
He assumes a decision will be reached this year, so that park can be built in 2019.

Bottlenecks in air traffic control are getting even worse
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the chaos affecting European air traffic in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
This year it was only wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and the storm will hit after that, head of the German air traffic union, Matthias Maas, told the German Press Agency ahead of the aviation summit on October 5 in Hamburg.
He said that the well known staff shortages plaguing European air traffic controllers are an important reason for the numerous delays and flight cancellations and that there is no quick fix to this problem.
Airlines and airports can make quick improvements for the coming year, but training new air traffic controllers takes four to five years, the unionist said.
He added that there are hardly any fully trained air traffic controllers available on the European market.
He pointed out that the Karlsruhe center monitoring Germany’s upper air space alone is short of some one hundred staff.
Maas again criticized the fact that different air transport trade unions were not invited to the summit.
Representatives from federal and state governments, air traffic controllers, the airlines, and the airports gather on Friday to tackle the causes of the delays.
If you want to talk about additional work and overtime, that will not work without us, said the head of the German air traffic union, many members of which work for the federally owned German air traffic control company DFS.
Maas again held the EU Commission’s guidelines responsible for the air traffic control predicament.
He asserted that traffic forecasts for the regulatory period up to 2019 had been far too low.
The resulting cost targets and personnel savings at the national air traffic control services now have a severe impact on daily operations, he stressed.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU), to promote regulations in Brussels that would not "keep on depriving air traffic controllers of oxygen".
He cautioned that, as things stand, the EU targets would be coordinated by 2024 and further tightening is to be expected.
According to Maas, the EU is exposed to constant lobbying pressure from the airlines.
Ryanair boss, Michael O'Leary and his colleagues have now reaped exactly what they have sown in recent years, said Maas.
He hopes that the high costs incurred by the airlines as a result of delays will lead them to think again.
The German air traffic union would work to improve the situation only if the DFS were to offer a "coherent agreement for future-oriented training and education," said Maas.
He further noted that the previously announced intake of 120 air traffic control students per year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for age-related personnel reductions.
It does not yet address the necessary staff expansion.

Procurement of public building and corruption prevention
Joint report on parallel audit submitted by the Czech Supreme Audit Ofice (NKÚ) and the German Bundesrechnungshof (BRH)
Introduction and overview
The procurement of goods and services by public-sector contracting agencies is of great importance both for the government and for the business community.
The government’s task is to use public resources as efficiently and economically as possible and to ensure fair and regulated competition.
In the European Union (EU), public contract awarding is key to the success of the single economic area.
In order to ensure a largely unrestricted competition in the field of crossborder procurement, awarding authorities also have to meet certain requirements imposed by the EU in awarding contracts where the contract value exceeds certain thresholds.
To this end, the EU Member States have to transpose EU procurement law into their national law and apply it.
This has already happened both in the Czech Republic and in Germany.
For contracts worth less than the EU thresholds, regulating public contract awarding procedures remains a matter for the individual countries.
Moreover, the contract award procedure is, as a rule, vulnerable to corruption.
In view of the generally high damage potential, awarding authorities are obliged to take reasonable action to fight and to rule out corruption and abusive favouritism in their contract award procedures (corruption prevention).
In January 2011, the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (Czech SAI – NKÚ) and the Bundesrechnungshof of Germany (German SAI – BRH) agreed to conduct parallel audits both of the EU-wide awarding of building contracts and of corruption prevention.
The audit focused on the application of EU procurement law as transposed into national law and corruption prevention of contracts for building construction and road construction and/or transport infrastructure.
The audit also covered contract awards below the EU thresholds with a view to corruption prevention.
The two SAIs’ audit findings are summarised in the joint report, which is also to be addressed to international institutions such as the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).
Fields of audit and audited bodies
The assessments performed by the German SAI are for the most part based on horizontal audits of the above-mentioned topics, which we carried out at German building authorities responsible for federal road and building construction in the years 2011–2012.
This included e.g. the construction of motorways and large building construction projects.
In addition to that, the German SAI included findings from previous audits in the assessment.
The assessments performed by the Czech SAI were based on audit findings generated in the years 2008–2012. The audits covered the construction of roads, railway lines, hydraulic engineering projects, large buildings (hospitals, cultural buildings, universities, etc.), and some other areas in the Czech Republic.
Federal contract award procedures in Germany are largely conducted by the construction administrations of the countries.
In the Czech Republic, the road and estimate construction administrations of the State have central responsibilities for awarding contracts relating to transport infrastructure.
In building construction, responsibility for contract award procedures is decentralised, i.e. the procedures are conducted by the entities which receive state budget funds.
In both countries, the services of self-employed professionals are used in individual stages of contract award procedures.
When comparing the assessments, differences in procurement legislation and structural peculiarities of the construction services and markets of both countries have to be observed.
Structure of procurement law in the two countries
In Germany, the conduct of EU-wide contract award procedures is governed by Acts of Parliament and delegated legislation.
Contract award procedures limited to Germany are governed by budgetary law and administrative regulations based on it .
Many supplementary provisions both for EU-wide and national contract awards are contained in internal administrative rules.
Further details concerning the requirements of EU procurement law and corruption prevention are set forth in the socalled “contract award manuals” of the Federal Government, in which the requirements are complemented or formulated in greater detail taking regard to judicial precedent in the field of procurement law.
In the Czech Republic, contract award procedure is governed exclusively by the respective Act on Public Procurement and other legal provisions, which apply to contract values both above and below the EU thresholds.
Procurement law was substantially amended in 2012.
The new provisions strengthened transparency in the management of public funds, opened the way for more competition and limited the opportunities for corruption in the contract award procedures.
Basic features of procurement law in the two countries
In both countries, especially the open procedure, the restricted procedure and the negotiated procedure are to be applied where contracts are to be awarded EU-wide.
In Germany, contracts below the EU threshold are awarded in accordance with the national procedures (public invitation to tender, restricted invitation to tender, negotiated contract), which, however, are aforementioned procedures. largely identical with the EU-wide contract award.
Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of preference for the open procedure (where tenders have to be invited EU-wide) and for the public invitation to tender (in case of merely national contract awards).
Under the open procedure and the public invitation to tender, every interested enterprise may submit a bid.
Another essential feature of German procurement law is the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
This is achieved mainly by dividing an overall public works project in trade-specific lots and part lots.
By awarding separate contracts for these lots, as many enterprises as possible, are to be given the chance to compete.
The two aforementioned characteristics of German procurement are time-tested tools for obtaining good value for money.
More than 330,000 construction firms with workforce of 1.9 mil. are registered in Germany.
In the Czech Republic, the EU-wide contract award procedures are also to be applied to public works contracts below the EU threshold.
An exception to this is the simplified procedure below threshold, where the contracting authorities may under certain conditions use considerably less strict procedure.
In agreement with EU law, Czech procurement law includes provisions according to which contracts are to be concluded, if competition is guaranteed and an advantageous price is obtained.
The present Czech legislation enables contracting authorities to choose between open and restricted procedure.
In the Czech Republic, there are about 85,000 registered building companies, out of it 1,900 building contractors with 20 or more workers each.
Aggregate volume of public works contracts awarded by contracting agencies and shares of contract award types in the two countries
In 2011, the total volume of construction works in Germany totalled € 307 billion.
Of these, € 45.5 billion (equivalent to 15 per cent) were accounted for by public contracts which, apart from contracts awarded by the Federal Government, included contracts awarded by the Federal States and municipalities.
The total volume of federal building and road construction projects (without railway construction and hydraulic engineering) amounted to € 8.5 billion.
In 2011, the breakdown of federal contracts for building construction and construction of longdistance roads by type of award procedure was as follows:
80.7 % Open procedures and public invitations to tender 12.7 % Restricted procedures and restricted invitations to tender 6.6 % Negotiated procedures and discretionary awarding of contracts 33.2 % of which were EU-wide tenders.
In 2011, the volume of public works in the Czech Republic totalled € 4.7 billion, which accounts for about 25 per cent of the total volume of all building works in the Czech Republic.
In 2009 the volume reached € 7.8 billion e.g. 37% of the total volume of public works.
Structure of types of awards in 2011: 65,1 % open procedure 14,3 % restricted procedure 9,5 % negotiated procedure 8,4 % simplified procedure for awards below the threshold 2.7 % other procedures
The data comprise all public contracts for supplies, services and construction works awarded by public contracting authorities in 2011.
These figures show that the parallel audits of both countries focus on an important part of public contract awarding; corruption prevention, that always has to be observed when awarding contracts, has a significant financial impact and the open procedure and/or open tendering are of key importance when awarding contracts.
Summary of the basic results
The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Supreme Audit Institution of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have conducted parallel audits of EU-wide awarding of public works contracts and corruption prevention in their respective countries.
In this context, the working groups of the two SAIs compared the legal frameworks and administrative regulations in the Czech Republic and in Germany and the results of their parallel audits which they conducted specifically in the fields of building construction and road construction.
The key findings were:
The EU Directives on the awarding of public works contracts have been transposed into national law both in the Czech Republic and in Germany (items 1 and 3.1).
Corruption prevention is not only the purpose of the EU Directives but also of the national procurement rules of both countries, which partly differ as to their points of emphasis and degree of detail.
In both countries, an essential requirement to be met by the tender documents is that they have to include all information needed for appropriately drawing up bids.
The specifications must be neutral and not include any requirements that restrict competition.
The tender documents in Germany largely complied with these requirements.
In the Czech Republic the problem of determining the subject of the contract largely exists.
In Germany, public works are to be divided into lots whenever possible in order to promote competition.
According to the BRH’s findings, this requirement was largely met in Germany.
The NKÚ’s audits showed that awarding large volumes of public road works without division into lots or division in only very large lots may impair competition and result in a restriction to only a few large companies.
These restrictions of market potential may result in major cost increases and bear the risk of undue price negotiations and collusion.
Legal provisions of both countries enable, under certain conditions, the contracting authorities to award contracts of additional or modified construction works if the need for this arises after concluding the contract (item 4.1).
The respective requirements for determining the type of award were largely complied with in both countries.
According to the provisions of the Czech Republic, the contracting authorities may freely choose between open and restricted procedures.
In contrast, the relevant German provisions in procurement and budgetary law stipulate the precedence of the open procedure both for EU-wide tenders and for national tenders known as public invitations to tender.
This enables more enterprise to submit bids.
This reduces the risk of corruption, makes price-fixing by collusion of bidders difficult and produces the best results in terms of value for money.
In the case of major work projects whose estimated total value reached or exceeded a threshold set by the EU, the contracting authorities audited always applied Europe-wide tendering procedures.
When determining the type of award procedure, the correct estimation of the contract value is of essential importance.
In Germany, databases for objective setting estimated public works prices are used, especially in the area of building construction.
The data is based on evaluations of construction projects already completed.
In the Czech Republic, the databases are used only in the area of road construction, but they are not efficient tool as yet (item 4.2).
Where contracts for work projects are to be awarded by EU-wide tendering procedures, prior information and contract notices have to be published. This is to strengthen competition by allowing interested enterprises to prepare at an early stage for submitting bids.
Kontrolovaní zadavatelé zpravidla tento požadavek plnili.
V ojedinělých případech byly zjištěny omyly ve zveřejněných informacích, nesprávná aplikace požadavků a nedostatek kontrol, což mohlo konkurenci poškodit (bod 4.3).
The selection of bidders for participation in restricted award procedures is particularly vulnerable to manipulation.
Under EU law, the number of bidders invited must be sufficiently high to guarantee genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, non-discriminatory and must be published in advance.
In addition to EU requirements, the contracting authorities in both countries are to alternate as frequently as possible among the enterprises to be invited when selecting participants.
In Germany, there are partly very detailed requirements to counteract the risk of manipulation.
In some cases, the audited bodies did not take regard to the requirements.
In the Czech Republic, the selection decisions made were not always plausible (item 4.4).
In both countries, the contracting authorities have to ensure, during the tender stage, that all enterprises interested in submitting a tender receive identical information.
To avoid collusion that would restrict competition, any contacts among these enterprises and between them and independent professionals that were involved in drawing up the specifications have to be prevented to the greatest extent possible.
The corresponding provisions in Germany are more extensive than those in the Czech Republic.
However, the audited construction administrations in Germany did not comply with requirements in some cases (item 4.5).
In both countries, the opening of the bids must comply with the cross-check and transparency principles.
The requirements for the marking, documentation, preservation and secrecy of the bids are to restrict the scope for manipulation and are particularly detailed in Germany.
The audits in both countries revealed only few deficiencies (item 4.6).
Examination and evaluation of the bids are regulated in both countries by requirements for structural organisation and procedures.
The respective German rules are more comprehensive but were not always, complied with by the audited contracting authorities.
For instance, contracting authorities passed bids on to third parties for examination without first inspecting them and without adequately documenting any conspicuous feature.
The bids were thus inadequately protected against subsequent manipulations (item 4.7).
On completion of EU-wide contract award procedures, the participating předem informováni. Důvodem je dát účastníkům řízení možnost nechat přezkoumat rozhodnutí o udělení zakázky.
Toto pravidlo právní ochrany je rovněž určeno k zabránění korupčních aktivit.
Česká právní úprava řeší otázku právního přezkoumání zadávacího řízení i u národních řízení.
Pouze v ojedinělých případech nebylo plnění informačních povinností náležitě zabezpečeno. (bod 4.8).
The documentation of the contract award procedures by the audited construction authorities in the two countries was not always complete or plausible.
In the case of some procedures, the transparency requirement, which applies throughout the EU, had not been adequately observed in the contract award memos.
Moreover, some of the deficiencies found diminished the corruption prevention effect of the documentation.
The contracting authorities of both countries largely complied with their reporting duties (item 4.9).
Fundamentals of EU procurement law and corruption prevention
European procurement law
In order to guarantee free competition and free movement of services and goods within the European Union, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, inter alia, the Directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts (Directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of contracts) and the Directive on the coordination of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the application of review procedures to the award of public supply and public works contracts (Remedies Directive), that were to be transposed into national law.
In particular, the general procurement principles of the European Union include the competition requirement, the equal treatment requirement or prohibition of discrimination and the transparency requirement.
To accomplish these objectives, the Directive on the coordination of EU-wide procedures for the award of contracts includes provisions relative to construction projects the expected order total of which reaches or exceeds € 5 million.
Such provisions impact especially on the contents of tender documents, the applicable type of procedure, the publication of certain information prior to, during and after the contract award procedure, the compliance with the deadlines for the receipt of tenders, the documentation of the contract award dokumentaci celého zadávacího řízení; the qualification requirements that may be imposed on tenderers and the criteria according to which a tender is selected.
The tenderers’ legal protection is governed by the Remedies Directive.
In the case of potential breaches of procurement law, enterprises may have the contracting authority’s decision reviewed within review procedures.
Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the European Union Directives into national law.
Corruption prevention
Significance of corruption prevention
In neither country is there a legal definition of what constitutes corruption.
In general, corruption is understood to mean the misuse of a position of confidence for private advantage.
As a rule, it is implied that such abuse is incited by those who benefit from it.
Corruption may hamper competition and may cause substantial economic damage.
According to estimates, global costs caused by corruption, amount to 5 % of the global economic output.
For the European Union area, these costs are estimated at an amount equivalent of 1 % of the area’s economic output.
If the contracting authority is involved, agreements restricting competition or unfair behaviour may undermine confidence in the integrity and the capability of the public administration to function.
Thus, preventing corruption is an essential task for awarding authorities.
Practices and procedures are to be reviewed to adress areas that are especially vulnerable to corruption so that appropriate anticorruption measures can be taken.
Taking preventive measures and carrying out effective controls may substantially reduce vulnerability of decision-making processes to corruption.
As a rule, the awarding of works contracts is considered to be particularly vulnerable to corruption.
Measures to prevent corruption
In Germany, corruption is prosecuted under penal and employment law, this especially applies to active and passive bribery and to the undue acceptance of benefits and undue granting of benefits.
In order to prevent corruption, the German Federal Government issued a guideline together with recommendations on corruption prevention in the federal administration , according to which, in addition to risk analyses, the following principles shall apply to contract award procedures: precedence of open tendering multiple control principle and transparent decision-making separation of planning, awarding of contracts and accounting precise and full documentation of procurement procedures.
In addition, further provisions having a preventive effect against corruption have become part of procurement law.
In 2011, the federal department responsible introduced an IT-supported system to monitor the awarding of federal road construction contracts.
By means of this system, procurement data, e.g. estimated costs, order total and private independent professionals involved, can be fully recorded and analysed with a view to finding irregularities.
In the Czech Republic, corruption is similiarly prosecuted under penal and employment law.
The legal requirements of transparency, equal treatment of bidders and prohibition of any discrimination are the most important bases of corruption prevention.
Anti-corruption measures in the area of public procurement have been set down by the government in a strategy on fight against corruption for 2011–2012 which was updated for 2013–2014.
Some parts of these measures were already incorporated into public procurement law and respective implementing regulations.
The new legislation essentially contains the following provisions decrease of contracts for small scale obligation of prior contract award announcement by the contracting authority, including the reasons of the contract prohibition of limiting the number of tenderers in restricted procedures and thus impossibility of limiting the number of tenderers based on drawing obligation of publishing the contract awarded, including the supplements obligation of publishing the real price and the list of sub-contractors
Audit results related to the successive phases of the contract award procedure
Tender documents
Tender documents The tender documents must include all information which the bidders need for preparing their tenders in due form.
In particular, the tender documents must permit accurate costing.
To ensure this, bidders must not be burdened with risks they cannot calculate.
The tender documents mainly consist of the specifications. They also include the requirements for proving the bidders’ qualification and the criteria for selecting the most cost-effective bid.
Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention
Requirements provided for by EU law especially focus on technical specifications.
All bidders must have equal access to them and they are to restrict competition as little as possible.
As a matter of principle, specifications have to be product-neutral.
Any details as to specific products or manufacturers as part of the technical specifications are therefore admissible only within narrow limits.
To avoid the inclusion in the tender documents of requirements that restrict competition is an elementary principle of corruption prevention.
Furthermore, it is necessary to avoid ambiguities or inaccurate information when preparing the tender documents, since such deficiencies provide a scope for speculations in connection with the preparation of bids and for manipulations in the evaluation of bids.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
Both countries have transposed EU legal provisions about technical specifications into their national law.
As a matter of principle, specifications have to be product-neutral without requiring any particular brands.
As a matter of principle, the specifications must outline the supplies and services required, detailing the number of units of work or supplies.
In this normal case, prices are to be stipulated by units of work or supplies (e.g. euro/m² or euro/item).
Only in exceptional cases is it admissible to define the work to be done in terms of functional objectives.
As a rule the specifications need to be complete and unambiguous.
They have to include precise quantities and may not comprise work or supplies whose necessity is uncertain.
Remuneration in lump sum form or input of working time should be avoided whenever possible.
These provisions are to preclude speculations and manipulations based on ambiguous specifications in the tender documents.
The specifications must enable each bidder to prepare his bid safely and without extensive preliminary work.
The invitation to tender is to be announced only after completion of the tender documents.
Differing provisions
In the Czech Republic there is no obligation to invite construction tenderers for lots.
The contracting authority is entitled to subdivide a public contract into several separate lots, if it is admitted by the nature of the subject-matter of such public contract.
In Germany, there is a requirement in principle to divide construction projects into lots, either divided by quantities (partial lots) and/or specialties (specialised lots).
This is to enable small and medium-sized contractors to compete, to increase the number of potential bidders and to make price-fixing more difficult.
This type of award is considered as usually providing best value for money.
In the Czech Republic, all tender documents, both for national and EU-wide awards, must include the evaluation criteria.
This is to inform the bidder completely and exhaustively about the criteria according to which his tender is to be evaluated.
In Germany, the requirement to indicate evaluation criteria in the EU-wide contract notice or, failing that, in the tender documents applies only to EU-wide invitations to tender.
In national contract award procedures, the evaluation criteria need only be included in the contract award memo, which is an internal administrative document.
Where the tender documents are prepared by commissioned independent professionals, the German regulations require any information to be omitted from the tender documents that may help to identify the (firms of) architects or civil engineers involved.
This is to prevent individual contractors from obtaining any additional information or other undue competitive advantages through contacts with these independent professionals without the contracting authority being aware of this.
This is also the reason why independent professionals may neither post tender documents nor make planning documents available for inspection.
The contracting authority is the sole contact of the contractors.
At present, no similar provision is in force in the Czech Republic.
In case of big construction projects, the necessity of extra or modified works almost always occurs after conclusion of the original contract.
Legislation in both countries enables to award the extra works contract up to a certain threshold to the same supplier without having to conduct an award procedure and to publish a contract notice.
The volume of extra works as per both European and German legislation must not exceed 50% of original contract price.
In addition, extra works need to be indispensable and identifiable as extra components to the major contract.
In the Czech Republic, stricter limit of 20% applies to such award procedure without publishing a contract notice.
However, this may bring higher risks of time delays of project realization and eventual involvement of a new constructor in the project just underway.
If the extra works contract is also awarded to the supplier already contracted, German law stipulates the rules not enabling contractors to arbitrarily increase the prices of such modified and/or extra works.
Such calculations must be done with reference to the agreed prices of the original contract.
Apart of extra works, less works in construction may occur.
In Czech republic, less works cannot be mixed with additional extra works.
Basic audit findings
BHR
Technical specifications and productneutral invitation to tender
In individual cases, specifications referred to national technical requirements or standards that had in the meantime been replaced by EU standards.
In some cases, specifications also contained data requiring certain brands for example for graffiti resistance systems, water stops or noise abatement tiles –, although this was not needed.
In some cases specifications were so detailed that only one product could fulfil the requirements.
Bills of quantities subdivided into items
In none of the procedures audited did the German SAI detect any cases of non-compliance with the general requirement to invite tenders for supplies and services according to bills of quantities subdivided into items.
Comprehensiveness of specifications
In most of the cases reviewed, the tender documents had been fully elaborated before the process of soliciting bids was launched.
However in various cases, documents had to be modified during the tendering process to pay due regard to changing items or time schedules.
In isolated cases, tender documents contained work or supplies whose necessity was uncertain.
One tender document on demolition work we looked at consisted almost exclusively of such items.
Lots and criteria according to which the contract is to be awarded
In a large number of cases, the required justification for not subdividing the lots of services into partial lots was not given.
The criteria we studied according to which the contract is to be awarded gave us no reason to point out shortcomings.
Inclusion of names of self-employed professionals
In a number of documents the commissioned independent professionals involved were mentioned.
The names were identified on the cover sheets or on the plans or opinions attached.
In one case, the contracting authority even called upon bidders to contact the architect explicitly mentioned regarding questions on the tender.
In building construction projects such cases were caused in the first place by the self-employed persons commissioned to develop the specification documents.
The building administration services stated that they did not have enough staff to control the tender documents in detail.
NKÚ
Technical specifications and product-neutral invitation to tender
In case of public procurement for 12 apartments building, there was reference to concrete supplier and type of product mentioned in the specification.
Contracting authority did not admit using of other comparable types of products. and did not give reason for insisting on these concrete suppliers and products.
In connections with the constructing of various university facilities, the tender documents specified concrete suppliers and products.
Overall list of specifications with partial specifications
In case of constructions of some industrial zones contracting authority did not clearly specify the volume and type of requested works and supplies in the list of measurement, and as measuring unit he specified for each building only the built up volume in cubic meters.
Comprehensiveness of specifications
During the procurement of public contract for construction of a road circle, the tender documentation for restricted procedure was four times changed in the period of August– September 2009.
The reason was increasing of scope of delivery and changes of technical conditions.
In case of some social buildings construction the tender documentation showed mistakes which resulted in necessity of extra works (precise location missing, technical and constructional research insufficient, drawings missing).
Tender documentation for construction of a big library described the elements of interior only without specifying product quality requirements.
As a result, some sub suppliers provided some very expensive and above standard equipment.
Lots and criteria according to which the contract is to be awarded
In the Czech Republic, no obligation of dividing public works projects into partial lots or awarding partial contracts is in place.
Analysis of three big parts of a road circle construction proved that within their public procurement in parts (individually by selected installations), savings amounting up to 31.6 million EUR could have been achieved, out of total of achieved public contract prices amounting to 620.3 million EUR.
For example, in case of offer price for 6 individual construction objects as 6 separate parts of one public contract, the savings of 2.5 million EUR (i.e. 25%) could have been achieved.
If the construction works of 20 bridges had been awarded as a separate part of one public contract, the savings amounting to 11.5 million EUR (i.e. 25%) could have been achieved.
In case of road constructions, contracting authority imposed very extensive requirements for references as suitability criteria.
In tender documentation of open procedure for one part of a motorway construction, contracting authority requested, among others, such experience of a supplier, proving his realization of at least three road construction projects worth 28 million EUR each, finalized or put into operation within the last 5 years.
In the Czech Republic, there are not more than 9 suppliers complying with the above prerequisite.
Open public procurement for another part of a motorway construction included 6 separate construction works, where the contracting authority demanded minimum yearly construction volume of construction works worth € 480 million within the last 3 years.
Podle provedeného rozboru získalo dvě třetiny finančního objemu zakázek v oblasti pozemních komunikací (62,5 mld. Kč z 92,5 mld. Kč) v letech 2008 až 2009 pět firem buď samostatně, nebo v rámci sdružení.
In case of together 46 contract award procedures worth € 528 million, there were just two or even one only tenderer.
NKÚ pointed out that restriction of the market potentional may result in major cost increases.
Area of extra works
In case of a road circle construction, contracting authority did not conclude written contract for delivery of extra works (in two cases) and he did not contracted those extra works according to any of procedures prescribed by law.
Value of extra works amounted in the first case up to € 6.7 million without VAT (increase by 21%), in second case up to € 165.4 million without VAT (increase by 91%).
The reason was an unclear determination of quantity a quality features of works.
In case of various University facilities the contracting authority did not comprise some works and deliveries into the tender documentation even if their need and necessity for construction completion and for final inspection were known just when the contract had been awarded. These works and deliveries were done on basis of addendums to the contract between contracting authority and supplier in negotiation procedure without publication.
The volume of extra works overpassed the national limit 20% of the original contract.
In connection with the construction of a large court building, the contracting authority reserved the right to award contracts for additional work without invitation to tender.
During construction, the contracting authority increased the contract volume by € 2 million.
The unit prices for the additional work commissioned without competition were considirably higher than comparable work done by the same contractor.
Other findings
Based on selected sample of constructions, NKÚ found out that the average costs of construction of 1 km section of the four-lane motorway in the Czech Republic amounts up to € 14.6 million.
According to the long term data from the Federal Ministry of Construction of Germany, the average costs of 1 km section of the four-lane motorway in Germany amount up to € 10.4 million.
This comparison suggests, that construction of a motorway in the Czech Republic is more costly compared to Germany.
Summarised findings
The basic legal provisions about tender documents are largely identical in both countries and comply with the requirements of EU law.
Their purpose is both to ensure comprehensive and fair competition and to prevent corruption.
The specifications must be sufficiently precise to enable bidders to accurately calculate the costs and prepare their tenders.
Moreover, this requirement is to limit the scope for speculation and the contracting authority is to be protected against the need to make contracts for extra work later.
In Germany, the basic legal provisions about tender documents are supplemented by additional regulations that are to further reduce the possibilities for restricting competition and for effecting manipulations.
While no similarly detailed requirements of this kind exist in the Czech Republic, higher transparency is achieved there by the publication of the evaluation criteria.
The requirements for specifications have largely been complied with in both countries.
In some cases, however, it was necessary to object to deviations that may have resulted in restrictions of competition.
The rule in force in Germany that requires the segmentation of large work projects into lots promotes competition and cost-effective results.
The NKÚ has found that, in the Czech Republic, the award of large works contracts without segmentation into lots or segmentation into very large lots may restrict the circle of bidders to a small number of large enterprises.
As a result of the very extensive requirements for reference imposed in the Czech Republic for selecting bidders for road works, public contracts are awarded to only a small circle of bidders and small and medium-sized enterprises are not given the chance to compete.
A limited number of bidders also increases the risk of price-fixing and other forms of collusion.
Concerning the award of contracts for extra or modified works and the remuneration for such work, the regulatory approaches differ between the two countries.
According to both European and German legislation, extra works not exceeding 50% of the original contract price can be awarded without tendering procedure and contract notice.
In the Czech Republic stricter limit of 20% applies.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This limit is often overstepped by contracting authorities.
The reason is an insufficient definition of public works.
If the limit of 20% is exceeded, the extra works must be awarded on the basis of a tendering procedure with contract notice.
By dividing work into lots, restrictions of competition and the resulting detrimental consequences can be avoided.
Determining the type of award and taking regard to the EU threshold
By determining the type of award, the contracting authority defines the number of potential contractors participating in the competition.
The contracting authority may leave the number of potential contractors and bidders largely unrestricted or may restrict the number by opting for a restricted procedure.
In the case of work projects whose value reaches or exceeds a threshold set by the EU, EU-wide tendering procedures must be applied.
Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention
When determining the type of award, the contracting authority especially has to comply with the requirements of European law on competition and transparency.
If the estimated total contract value of the construction work to be performed reaches or exceeds the current EU threshold of €5 million, it is always required that the contract be awarded EU-wide by open or restricted procedure.
In exceptional cases, negotiated procedure or competitive dialogue is admissible.
Where construction projects reach or exceed the EU threshold, the contracting authority may deviate to a restricted extent from the principle of EU-wide contract awarding and may award contracts by national procedure, if the estimated contract value of the lot concerned is below € 1 million and the total value of these lots does not exceed 20% of the estimated total contract value.
It is not allowed to inappropriately divide a project by its nature single construction project without compelling reasons or deliberately estimate its cost too low in order to avoid the obligation in principle to carry out a EU-wide procedure for awarding the works contract.
Since restrictions of competition substantially increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of the type of award is of major importance for purposes of corruption prevention.
The detailed justification of the choice of type of award and the considerations made about the obligation to apply EU procurement law are important parts of the documentation of the contract-award procedure.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
Both countries have completely implemented in national law the EU legal requirements for contract award procedures and thresholds.
Differing provisions
The Czech Republic has made arrangements to apply the principle of equal validity of open and restricted procedures laid down in the directive to its national awards of work contracts.
Open and restricted procedures may always be freely chosen without the need to document or justify the decision. Other types of procedure are only permitted where certain legally defined conditions are met.
Differing from that arrangement, the relevant German provisions of budgetary law and of the guidelines for preventing corruption as a rule give preference to open procedure or public invitation to tender.
Other types of procedure – including even restricted procedure or restricted tendering – are permitted only in exceptional cases, which are exhaustively determined by procurement law.
Such an exceptional case must be plausibly justified and documented.
The principle of preference for open procedure or public invitation to tender is to guarantee competition that is as little restricted as possible and to prevent opportunities for manipulation and for price-fixing among bidders by deciding in advance to choose certain tenderers.
In Germany, the principle of public tendering is a central element of corruption prevention.
The correct estimation of expected prices of a public contract is an essential basis for deciding the adequate type of public contract award procedure.
When estimating the costs of public building construction projects, the construction administrations in Germany can rely on planning and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations.
These databases have been compiled through analyses of completed construction projects. These databases include, among other information, standard cost figures for types of buildings, building units, building components or individual building work.
Based on such standard cost figures, it is eventually possible to estimate the contract value of a planned project or building work to be commissioned.
Only a few construction administrations in Germany already have similar databases for road construction.
However, it is intended to implement such databases nationwide.
Contracting authorities in the Czech Republic do not use any central database or average prices of comparable construction projects for determining the expected costs of a public contract for building constructions.
In most cases, cost determinations are based on estimates of the entity that funds the project or result from the amount of funds made available to the construction administration entity in question.
The measures for standardizing are in initial stage only.
On the basis of the programme of corruption fighting for the period of 2011–2012, the respective ministries work out the data base of customary prices of standardized commodities.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The data base should serve as set of information about construction and assembling works, materials and products, and other data to enable the calculation of necessary costs and determination of unit prices.
Ministry of Transport issued price data base for transport constructions as means of price controlling, which are currently updated.
The database is intended to determine the price in project (investment) plan, and they should play comparative function within further phases of construction preparatory works.
Key audit findings BRH
Choice of tendering procedure
The contracting authorities audited largely invited tenders under open procedure or public invitation to tender, thus complying with the requirements of budgetary and procurement law.
In 2011, 59.5% of the aggregate contract volume of federal construction projects in the field of building construction was accounted for by public tendering.
In road construction, this share was 94.8%.
In some case where non-public tendering was chosen, we found that the reasons for the contracting authorities’ infringement of the principle of open procedure or public invitation to tender were not stated in detail.
In the course of a horizontal audit, the BRH found, on the basis of information compiled about more than 16,000 contract award procedures, that the restricted procedures have a clear disadvantage, where competition is concerned, in comparison to public procedures and public invitations to tender and that they also increase the risks of manipulation and corruption.
Public tenders in the field of building construction elicited more than twice as many bids as restricted tenders and nearly three times as many bids as awards under negotiated procedure.
Our study also revealed that the bid prices quoted in restricted procedures and negotiated procedures were 6% and 10% higher respectively than those quoted in public procedures.
Parallel studies of the Federal Building Ministry and of a Land court of audit confirmed the differences in value for money obtained by public and by restricted procedures.
The Federal Building Ministry’s performance study even revealed that the prices quoted in restricted procedures were twice as high as those quoted in public procedures.
Taking regard to the EU threshold
In respect of those work projects whose aggregate contract value was estimated at more than € 5 million, the construction authorities audited usually made contract awarding plans in which they specified which works were to be awarded by EU-wide tender and which by national tender.
According to the contract awarding plans, the share of those works that required Europe-wide tendering always exceeded 80% of the total works.
There was no evidence of circumvention of the requirement to invite tenders Europe-wide by excessively low cost estimates.
However,in some cases, as a result of errors in the calculation of total contract value, the minimum share of EU-wide tendering was undercut.
During the execution of work, some construction authorities illicitly changed the determinations made in the contract awarding plan.
They did not give any reasons for these changes and did not prove that the minimum share of EU-wide tendering continued to be complied with.
The share of EU-wide tendering according to the accounts for the projects was usually lower than laid down in the contract awarding plan.
Where the expected contract values of construction projects exceeded the EU threshold, the construction authorities did not apply EU-wide tendering to all individual lots worth more than €1 million.
Instead, they awarded the respective contracts under national procedures without giving sound reasons for the necessity of deviating from the requirement.
NKÚ
Choice of tendering procedure
In the case of several large-scale building projects, e.g. the construction of some motorway sections, of facilities for a big sports event and of housing projects, the contracting authorities split one project into several parts, although these partial contracts were of the same or similar character.
Splitting resulted in decrease of expected value under the fixed limit, and the contracts were thereafter awarded in less strict under limit procedure, or even out of law regime.
Methods for calculating the estimated contract value
Price databases set up for transport infrastructure works did not appear as sufficient tool for estimating contract volumes with some degree of accuracy.
They originated from just realized public procurements, which comprised eventual lacks of economy, construction over-works or excessive profit of suppliers.
The actual prices for three sections of the road circle were about 37% below the determined price from the database.
Ministry of transport updated the databases in a way to reflect not only the bid prices of the past years, but even comparison with comparable markets and index numbers of price progress in the area of construction.
As far as the building construction concerns, the estimative price was based on budget of project architects or estimation of investors.
The true price than varies considerably.
Assumed price of a big library reconstruction was doubled compared to the contract price, however, based on eight addendums, in process of realization the final price increased by € 2.1 million, i.e. by 27%.
Similarly, when constructing a library despository, the true price was by 33% lower compared to assumed price and prices increased during realization.
In other cases, the price of successful bidder is higher compared to assumed price and moreover, during realization it still increases.
In case of a big library construction the assumed price increased by € 16 million, i.e. by 22%, and in case of construction of a justice palace, the volume of financial needs increased during the works disproportionately (by 139%) compared to increase of function surfaces (12%).
Summarised findings
Since both countries have implemented in national law the EU provisions about the choice of type of awarding procedure and about taking regard to the EU threshold, the respective national provisions are largely identical.
However, the principle of public procedure or public tendering applicable in Germany is stricter than the EU provisions and the national provisions in force in the Czech Republic.
Compared to the restricted contract-award procedures, public procedure or public tendering gives more businesses the opportunity to participate in competition.
These types of contract award procedure generate a large number of bids and the best results in terms of value of money.
Corruption prevention is enhanced considerably, since the circle of candidates is not restricted by decisions taken beforehand by the contracting authority which leave room for manipulation and for price fixing among bidders.
The studies have confirmed the advantage obtained through the German rule that preference must be given to public procedure or public invitation to tender.
Czech legal rules enable the contracting authorities to award a contract in open or restricted procedure.
However, the latest amendment of procurement law has introduced a general prohibition to limit the number of bidders in procedures that involve a prior competition for participation.
The restricted procedure has now become very similar to the open procedure.
In Germany, the contracting authorities have largely complied with the requirement to give preference to open procedure or public invitation to tender, whereas in the Czech Republic some projects have been divided, which is not allowed, in order to circumvent the requirements governing the choice of the type of awarding procedure.
However, in Germany in some cases the EU threshold has not been taken regard to, ensuing that the minimum share of EU-wide tendering was undercut.
In the Czech Republic, no satisfactory solution facilitating the correct calculation of expected costs of construction works and construction projects does yet exist.
The construction authorities should ensure, if applicable, by means of more extensive controls that the requirements governing the choice of type of awarding procedure and the volume of contracts to be awarded EU-wide are complied with or should create the conditions necessary to be able to calculate costs accurately.
Prior information and contract notice
Where contracts for work projects are to be awarded by EU-wide tendering procedures, the contracting authority is to publish a contract notice for interested businesses outlining the contracts to be awarded.
Prior information and contract notices are an important basis for EUwide
Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention
The prior information notice has to include the essential specifications of the intended work project.
These notices are required in the case of work projects whose estimated total contract value is equal to or higher than the EU threshold and where the contracting authority wishes to shorten the deadlines for submitting tenders in open or restricted procedures.
The contracting authority has to publish a contract notice with detailed information on any public works contract that requires EU-wide tendering.
Once published, this information is binding on the contracting authority.
Among other information, the contract notice has to include the specifications, the deadlines for the procedure and the performance of the contract, the special requirements, the award criteria and their weighting.
The EU-wide common procurement vocabulary (CPV) must be used to describe the subject of the contract.
The prior information and contract notices are published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the buyer profile of the contracting authority.
To prevent any discrimination of foreign interested parties, notices published at national level may not contain any additional information and may not be published before the text of the notice has been posted to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union.
Incomplete or inaccurate information in the contract notice may impair competition and perhaps even facilitate manipulation.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
Both countries have fully implemented the EU provisions on prior information and contract notices in national law.
Differing provisions
In the Czech Republic, prior information and notices must also be published for the works contracts for which EU-wide tendering is not required.
Contract award procedures may not start earlier than one month after the publication of prior information in the EU’s Official Journal (in case of EU-wide award procedures) and in the national official gazette (in case of all award procedure).
The publication of prior information can only be omitted in exceptional cases.
In Germany, the publication of prior information is not needed in cases where no EU-wide tendering is required.
In case of national tendering procedures public invitations to tender and competitions for participation preliminary to restricted invitations to tender must be publicly announced on the Federal Government’s website and, where appropriate, in newspapers orjournals.
In case of restricted invitations to tender without competition for participation, notices have to be published where the estimated contract value amounts to or exceeds € 25,000 (ex ante transparency).
Preliminary information notices must set forth all planned lots of the work projects.
Given the small volumes of works contracts awarded in Germany, this is an important requirement.
As the number of work projects divided into lots for purposes of tendering is much smaller in the Czech Republic, this provision is much less important there.
Key audit findings
BRH
Preliminary information
The contracting authorities audited published prior information for all public works projects that involved work to be contracted out by EU-wide tender.
However, in the case of some open procedures, they shortened the deadlines for tendering at a time when the required minimum period of 52 days between sending preliminary information and sending the publications had not yet expired.
In the case of other shortened procedures, tenders were invited only when the twelve-month validity period of the preliminary information had already expired and had not yet been extended.
Many publications of preliminary information did not include advice to the effect that the total volume of work would be divided into lots.
Contract notice
Some of the contract notices issued by the audited bodies included CPV codes which deviated from the contents of preliminary information notices or did not accurately specify the work to be done.
In isolated cases, the contract notices published at national level included more information – e.g. concerning performance deadlines – or were published earlier than the notices published in the European Union’s Official Journal.
Ex-ante transparency
The units of one construction administration had commissioned a service company with publishing the national notices.
The latter published the notices on its own procurement platform for the use of which fees are charged.
The construction authorities had however not checked whether this company had complied with the requirement to pass on the notices to the Federal Government’s free internet portal.
Sample audits showed that only one third of the notices had been published on the latter portal.
NKÚ
Contract notice
In case of the construction of a water treatment plant, the contracting authority in its publication of award procedure to suppliers did not indicate the criteria it intended to apply in selecting tenderers.
The contracting authority was not able to prove the way of bid selection.
Reduction of number of bidders was, according to previous legislation, duly in place.
In case of a road circle construction the contracting authority did not specify the figures for evaluation of compliance with qualification criteria and did not indicate the number of bidders to be invited nor in publication of restricted procedure opening neither in the contract award documentation.
The contracting authority evaluated the qualification requirements of all 6 bidders in the restricted procedure as being complied with, but one bidder was excluded because he met the qualification requirements on the last sixth position.
These steps of contracting authority were not transparent, because no information concerning the qualification particulars evaluation and the method of evaluation had ever been published.
Publication of notices
In case of ex-military areas reconstructions, the contracting authority did not publish the written invitation to tender.
Conclusions and recommendations / summarised findings
The two-stage information procedure with prior information and contract notice is an important instrument for implementing the transparency requirement that applies to EU-wide tendering procedures and thus for enhancing competition and preventing corruption.
By extending the obligation to publish prior information to national tendering procedures in the Czech Republic and by applying this obligation in Germany in cases of open and restricted tendering, both countries have implemented EU requirements and thus increased the transparency of national tendering procedures.
Selection of candidates in case of restricted tendering procedures
In contrast to public tendering procedures, restricted tendering procedures do not permit all potential contractors who are interested in winning the contract to participate in the competition.
Under restricted procedures, the contracting authority must previously select potential contractors that will be asked to submit a tender.
Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention
The EU provisions permit a limitation of the number of candidates in EU-wide restricted tendering procedures.
However, restricted procedure requires at least five candidates to be asked to submit tenders and in the case of negotiated procedures with previous publication of a contract notice at least three potential contractors must be invited.
In any case, the number of invited candidates must be sufficiently large to guarantee genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective and nondiscriminatory and must be published in advance.
The selection of potential contractors to be invited is a stage within the tendering procedure which is highly vulnerable to manipulation, e.g. undue preference being given to certain contractors.
Moreover, the restriction of competition to few contractors may facilitate collusive tendering.
In both case, such practices may considerably deteriorate the result of thetendering procedure to the disadvantage of the contracting authority.
Therefore, the latter, must make special arrangements to prevent manipulations, to ensure that adequate controls are in place and that this stage in the procedure is transparent and plausible.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
The provisions on the selection of candidates are similar in the two countries.
In addition to EU requirements, the contracting authorities are to alternate among the contractors to be invited.
It is also not permitted to restrict competition to contractors domiciled in particular regions.
The contracting authorities have to document and justify the selection of bidders and the course of the selection procedure in the contract award memos.
Differing provisions
In Germany, it is required to invite at least three candidates in the case of restricted tendering and several suitable candidates in the case of awards by negotiated contract.
Except in two specific cases, the new Czech regulations do not allow limiting the number of invited tenderers in case of restricted and negotiated procedure.
In Germany, it is required to observe the crosscheck principle when selecting the candidates.
If, e.g. one staff member has proposed a list of candidates, a senior manager of the construction administration or a commissioned staff member of the contracting authority must as a rule modify this proposal e.g. by deleting one of the candidates from the list and/or by adding a new candidate.
This is to prevent that a single individual can finally determine the circle of candidates participating in the competition.
In the absence of such a requirement, far-reaching collusion among the participants would be possible.
The list of candidates to be invited must be treated confidentially and not generally divulged.
This also applies to self-employed professionals.
In the Czech Republic, no similar provisions on the drawing up and confidential treatment of lists of candidates are in place.
Under the German provisions, self-employed professionals may not determine the candidates to be invited but may make proposals to the contracting authority.
Czech rules do not deal with this issue
Key audit results
BRH
Number of bidders
With few exceptions, the requirement for a minimum number of potential contractors to be asked to submit tenders in case of restricted procedures was complied with.
An analysis of nearly 7,000 tendering procedures for building construction limited to the national level showed that, in the case of Federal Government restricted procedures, the contracting authorities invited on average 6.6 potential contractors and, in the case of negotiated contracts, on average 4.4 potential contractors.
Change of contractors and regional restrictions
Especially where building trades with few contractors were involved, the contracting authorities did not make any changes in the circle of selected contractors.
Above all, contractors already known for their good performance were considered more frequently.
The contracting authorities argued that, in the case of non-public procedures, they were bound to ensure the suitability of the contractors to be asked to submit tenders even before actually asking them.
While there was no evidence for illicit restrictions to bidders located in the region, the circle of bidders in the restricted tendering procedures included a larger portion of regional bidders than was the case in public tendering procedures.
The contracting construction authorities attributed this mainly to the smaller contract volumes in comparison to those of public tenders which made long ways to the site a more significant cost item.
Cross-checking principles, proposals of self-employed professionals
The contract-awarding authorities largely disregarded the provisions on the fundamental change of the list of proposed contractors by an independent person.
They especially argued the shortage of staff resources for processing, time pressure or inadequate knowledge about alternative suitable contractors.
In many cases, the records did not indicate who had proposed the contractors to be asked to submit tenders.
The audit of some samples revealed that the lists of potential bidders had been made by self- employed professionals and had been adopted by the contracting authorities without any changes.
Thus, the contracting authorities did not adequately protect themselves against potential manipulations.
Confidential treatment of lists of potential contractors
In one contracting authority, the lists of the contractors to be asked for tenders were held on a data-processing system to which all staff of that authority had read access.
If there had been any intent to manipulate, the unauthorised divulgation of the names of the envisaged or admitted bidders would have been possible which might have enabled contractors to commit price-fixing.
Documentation
Only in few cases did the documentation of contract award procedures show reasons for the selection of bidders.
NKÚ
Selection of bidders
In case of a road circle the bidders had no information about the items of the qualification to be assesed and in which way.
In case of development and modernization of water ways and ports, notices of tender in restricted procedure did not indicate criteria of reduction of the bidders.
All eight participating bidders complied with the qualification requirements, but the limited number of bidders was thus exceeded.
Thereafter, the committee proceeded on the basis of accidental selection – by drawing, which, at that time, was a legal step.
This way of selection, however, should have been mentioned as one of criteria just in the tender notice.
Summarised findings
Given the high risk of manipulation in the selection of bidders in restricted contract award procedures, both countries have introduced special arrangements to prevent illicit restrictions of competition.
The German rules restrict such opportunities for manipulation by means of the cross-check principle, by keeping lists of bidders confidential and by restricting the authority to make proposals for the selection of bidders to the contracting authorities.
Under the new Czech rules potential manipulative restrictions tend to be prevented mainly by the requirement that the number of bidders in restricted procedures must be unlimited.
However, the audit evidence generated revealed that part of these rules was poorly implemented and that the potential for an abusive restriction of the circle of bidders was not adequately reduced in these cases.
The contract-awarding authorities should completely eliminate the deficiencies pointed out.
Tendering phase
The tendering phase, in which potential contractors may draw up tenders on the basis of the tender documents which they have received, begins with the publication of the contract notice and/or with the invitation of tenders.
Potential tenderers may submit tenders until expiry of the deadline for submission, prescribed by the contracting authority.
Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention
EU law does not impose special requirements for this phase of the tendering procedure.
The contracting authorities have to comply with the national provisions designed to counteract the potential for manipulation that exists during the bidding phase.
Such compliance especially relates to organiational arrangements and controls.
Provision of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
As a matter of principle, the tender documents on the basis of which the potential contractors are to work out their bids must always be sent out by the contracting authority.
Private independent professionals involved in the tendering procedure may not perform this task.
The contracting authority has to make sure, that all candidates receive the same information during the tendering phase.
In case of ambiguities in the tender documents or where other questions arise, only the contracting authority may furnish information to the candidates.
The independent professionals commissioned to draw up the tender documents may not provide any information.
During the entire tendering phase, any direct contact between the commissioned independent professionals and the candidates must be prevented.
The firms are not to become a turntable of the contract awarding procedure which enables contacts to be made that adversely affect competition.
Tenders forwarded by post or directly have to be submitted in a closed envelope.
Tenders communicated electronically must be technically encoded.
Differing provisions
In Germany, the contracting authority may commission external service providers to print and send out the tender documents, whose staff must be made to pledge to keep the bids secret and to perform contractual obligations with due care.
In Germany, the tenders received must be marked with a date of receipt stamp and directly and immediately forwarded unopened to a public servant who is responsible for keeping them in custody.
This public servant must not be involved in the tendering procedure.
The tenders received must be kept under lock and key until the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, the tenders received are marked with a file number.
The contracting authority draws up a memo with the tender data including contract numbers and information about the drawing up and receipt.
There are no detailed provisions about the custody of the tenders.
Key audit findings
BRH
BRH audits of the tendering phase focused on the contract award procedures of one building construction administration.
Posting of contract documents
The contract awarding authorities of the building construction administration audited either posted the tender documents themselves or had them printed and posted by an external service company.
Self-employed professionals did not post any tender documents.
Information furnished to bidders
In its designation of the contacts for making queries and obtaining information, the audited building construction administration largely did not comply with the rules for separating planning from the contract award procedure.
Contrary to applicable provisions, it often did not name staff of the contract awarding authority as contact in the specifications but rather staff from the project management units.
Some contract award notifications even included the names of the firms of self-employed professionals who had drawn up the tender documents.
There were isolated cases in which bidders who made inquiries during the bidding stage did not receive identical information.
Marking of tenders
In the construction administration audited, all tenders received were marked with a received stamp and a receipt note.
In the case of some negotiated procedures, however, the tenders were received by self-employed professionals, a practice which prevention rules. infringed the corruption
Úschova nabídek
Ne všechny nabídky byly poslány přímo a bez zpoždění k oficiálnímu uložení, aby byly uzamčeny v ocelové schránce.
In one construction authority, the tenders were temporarily placed in an open pigeonhole of the post room to which each staff member had access.
Another authority had placed a letter-box in a corridor not under constant surveillance and the tenders thrown into this box partly remained there over night.
Since the slot of that letter-box was large and unsecured, not only staff of the authority would have been able to retrieve and manipulate tenders received.
NKÚ
No shortcomings found out in the Czech Republic.
Summarised findings
Provisions are in place in both countries which are to prevent contacts especially between interested enterprises and independent professionals involved in the contract award procedure during the tendering stage.
Equal treatment is to be ensured by furnishing the same information to all bidders.
The rules for the reception, custody and secrecy of the tenders appear suitable for counteracting manipulation and corruption.
In Germany, the relevant requirements are somewhat more comprehensive than in the Czech Republic.
The audit evidence generated in Germany has highlighted infringements of the rules in some areas.
These deficiencies could be remedied with a small input of resources.
Opening of the envelopes
Opening of envelopes
During the bid-opening session, the bids that so far have remained closed will be opened and their contents will be read out and published.
The period during which the bidder is bound by his tender begins at a moment of bidders´ submission date expiry, eventually at the moment of envelopes opening, and ends by deadline set by contracting authority.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
EU law does not include any specific provisions about the opening of envelopes.
However, national laws and regulations comprise extensive requirements for the protection of the bids and of the competition during this highly sensitive phase of the contract award procedure.
The crosscheck principle and the transparency and traceability of the opening of envelopes are to prevent manipulations and modifications of the tenders submitted.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
The bid-opening session must be conducted by several persons to be designated by the contracting authority.
Compliance with the crosscheck principle is to prevent that individuals can manipulate bids without this being noticed.
In both countries, the bidders may in majority of cases attend opening session.
The envelopes when being opened, must have been lain in front of the leader of the proceedings when the first bid was opened.
Bids that have been received late may never be considered.
In order to ensure the transparency of the opening session, the actions taken and the results of bid-opening are to be recorded and the record, among other information, must contain the names of the bidders and the prices quoted.
The minutes must be read out and must be signed by the leader of the proceedings.
The bidders present may also sign the minutes.
Differing provisions
In the Czech Republic, a committee is in charge of the opening of bids.
The participation of independent professionals is permitted.
The Committee may be tasked with conducting subsequent phases of the contract award procedure, e.g. the evaluation of bids.
In Germany, the opening of bids is conducted by a leader of proceedings and a keeper of the minutes.
The leader of proceedings must be a staff member of a contracting authority.
The leader of proceedings and – in the case of building construction – the keeper of the minutes are not to be involved in drawing up the tender documents, in awarding the contract and in contract management.
The German provisions demand that the minutes of the opening session include not only the prices quoted by bidders but also any information about discounts and rebates and extraordinary features e.g. bids received that were damaged or arrived late.
In the Czech Republic, the minutes of the opening session put on record – apart from the prices quoted by bidders – the language of the bid and the applicant’s authority to sign it.
The German provisions require that all parts of the opened bids must be marked so as to prevent any subsequent modifications and amendments.
The bids, which are usually marked by perforation with the date of the opening session, must be kept secret after the opening session and may be made accessible only to the persons commissioned with processing them.
There are no similar Czech provisions.
If only one bid is received in any contract award procedure in the Czech Republic, the bid may not be opened and is to be returned without any evaluation.
In Germany, no similar provision exists. If only one bid is received, it has to be opened and subsequently evaluated.
Basic audit findings
BRH
Cross-checking principle
During the bid-opening sessions, the contracting authorities audited complied with the crosschecking requirement.
They conducted the bidopening sessions always with a session leader and a minute writer to whom no other tenderrelated tasks had been assigned.
In isolated cases of smaller negotiated contracts, however, self-employed professionals opened tenders sent to them, without involvement of the contracting authority.
Minutes
The minutes of the bid-opening sessions did not always completely document the opening of bids.
In some cases, the bids that had been submitted late were not included and in some cases, even signatures were missing.
Marking of bids
The contracting authorities examined in the course of the horizontal audit marked the bids by perforation with the date of the bid-opening session, thereby complying with the requirements.
Audits of grant recipients conducted in the past, had revealed inadequate marking.
These contracting authorities changed their marking practice in response to the BRH’s objection.
NKÚ
Time limit for the receipt of tenders
In case of contracts awarded for road repairs, one bid was received by the contracting authority only one month after expiry of the time limit for the submission of tenders. The contracting authority nevertheless admitted this bid.
Summarised findings
The rules in place in the two countries for opening the envelopes are largely identical. They take into account both the cross-check principle and the principle of transparency which permits a significant restriction of the risks of corruption and manipulation.
The German rules are more comprehensive than those of the Czech Republic.
Especially the requirements for the precise documentation of the procedure, on the marking, safe custody and secrecy of the tenders substantially restrict subsequent changes of the tenders.
Moreover, the officials responsible for opening the envelopes may not perform any other functions in connection with the contracts to be awarded.
The fact that the audits revealed few contraventions proves that the rules for the opening of envelopes are largely accepted.
Examination and evaluation of tenders
The contracting authority has to examine and evaluate the tenders that have been received by the envelope-opening day.
It has to award the contract to the tender which best meets the award criteria.
Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention
EU law provides for a procedure in several stages:
The first step is to determine the suitability of the tenderers.
These must have a good economic and financial standing and the required professional and technical knowledge or ability.
Economic operators that have been convicted by final sentence for bribery or fraud must always be excluded from the tendering procedure.
The tenders of the tenderers not excluded must be evaluated in terms of arithmetical accuracy, technical feasibility and value for money and on the basis of the previously published contract award criteria.
The contracting authority has to determine the economically most favourable tender. The contracting authority has to examine especially any abnormally low prices offered.
The examination and evaluation stage of the tendering procedure is particularly vulnerable to manipulation.
For instance, tenderers may be excluded without due cause or tenders that not meet the requirements may be kept in the competition.
The result of the evaluation may unduly be influenced by giving preference to a tenderer or putting him at a disadvantage, thereby preventing the determination of the economically most favourable tender.
The contracting authority therefore has to make special arrangements particularly to ensure that the persons commissioned with the examination and evaluation meet the requirements of integrity and technical expertise.
It also has to make sure that the tendering procedure and the decisions taken are transparent and plausible.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
In line with EU requirements, the relevant provisions in both countries call for the examination and evaluation of tenders by successive stages.
The requirements for the proofs of suitability to be submitted by the enterprises, the evaluation criteria for deciding about the award and the weighting of these criteria have been laid down in the contract notices or the tender documents and may not be changed during the tendering procedure.
After checking the suitability of tenderers, the suitability criteria may no longer be applied in the evaluation of the tenders.
Such evaluation has to be made only on the basis of the contract award criteria.
The tenders submitted must first be examined under formal criteria as to whether they are complete and whether they include conspicuous features that suggest an intention to manipulate.
Where tenderers are excluded from the further examination and evaluation of their tenders, they have to be notified of this without delay.
If the evaluation of tenders results in a price that appears inappropriately low, the tenderer must be given the opportunity to comment on this prior to the potential exclusion of his tender.
The reasons for the decisions taken in the process must be documented transparently.
Differing provisions
In Germany, the tenders must be kept secret and only the persons commissioned to process them may have the right of access.
Only the contracting authority may review the tenders and verify their arithmetical accuracy.
This work may be assigned only to staff not involved in the contract award decision or the implementation of the project.
There are no precise regulations as to who may perform the further examination and evaluation tasks.
Where self-employed persons are commissioned to examine and evaluate the tenders, they have to honour the confidentiality of these tenders.
They only may make decision proposals to the contracting authority.
In the Czech Republic awarding committees are set up for checking and evaluating the tenders.
The committees produce an evaluation report with proposals for the contract award.
However, in both countries the ultimate decisions about contract awards are made only by the contracting authorities.
If, in Germany, proofs or declarations required to be presented in connection with the submission of tenders are incomplete, the contracting authority must give bidders the chance to submit the missing documents within six days.
Only if the documents have not yet been received after expiry of this deadline, the bid must be excluded.
In the Czech Republic, the contracting authority may at its own discretion decide whether or not to give bidders the opportunity to supplement missing proofs or declarations.
Unless the bidder presents them he must be excluded.
In Germany, not only the total price of tenders has to be examined but also the unit prices (prices of work segments).
If the price structure of the tender suggests that prices for parts of the work to be done have been estimated excessively low or high, the tenderer must be asked to clarify these issues.
If he does not succeed in doing so and if the contracting authority can prove compensatory pricing, the tender in question must be excluded.
This is to prevent that tenderers calculate their tenders on the basis of the assumption that substantial quantitative changes will be made for certain parts of the work performed, which may lead to significant increases in the cost of work projects.
In the Czech Republic, the overall price is evaluated but not the appropriateness of prices for parts of the work.
Compensatory pricing is no justification for the exclusion of a tender.
In Germany, no contract may be awarded to tenders whose price is inappropriately high or low.
Where one or few tenders differ by 10% or more from the price estimated by the contracting authority or from the other tenders, the tenderers must prove that their tenders have been soundly calculated.
If they are unable to do so, the contracting authority may exclude these tenders.
Once value for money has been examined, tenders in the Czech Republic may be cancelled if only tenders with an excessively low price that cannot be justified have been received.
Where prices of tenders are substantially higher than the one estimated by the contracting authority, this is not a valid reason for refusing to award the contract to that tender (contrary to German procurement law).
If, in Germany, there is a suspicion of behaviour restricting competition, the contracting authority must immediately report to the authority in charge of its technical oversight.
The latter has to decide about the action to be taken and whether it is appropriate to inform the cartel authority (antitrust authority) or the public prosecution service.
The oversight authority has to approve e.g. also where the works contract is worth more than € 50.000 and the contract has not been awarded to the lowest-priced tender, where the award is to be made by negotiated contract or where the tendering procedure is to be cancelled.
Czech rules do not deal with this issue.
Key audit findings
BRH
Examination of suitability and award criteria
Most contract award procedures examined complied with the requirements set.
In the case of some potential contractors recommended by self-employed professionals, the contract awarding authorities did not check the suitability of these companies themselves.
One grant recipient commissioned contractors although the required proofs of suitability were not completely at hand.
In the case of some tendering procedures, there was no sound evidence as to whether the contract awarding authority’s choice had taken into account all published award criteria or whether its contract award decision had been based only on the criterion of price.
Selection of persons involved and secrecy of the tenders
Some of the contracting authorities used the services of unauthorised persons.
For instance, self-employed professionals or staff of the construction offices that were involved in the planning or implementation of a work project performed functions whose discharge was incumbent exclusively on the contract awarding authority.
The construction authorities sought to justify this by inadequate staff resources in the sectors concerned.
In some cases, the self-employed professionals commissioned to examine the tenders used staff that had not been formally obliged to keep the tenders secret and to exercise due care in the fulfilment of their contractual commitments.
Concerning the construction authorities, there usually was no conclusive evidence as to whether the tenders, when in the custody of the self-employed professionals, were accessible only for the persons to which their processing was directly assigned.
Review and arithmetical check of the tenders
Some contracting authorities handed over the opened tenders to self-employed professionals for further examination without having first performed the prescribed review of tenders and arithmetical check and documented the results of these examinations.
In case of any intention to manipulate, third parties could have made changes in the tenders which the contracting authorities would not have been able to identify.
The documents examined revealed a number of cases in which unusual features were not adequately marked or where information about prices and products was missing.
Performance audits
A sample audit in a construction authority revealed that, in 75% of all contract award procedures, the most favourable tenders deviated by more than 10% from the estimates made beforehand.
One in twenty contract award procedures was cancelled owing to inappropriate tender prices.
In a number of cases, there was a lack of evidence or sufficient documentation about examinations of tenders or discussions with tenderers held to clarify questions.
In many cases, detailed information was missing, e.g. concerning unit prices of the most important items in the invoices.
Factors such as changed market prices or increases of material costs were frequently given as reasons for the deviations.
The construction authorities stated that identifying and proving compensatory pricing was difficult.
In the case of one invitation to tender issued by a non-departmental body, the lowest price quoted in a tender was 66% lower than the previous estimate of the contract value.
Closer examinations of costing or investigations to identify the causes of this deviation were not on record.
In a discussion to clarify the question, the contract awarding authority did not find any evidence as to price dumping by the tenderer to whom the contract was eventually awarded.
Thus, it remained unclear whether the previous estimate was excessive or the tender price was too low.
Later, the contract awarding authority classified the contractor as “low-cost company” which was neither able to meet the quality requirements nor the deadlines.
In another tendering procedure, the construction authority adjudicated the contract to a tender whose price was 35% higher than the original cost estimate.
It did not cancel the tendering procedure, adducing the unfounded argument that the company in question could be expected not to base its pricing on unreasonably high costs.
Suspicion of irregularities
Two cases of irregularities were found in one audited construction authority and reported to the authority responsible for technical supervision.
In one tendering procedure, two bidders submitted identical cost calculations which prompted the construction authority to exclude both tenders.
The audits did not reveal any significant deficiencies in the application of the other provisions.
NKÚ
Verification of the suitability
In many of the construction projects audited such as university buildings, road and railway construction, and others, the contracting authorities did not exclude the bidders from participation in the procedure, even if they did not comply with the requirements of tender documentation or they did not prove their qualification in the extent prescribed. On the other hand, one contracting authority could neither prove nor explain the reason of excluding a bidder who complied with the requirements.
Evaluation
When awarding a contract for the construction of a water treatment plant the contracting authority did not base its examination and evaluation on the defined evaluation criteria.
In case of rail road construction, the contracting authority determined the weight of evaluation criteria as late as in the beginning of evaluation.
In case of road repairs, the defined criterion of “construction period shortening” was evaluated inappropriately.
As a result, the shortening offered by the bidders that were second and third in the competition was not adequately taken into account.
Documentation of the reasons why a bidder was selected
In three contract award procedures for the support of housing, the contracting authority did not document what criteria were used in the course of evaluation and what was the way of selection of successful bidder.
When awarding small scale contracts worth up to €20 000 in connection with a motorway construction, the contracting authority selected the bidders only on the basis of telephone consultations concerning the prices and terms of deliveries.
It was impossible to audit these selections, because these consultations were not documented.
Summarised findings
In both countries, the rules for examining and evaluating the tenders comply with EU requirements.
However, they differ with respect to detailed steps of the procedure and the selection of the individuals involved.
In Germany, the steps of the procedure are governed by stricter and more detailed requirements, especially concerning the implementation of the cross-check principle and the protection of bids than in the Czech Republic.
The same applies to the rules for verifying the appropriateness of the prices quoted.
In both countries it was found that in some of the cases audited essential steps of the procedure for examining and evaluating the tenders were not documented at all or, if they were, only incompletely.
However, the lack of an audit trail and of transparency in respect of the decisions taken during examination and evaluation facilitates manipulations.
A particularly grave deficiency was the handing over of tenders to third parties without prior appropriate examination and documentation of the tenders by the contract-awarding authority which would have prevented any manipulations.
Where contract-awarding authorities commission third parties to perform functions in connection with the examination and evaluation of tenders, appropriate arrangements and enhanced control are necessary to counteract the increased risk of manipulation.
When auditing the appropriateness of prices, the audited administrative entities in Germany did not always make use of the complete range of tools available and thus inadequately explored the price structure.
In the Czech Republic, the audit revealed irregularities especially in connection with the examination of suitability and the application of the evaluation criteria.
Completion of the tendering procedure
Once the tenders have been examined and evaluated, the tendering procedure is completed by awarding the contract or by cancelling the procedure.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
In case of EU-wide tendering procedures, all tenderers must be notified in advance of the contract award decision taken.
The contractors have the opportunity to examine the intended decision within a period of 10 or 15 days and to seek a review where appropriate.
No contract may be concluded before expiry of this period.
If forwarded electronically or per fax, the limitation period is 10 days. If other means of communication are used, it is 15 days.
If a bidder applies for review within the notification period, a contract may be concluded only after the final decision taken in the review procedure.
Moreover, the enterprises may refer the award decision made under this procedure to an independent court of law for further review.
The review is to ensure both legal protection given to the contractors and compliance with procurement law by the contracting authority.
The contracting authority must adequately document the tendering procedure.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
Both countries have implemented the EU provisions about the information and review procedure.
In both countries, the decision about awarding the contract lies with the contracting authority.
The latter may however not arbitrarily deviate from the result of a duly conducted examination and evaluation.
The contracting authority is to award the contract within the announced examination period.
The reason is the fact that the bidders are no longer bound by their tenders once this period has expired.
In open and restricted procedures and public or restricted invitations to tender, the contracting authority may not stipulate a content of the contract which deviates from that of the tender.
The unsuccessful bidders are to be notified on a timely basis of the award decision made and the reasons why their respective bids have not been accepted.
The cancellation of tendering procedures is admissible only if certain conditions are met, e.g. if the prices quoted in the tenders are excessivesind or the tenders do not conform to the specifications.
Differing provisions
In the Czech Republic, the 10 or 15 days obligatory information and waiting period before awarding the contract also applies to work contracts that do not require Europe-wide tendering.
In Germany, the equivalent provision only applies to EU-wide tendering procedures.
In all other tendering procedures in Germany, the tenderers my not be informed about the contract award until the award decision has been taken.
In the Czech Republic, a tendering procedure must be cancelled, if only one tender has been received or only one tender met the requirements for being considered and evaluated.
In Germany, the contract must also be awarded, if only one single tender has been received, provided that this tender meets the conditions set forth in the tender documents and is cost-effective.
Key audit findings
BRH
Only few deficiencies in the completion of the tendering procedures audited were found.
In some cases of EU-wide tendering, companies received commissioning letters before expiry of the notification period, which may render the contract void.
Also, in some cases of open procedures, commissioning letters included modifications incompatible with the contents of the tender, e.g. new deadlines.
In several cases, the contracting authorities did not comply with the deadlines for awarding the contracts.
In case of an open procedure, the contracting authority commissioned the second most favourable bidder, because a bidder whose tender price was more than 50 % lower was no longer willing to perform the contract at the price originally quoted.
NKÚ
In case of a construction project in the field of higher education, the contracting authority did not conclude the contract with the bidder in correspondence to the contract proposal indicated in the bid of selected supplier.
In some contract award cases, such as repair and maintenance of the roads, construction of a motorway and of road circle, the contracting authorities concluded the contracts later than prescribed by law.
In case of contracts awarded in the context of exmilitary areas reconstructions, contracting authority dispatched the information of selected bid to all bidders only after expiration of legal deadline.
Summarised findings
Both countries have implemented the EU provisions about the completion of tendering procedures.
The legal protection of unsuccessful bidders contributes to reducing corruption.
Within Czech procurement law, the purview of legal protection also encompasses awards falling below EU thresholds.
In both countries, it was found that the limitation period for awarding contracts had been exceeded.
This may result in adverse economic consequences and increase the risk of manipulation.
In future, the construction authorities should eliminate such shortcomings in completing tender procedures.
Documentation, notification and reporting duties
During the successive steps of the contractaward procedures, relevant findings and decisions and their underlying reasons must be documented in a transparent way.
In case of EUwide procedure, contract awards are to be publicly announced.
The data on the contract awards are also included in EU statistics.
Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention
The obligation to document contract-award procedures complies with a basic requirement of the transparency principle that applies EU-wide.
Only a careful and timely documentation ensures transparency as to the contract-award decisions and the reasons underlying them. In particular, it ensures the effective legal protection of bidders’ interests in cases where the contract value exceeds the EU thresholds.
Due documentation is also an essential ingredient to corruption prevention since the obligation to give detailed justifications for contract-award decisions significantly reduces the scope for manipulation.
In the case of EU-wide contract-award procedures, the contracting authorities have to notify all awards made under EU-wide contractaward procedures to the EU’s Office of Official Publications not later than 48 days after the contract award date.
The Office publishes the notifications in the EU’s Official Journal and thus also honours the transparency requirement.
The contracting authorities must collect the essential data on their contract-award procedures and report them to the EU Commission via the relevant national ministries.
On this basis, the EU Commission produces annual statistics which enable it to obtain an overview of the development of the Single Market in the field of construction works.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
Both countries have completely transposed into national law the provisions of EU law concerning documentation and notification.
The provisions on documentation and notification for the purpose of EU statistics are largely identical in both countries.
Differing provisions
In the Czech Republic, the duty to publish contract awards does not only apply to EU-wide procurements but also to national contract-award procedures.
The deadline for notification is only 15 days.
In Germany, public announcement duties apart from those imposed by EU law apply only to restricted tendering exceeding a threshold of €25,000 and discretionary awarding of contracts (negotiated contracts) exceeding a threshold of €15,000 VAT excluded (so-called ex-post transparency).
Below these thresholds and in the case of public tenders, only the participating enterprises are given information about the contract awards.
Basic audit findings
BRH
Documentation
A large number of the tendering procedures audited were not documented completly.
The contract award notices did not include all necessary information about e.g. reasons for product specifications and national regulations.
In the case of one tendering procedure, the contracting authority did not give any reason why it had awarded the contract to a bidder whose tender did not include obligatory proofs.
In a few cases, documentation of the contracting authorities did not include all records required for documenting the tendering procedure.
Publication of contract awards
In the case of some EU-wide tendering procedures, the contracting authorities failed to publish the contract award notices.
In the case of several tendering procedures, the proofs for the publication of contract award notices by the contracting authorities were missing.
Reporting duties
The statistical compilations reviewed included the required minimum information and had been produced and posted on a timely basis.
Ex-post transparency
In most cases, the construction administrations audited published the contract data of the completed tendering procedure.
In the case of one construction administration, however, these data were not published due to a communication error.
It took the construction administration half a year to notice the mistake.
As a result, contract data of the tendering procedures completed during that period were not published.
NKÚ
Documentation
In case of construction work connected with a large sports event considerable shortcomings in documentation in course of procurement procedure were found out, which concerned mainly incorrect data e.g. in evaluation committee records concerning the bid prices.
In adition, some of the minutes about the opening of envelopes were not signed.
Publication of contract awards
In case of repairs and maintenance of road construction projects, announcements of contracts awarded were distributed after the deadline, resp. they were not published.
Summarised findings
The provisions on documentation, reporting and notification implement the EU requirements and are largely identical in both countries.
This generally ensures the transparency of contract-award procedures and award decisions.
The Czech publication requirements are somewhat stricter than their German counterparts.
The examination revealed shortcomings substantially reducing the value of documentation and publication as a means of corruption prevention.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The construction authorities should further enhance the transparency of their contract award procedures and should fully meet reporting and notification requirements.
Summarised evaluation and recommendations
The parallel audits of the NKU and the BRH focused on two issues which are essential both in the Czech Republic and in Germany for the awarding of public works contracts: the application of EU procurement law and the prevention of corruption.
The provisions of EU law provide the opportunity for international competition within the EU in order to create a European Single Market.
Measures designed to prevent corruption do not only aim at avoiding or at least reducing corruption. They are also to prevent financial damage and potential loss of confidence in the integrity of government.
The audit findings generated by the two SAIs with respect to the application of procurement law in both countries and the comparison of the respective provisions of procurement law provide an insight into the common and differing features that may be helpful for both countries in further developing their procurement law and its application.
Application of EU procurement law
Both countries have transposed into national law the EU legislation concerning the awarding of public works contracts.
Thus, an important common basis exists in both countries for the awarding of public works contracts and the compliance with the essential requirements in this field: competition; equal treatment of the participating enterprises and transparency of the contract award procedure.
The construction administrations of both countries have underpinned these requirements by partly very extensive administrative regulations.
The Czech Republic has largely adopted the provisions on public works contracts requiring EU-wide tendering for those contract award procedures that are below the EU threshold and are therefore governed by national law.
However, the SAIs‘ audits revealed that the construction administrations did not always fully comply with all relevant provisions of EU-law.
The construction administration in Germany should continue to improve the quality of its contract award procedures in order to eliminate the deficiencies pointed out with respect to the implementation of EU requirements.
In the Czech Republic, the audits furthermore identified the risks impacting on the value for money achieved in contract award procedures.
For instance, incomplete specification of the public contract subject, resulting in need of extra works, often awarded in contradiction to the law. Furthermore, insufficient specification of the expected price was provided. Also, qualification requirements limited the possible number of bidders, thus restricting competition, namely in the area of transport constructions.
Corruption prevention
Our audits did not aim at detecting cases of corruption.
One of the reasons was that the SAIs do not have the necessary tools at their disposal.
However, the SAIs can check whether the administrations of the two countries have adopted measures to curb corruption and manipulation in connection with awards of public works contracts and how these measures are applied.
In respect of corruption prevention, the two countries have focused on different aspects.
The German provisions mainly provide for largely unrestricted competition, transparency and checks as central elements of corruption prevention.
The Czech provisions mainly aim at increasing the transparency of the procedures.
BRH
In Germany, general principles of corruption prevention are in place that apply to the entire federal administration.
These principles have also been implemented in the requirements for awarding public works contracts and have been adapted to meet the special needs of such contract awards.
The relevant provisions specify, partly with great precision, the ways in which the requirements of corruption prevention need to be met in the course of the contract award procedure and the selection of the persons involved in them.
In the BRH’s opinion, especially the principle that preference must be given to open procedures or public invitations to tender is a suitable tool for substantially reducing the risk of corruption in connection with the awarding of public works contracts, while restrictions of competition increase the risk of manipulation.
Risk analyses and adequate controls (especially the cross-check principle), the requirements concerning transparency, the documentation of contract award procedures and various organisational measures are also effective mechanisms to prevent corruption and manipulation.
We therefore do not perceive any need for fundamental changes of the respective provisions public entities have to comply with when awarding public works contracts.
The provisions on corruption prevention are largely implemented in practice.
The deficiencies found in some areas have highlighted weaknesses in complying with some requirements.
Therefore, the construction administrations should offer further training to their staff to enhance their familiarity with the requirements for corruption prevention and further increase their awareness of this issue.
An essential part of the weaknesses highlighted referred to tasks which the construction administrations had delegated to self-employed professionals.
However, in the absence of adequate checks and controls, the delegation of tasks increases the risk of abuse.
Tasks vulnerable to manipulation and corruption should therefore only be assigned to third parties, if the administration can guarantee a sufficient degree of protection against undue interference.
NKÚ
The Czech Republic adopted on governmental level the anti-corruption strategies which focus on public procurement.
Essential amendments of the Act on public contracts award and connecting implementation rules were made.
The NKÚ audits were carried out in the period of realization of this strategy.
The adopted strategy and new legal provisions may represent the efficient measures for improvement, whereas the contracting authorities have to justify effectiveness of public contracts, calculation of expected prices, adequacy of qualification requirements, definition of the basic evaluation criteria and the way of bid evaluation, and all that must be duly documented and published.
Recommendations
On the whole, the NKU and BRH have a favourable opinion about the way the EU requirements are implemented.
The fact that they are largely accepted in practice has confirmed that the EU requirements of competition, equal treatment and transparency are a suitable basis for awarding public works contracts within the European Union.
The supranational model implemented in the European Union may also serve as a basis for similar projects designed to facilitate and encourage international competition.
In view of the enormous potential for material and ideal damage from manipulation and corruption in connection with the awarding of public works projects, both SAIs hold that it is the duty of the construction administrations to continue their measures against corruption and manipulation and, where possible, to improve them.
In particular, the organisational structures and processes of the contract award procedures should be monitored continuously for weaknesses and risks in order to identify and respond to any need for corrective action.
Comparison of the Czech and the German practice indicates that the volume of open procedures offering the large space for competition and substantially decreasing the chances of corruption acts should be enforced in the Czech Republic.
Also, an increased segmentation of construction work into lots may positively impact on achieved price, if it results in more competition due to a higher number of bidders.
Ensuring the correct implementation of contract award procedures is an essential basis for efficient public sector procurement.
In Germany, the procedures are organized by special state institutions, while in the Czech Republic, except of the transport constructions, they are organized by central institutions themselves or by their contractual entities.
The SAIs of both countries wish to further develop the findings relevant to their work and, where appropriate, to raise the related issues with their respective Parliament and Government even beyond the completion of their joint project.
Furthermore, both SAIs are convinced that the principles of procurement law and their implementation described in this report are also matters of interest at the level of the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), since the principles and findings expounded are of general importance for effectively curbing corruption and for ensuring that public works contracts are awarded under a regime of well-functioning and fair competition and that good value for money is obtained.

Thyssenkrupp supervisory board votes for group restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board unanimously voted in favor of the plans for the reorganization of the Group.
According to the wishes of Thyssenkrupp interim head, Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed to the meeting on Sunday for the management board, the crisis-hit group will be split into two independent companies.
Both companies will have their registered office in Essen and will be listed on the stock exchange.
There will be no further downsizing in addition to the reductions already known about.
After two withdrawals, the supervisory body only has eight heads on the capital side.
And there are ten employee representatives.
The final decision will be made in a general meeting planned in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to hold a 50-percent share from the merged steel business with Indian partner Tata.
The second company, Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, is to be bundled with the elevator and subcontracting business.

Barcelona: Police brutality and violent Catalan independence activists at demonstrations.
Violent clashes by Spanish policemen and Catalan independence activists in Barcelona with numerous casualties at two concurrent demonstrations.
According to the city administration, about 3000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as about 6000 independence activists demonstrated.
The Catalan police tried to keep the two protesting groups away from each other.
According to deployment forces, advocates for independence again tried to break through the security barrier.
They attacked the officers with paint and thrown objects.
Brawls between the participants of the two protesting groups were also reported.
24 people were injured according to the rescue forces.
The police stated there have been six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
The police had wanted to pay tribute to their colleagues who had opposed the independence referendum in Catalonia banned almost exactly a year ago by the Spanish central government.
They demanded better salaries at the same time.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil thought it was unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers were earning much more than they were.
The demonstrators found it provocative that the Spanish police demonstrated in Barcelona of all places.
Why did they come here to protest? The 55-year old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez asked the news agency AFP.
Simply to provoke and to celebrate the fact that they worked us over a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who said his name is Daniel, rejected the accusation.
Of course we want to support our comrades who were only doing their job a year ago: defending the law, he said.
But the demonstration is here to enforce our rights and we're doing it in Barcelona, because it is a major European city and there is more echo here.
However, he and his colleagues did “not come here to provoke,” the policeman ensured us.

Football: Juventus trainer applauds the top game: Ronaldo’s best game
The Portuguese star striker ‘this evening played the best game in addition to Valencia’s half hour’, commended Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against SSC Napoli.
For the coach, the expensively purchased star without scoring himself was the decisive man of the match in the important game against the pursuers.
Ronaldo had a lot of fun and did it well, said Allegri.
Even if we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good with our first goal and we just got better from then onwards.
Thanks to Ronaldo’s three assists, Juve struck back in the game after being down early through the goal by Dries Mertens (10th Minute) and in the thick of things the pursuer was put off for the time being.
The goal-getter brought in from Madrid first tackled the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who provided a double score (26./49.) for the lead.
And Ronaldo provided the build-up with a head ball from a corner shot, for the goal by the defence leader Leonardo Bonucci (76), who just had to make a short push in, in front of the goal line.
He gives a lot, said the trainer.
But naturally Allegri will also see goals from the attacker, who is the record goal scorer in both the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team.
We have to get better at serving him, the coach said.
Currently Mandzukic is the best Juve scorer with four goals - Ronaldo has three.
The superiority of Juventus seems even more overwhelming, with the purchase of Ronaldo, for more than 100 million Euros.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in Series A. With 21 points the masters over the past seven years already have a six-point lead over Napoli.
The second team in the table, coached by the former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without chances against Turin.
The top match was however decided at the latest after the dismissal of the already warned Mario Rui (58.).
The Portuguese after a too strong pile in against Paulo Dybala had to leave the field with a yellow-red.
We played well against a good Napoli, the Turin coach commented.
Emre Can should also feel addressed.
The German national has asserted himself at Juve.
The professional, who came from Liverpool, participated in all seven league matches.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League game against Valencia, which is what Allegri meant by the ‘half hour’: Ronaldo was sent off at the 2:0 Turin win and is barred for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.

Kanye West changes his name
On the weekend, with a particularly bizarre appearance, rapper Kanye West attracted attention on the US TV show "Saturday Night Live".
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused raised eyebrows and questions among the spectators.
On time for the release of his new album, the 41 year old additionally announced a name change.
From now on, one may call him only "Ye", so the musician.
The artist, formerly known as Kanye West, twittered in the style of the dead singer Prince, when he changed his stage name.
However, the pseudonym is not news.
The tenth album has appeared under this name.
In an interview with radio station KRRL the artist explains that ‘Ye’ has a religious significance for him.
I think ‘Ye’ is the most frequently used word in the bible and means ‘you’, the rapper said.

Football: District League A1 Münster: Finally!
Done!
Hoetmar’s trainer Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game by us today.
The opponent was just easier to grip, we have almost never faced problems." Accordingly thin reads the list of Hoetmarer bullet options.
Just two scoring chances in 90 minutes. Not a good chance for a positive outcome.
Football District League A1: SC Hoetmar and SG Sendenhorst played 0-2 (0-1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG had only two options in the first round, but Maik Krause used the first from an acute angle to secure the early lead (7).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen Uphus could have upped the score, but after great preparation work by Krause he missed the ball.
The hosts had only a double opportunity as Moritz Höne failed and Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorst keeper Jos Schuhmacher.
After halftime, the guests were even more dominant and had a number of good opportunities.
But Uphus (minute 49), Julian Turl (minute 61) and Heinz Linnemann (minute 69) all failed.
A hand penalty - Louis Kortenjann had rescued on the goal line with the hand and got the red card - was also not of use for the guests (minute 75).
Only once Nils Berheide poked the ball across the line was the game over (81st minute).
We had previously criticized ourselves hard, that was different today than in the last few weeks, was Florian Kraus’ conclusion.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th minute Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th minute (Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0-1 Krause (minute 7), 0-2 Berheide (minute 81).
Red card: Kortenjann (minute 75/Hoetmar).

Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacular football in Albachten: GW Albersloh falls against Concordia 3-4
I do not know what to think of that, he struggled for words.
We did not get any access to them. With ‘them’, he allegedly meant the wing players Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably also all the other green and whites, who made themselves noticeable with their collective offensive urge.
He could still laugh: "A filthy win," he said, winking cheekily and then went off. His players, on the other hand, were relieved to have gotten away with three points.
Mind you, after a duel between two teams, one of which, Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting for staying in the league.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes.
That was by far our best performance of the season, he says.
It was phenomenal how we come back from the 0-2 draw and held up against one of the league's top teams over the entire match.
Hence, the more bitter it seems, that they had to go home empty-handed.
Top scorer Lars Zymner shot his team in the lead with his 12th. Goal this season (minute 24).
He needed exactly two touches in this game for this goal.
The 2-0, he set for Fabian Fröhning (minute 39).
We knew it, but you just can't completely take out a player like that.
It was amazing what he did, Lewandowski ungrudingly recognized the opponent’s quality.
Just before switching sides, his own team managed to score the equalizer: McGill’s free kick from the left side sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long goal corner (45th minute).
After switching sides, it was McGill again who scored the equalizer (59th minute).
And then it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten (minute 64), just five minutes later Patrick Horstmann equalized again (minute 69).
Despite their numerical advantage, Albersloh was unable to counter the last Concordia goal (minute 80).
Now, we must focus on Wednesday.
The game against Schapdetten, that’s one we have to win now, said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th minute Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th minute Bareksai).
Goals: 1-0 Zymner (minute 24), 2-0 Fröhning (minute 39), 2-1 McGill (minute 45), 2-2 McGill (minute 59), 3-2 Nübel (minute 64), 3-3 P. Horstmann (minute 69), 4-3 Jülkenbeck (minute 80).
Indirect Red: Atalan (minute 74/Albachten).

Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of pageantry
Good that he’s gone again.
There are only a few state guests whose departure creates as great a sense of relief in Germany as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Turkish President was a guest in Berlin and Cologne for three days and many thought he should never have been invited.

Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
Until the middle of the following year the Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 meetings.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has shown interest to personally claim the tolerance prize in Tutzing.
The term of office was too short for Christian Wulff: As Federal President he was not in Tutzing’s Evangelical Academy.
But before and after Wulff has been as a guest there.
This is how Academy Director Udo Hahn counted him in when he proudly said: "All Federal Presidents and Federal Chancellors have visited us". That celebrities appear again and again at the academy in Tutzing Castle was also an issue in the presentation of the annual program.
At the end of October, songwriter, Konstantin Wecker took part in a session about spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective, on September 29, the writer Frido Mann will be at a session about his Grandfather Thomas Mann.
France’s President Emmanuel has also confirmed: He wants to accept the “Prize for Tolerance” awarded to him by the academy in Tutzing in person, the TV presenter Dunja Hayali is also receiving something in another category (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings until mid-2019 are with essence.
The pension is not even safe! says a conference title.
SOS at Europe’s borders - this is how the Academy describes the ‘risky and fatal route across the Mediterranean’.
And a conference about Syria: Barbarism without limit’.
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - the war makes a mockery of the humane’.
The spectrum of events extends from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor as well as to the radical change of work through digitisation.
Academy Director, Hahn was not convinced: ‘A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together, to look for solutions or at least partial solutions’.
Soon at a conference celebrating the 200th
birthday of Karl Marx, some will be awaiting more visitors in the direction of criticism of capitalism, while others more likely a tendency "from left to centre".
What about neutrality?
We are 100 percent a subsidiary of the evangelical national church, said Director of Studies, Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, ‘but we are not 100 percent neutral’.

Satirical revue: Gender communication from the heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
Tina Teubner’s satirical revue Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck was "suitable for adults as well as men".
Comedian Teubner honed in on gender communication with humor and empathy for the (stereotypical) woman and the (stereotypical) man - and anything else that out there - but also with music.
They played mini guitar and also mastered their violins.
Ben Süverkrüp was manning the piano.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes even gets a word in before the end of the sentence, and on the other, a true pianist: Süverkrüp accompanied Teubner congenially and in harmony, so much so that some may have wished a solo.
Then there was this, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, so as to fit the theme of the evening.
Teubner had introduced a paradox: She mused that a man is happy when he has a partner but does not hold the door open for her.
But that a closed door without a partner, on the other hand, offers no benefit.
The piano solo demonstrated this very notion: How would Mozart’s career as a composer turned out, if his older sister "the Nannerl" had suddenly opened the door?
Thus Süverkrüp slides into improvisations, from Bach’s "O Head full of blood and wounds" into the "Death Rattle" Western theme, and from Mozart’s G minor Symphony into a playful little dance.
There was great applause and shouts of "bravo" from the packed hall.
The association’s treasurer, Karlheinz Kleintje, presented flowers to the singer.
But chairwoman Heidemarie Markenbeck refused to part without offering additional thanks.
She had the idea to treat the duo to a gig in Wolbeck in addition to their appearances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

Musk also agreed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to pay a double-digit penalty in the millions, according to the SEC.
The background is Musk's surprise announcement in August to take Tesla off the stock exchange.
The SEC accused Musk of publishing false and misleading information.

Administration of Value Added Tax in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Follow-up Audit Report
Foreword
Taxes in general constitute the key source of public revenues.
It therefore goes without saying that Supreme Audit Institutions (hereinafter “SAIs”) should place focus on that audit area.
Value added tax (hereinafter “VAT”) fraud is an example.
It causes an estimated loss of some EUR 100 billion in the European Union (hereinafter “EU”) each year.
Already in 2005 during the VI. EUROSAI Congress in Bonn the participants outlined the need for working together very closely.
In so doing the SAIs would be able to share audit approaches etc. and find out best practices.
VAT is an audit area which is very suitable for tax audit cooperation because it is the only tax harmonised within the EU.
The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (hereinafter “Czech SAI”) and the Federal Court of Auditors - Bundesrechnungshof (hereinafter “German SAI”) conducted a first ever parallel audit in the field of VAT in 2006.
The report was published in 2008.
As it is known that VAT fraud is a phenomenon not limited to a single country but spread throughout the EU close cooperation amongst the SAIs is needed to ensure comprehensive evaluation of the steps taken to address this problem.
The two SAIs decided therefore to pursue their cooperative efforts in this field and conducted a second parallel audit.
1. Introduction
Audit number: (CZ) 09/11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892
Subject of audit: (CZ) Administration of value added tax (D) Bilateral audit with the NKÚ (follow-up audit)
Objective of audit:
(CZ) The audit objective was to review the procedure used by financial authorities in administrating VAT and the procedure used to address selected cases of business transactions between the Czech Republic and Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter “Germany”) and to review the procedures used by the tax administrations of the two countries as part of international cooperation.
(D) On the one hand, the audit was designed to evaluate the steps taken by the tax administration to implement the recommendations made by the SAIs.
On the other hand, other fields linked with VAT were to be covered.
The resulting audit findings were to be compared and best practices identified (if any).
The audit period covered the years 2006 through 2008 including relevant information dating from the time preceding the audit up to the time of audit conclusion.
2. Summary of findings and evaluation of parallel audits
The follow-up audit of the administration of VAT in the Czech Republic and in Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two SAIs.
During previous parallel audits, suspicious cases of intra-Community transactions were detected.
Some of them merited further review.
On the basis of audit findings the two SAIs produced recommendations on VAT management.
The follow-up audit was conducted to evaluate the action taken in response to these recommendations and to review the suspicious cases selected.
The audit also covered other topics such as the selected cases of high risk intra-Community transactions, mutual assistance for the recovery of claims and the VAT audit of large tax entities.
When auditing VAT administration in selected areas in the two countries, auditors developed the following audit findings:
1. Recommendations from the previous audit
• Recommendation 1: Conditions for registration of taxpayers should be harmonised within the EU
By comparing the systems of registration for VAT in the two countries auditors found discrepancies in the previous parallel audits.
Since the different ways of registration caused problems, the SAIs recommended harmonising the conditions for registration of taxpayers within the EU.
This issue was taken up at EU level.
The draft of the amended Council (EC) Regulation No. 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No. 218/92 (hereinafter the “Council (EC) Regulation No. 1798/2003”) had proposed to expand the current databases within EU, including a database of the tax identification numbers of the VAT payers.
It also provided for common standards for registration and deregistration of taxpayers.
The SAIs expected Member States to agree on adequate standards supporting their decision to keep unreliable traders as early as possible out of the VAT system.
However, the latest version of this document being subject of political agreement among Member States within ECOFIN does no longer cover those issues mentioned before.
The two SAIs regret, that the idea of common minimum standards has been abandoned.
They still consider this idea relevant to combat VAT fraud preventively.
• Recommendation 2: Monthly submission of recapitulative statements
As part of international cooperation, the previous audit recommended that all Member States introduce the monthly submission of recapitulative statements in order to enable earlier reviewing of the values of intra-Community transactions.
Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common VAT system to combat tax evasion associated with intra-Community transactions has reduced the time limit for submission of recapitulative statements of intra-Community transactions to one month.
In the Czech Republic, this issue was implemented by the amended VAT Act effective as of 1 January 2010, in Germany it was implemented as from 1 July 2010.
Germany had not implemented the obligation for submitting recapitulative statements monthly on schedule, whereas the Czech Republic was in line with applicable EU guidelines.
• Recommendation 3: Matching data of VAT returns and recapitulative statements in Germany to reach a higher reliability of VIES data and considering the merger of the two procedures for VAT returns and recapitulative statements
The German tax administration accepted the recommendation of the German SAI and established a working group to explore possible solutions.
The work is still under way and the German SAI will closely monitor further developments.
• Recommendation 4: Sharing good practice criteria, components or approaches of a risk management system at EU-level In earlier audit work, the two SAIs concurred that an effective risk management system could not be developed by one Member State only.
Good practice criteria, components or approaches of a risk management system have to be shared and implemented in each EU Member State.
If not so, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest risk management system.
We found that the two Member States used differing risk management systems that have its strengths and weaknesses.
In this field, the Czech SAI audited the system of exchange of information within EU - EUROCANET and the German SAI focused on German participation in the “Platform on Risk Management”.
2. Follow-up audit of selected intra-Community transaction cases
During the earlier audit, a joint review was performed on business transactions where doubts existed as to their realisation or discrepancies in the method used by the taxpayers of the two countries to report the business transactions in the VAT returns or recapitulative statements.
The two SAIs selected nine cases for the follow-up audit that included intraCommunity movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany.
Inspections carried out by the tax offices of the respective countries had not been finished at the conclusion of our previous joint audit.
The follow-up audit verified that most of the tax proceedings relating to the selected cases of business transactions between the taxpayers into/from the Czech Republic were concluded and adequate measures were taken by the tax administrations in the Czech Republic or in Germany (i. a. additional VAT assessments or prevention of reimbursement of input tax).
3. Audit of selected cases of high-risk intra-Community transactions
We selected high-risk cases of intra-Community transactions made by EU taxpayers presented in EUROCANET.
The EUROCANET system is a tool for the detection of high-risk taxpayers within EU.
The Member States can participate in the system on a facultative basis.
The Czech Republic is an active participant of EUROCANET, whereas Germany has a passive status.
From the point of view of an active participant, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States are opposed to active participation.
Given the fact that the German tax administration took no part in data exchange in the EUROCANET system, no information could be obtained what suppliers with German VAT ID were assessed as high-risk cases.
The Czech SAI found that cases including normal business transactions were identified during the audit as well as cases of suspected involvement in carousel trading and fraudulent activities related to VAT.
The tax administrators have limited possibilities for inspecting high-risk transactions, concerning in particular “missing traders”, while a physical review of the documents alone can hardly serve to prove any fraudulent activity to the tax entity.
The same applies to tax administrators, when import from and export to third countries are additionally combined with intra-Community carousel trading.
In these cases, it would be recommendable to provide for increased mutual cooperation between the customs and tax authorities aimed at identifying goods and irregularities with transportation documents as well as monitoring their physical movements within the EU in direction to the final consumer.
Germany as well as a number of other countries were reluctant to actively join the EUROCANET system due to the nonexistence of a sufficient legal basis.
In Germany, other tools for the detection of risk taxpayers are used that have proven to be suitable for the German tax administration so far.
In this area, there is a need for communication and sharing experiences among all EU Member States.
The EU Council reached political agreement on the draft regulation, which recasts Council (EC) Regulation No. 1798/2003.
Its main innovation is the creation of EUROFISC.
The experiences gathered so far with EUROCANET should become part of the envisaged network for fighting against VAT fraud.
4. Mutual assistance for the recovery of claims
In the area of international assistance for the recovery of claims all EU Member States are governed by the same European legislative arrangements.
Therefore the handling of requests for international assistance for the recovery of claims is the same in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The German and the Czech SAI compared the statistics that the two Member States had sent to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.
The statistics contained inconsistencies.
The SAIs considered it useful to discuss again the statistics at EU level with a view on how to avoid the inconsistencies still persisting.
Otherwise statistics are not reliable and comparable.
Moreover, the SAIs are of the opinion that reliable statistics should contain more information concerning VAT.
It may be useful for the Commission to provide for an analysis - based on more detailed statistics - to help Member States to enhance effectiveness in combating VAT fraud.
The two SAIs consider it helpful for Member States with a low rate to increase their efforts to reach at least the average recovery rate of the EU.
If a Member State so desires, the Commission should take an active part in this process.
5. VAT audit of large tax entities
The SAIs analysed the legal situation concerning the VAT audit of large tax entities in the two countries.
Additionally, they gathered information from the tax administrations in a questionnaire concerning areas that they considered essential for managing this issue.
Based on the replies received, it has become obvious that the situation in the two countries is diverging.
The Czech Republic has a system for steering the selection of risk prone cases which is based on a large number of relevant data (i. a. information from conducted VAT audits, data from the balance sheets and profit and loss accounts etc.).
This ensures an effective management and analysis of VAT control in general.
The establishment of a specialised tax office for the administration of large tax entities is planned for 2012.
In Germany, a similar system does not yet exist which makes it more difficult to manage and analyse VAT control in general.
Germany is still more focused on the selection of respective individual cases especially based on data from VAT returns and recapitulative statements.
The analysis of those data is supported by different risk management components which are going to be enhanced.
3. Audit procedure
3.1 Audit procedure in the Czech Republic
The audit was performed in the period from May 2009 to February 2010 by Division II - Department of State Budget Incomes and by the territorial departments IX Pilsen, X České Budějovice, XIII Brno and XV Ostrava.

3.2 Audit procedure in Germany
The audit was conducted from February 2009 to February 2010 by the audit unit for indirect taxes and staff of the assigned regional audit offices in Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich.
After selecting the case examples a number of federal states were notified of the audit mission.
Apart from interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance, the audit took place in the following federal states: • Bavaria, • Hamburg, • Hesse, • North Rhine-Westphalia, • Saxony.
Tax files of the following tax offices were included: • Erlangen, Zentralfinanzamt München, Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; • Hamburg-Nord, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg für Großunternehmen; • Wiesbaden I, Wiesbaden II, Darmstadt; • Essen-NordOst, Essen für Groß- und Konzernbetriebsprüfung, Lüdenscheid; • Chemnitz-Süd. • Wiesbaden I, Wiesbaden II, Darmstadt; • Essen-NordOst (Essen-severovýchod), Essen für Groß- und Konzernbetriebsprüfung (Essen - kontrolní úřad pro VDS a koncerny), Lüdenscheid; • Chemnitz-Süd (Chemnitz-jih).
Additionally, discussions were held with the tax offices Muhlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Sud and with the financial directorates in Frankfurt/Main, Chemnitz and Muenster.
The audit findings were reported to the Federal Ministry of Finance in April 2010.
3.3 Cooperation of the two Supreme Audit Institutions
To prepare for the parallel audits, representatives of the two audit institutions met in September 2008, to discuss and determine the audit topics.
After that in December 2008, the two SAI heads signed the agreement on cooperation in conducting the parallel audit.
At a meeting held in Bonn in June 2009, the audit teams informed each other on initial results developed during the preparation of the audit, discussed possible audit approaches and agreed upon further action.
A second meeting was held in Prague from 2 to 4 December 2009.
The audit teams shared the findings gathered by then and agreed upon the timetable for preparing the joint report.
The two SAIs decided to examine the following matters in their parallel audit mission: • follow-up on the implementation of the recommendations made in the previous report, • review of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between taxpayers from the Czech Republic and Germany that were not resolved during the previous parallel audit, • review of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between taxpayers from the Czech Republic and Germany that were classified as high-risk cases, • audit of the tax administrations' procedure in the field of international assistance for the recovery of VAT claims, • VAT audits of large companies.
The report on the results of the parallel audits was drawn up during the working meeting in June 2010.
4. Audit of administration of VAT in selected areas
4.1 Evaluation of recommendations from the previous audit
4.1.1 Evaluation of the recommendations in the Czech Republic
Recommendation 1
Conditions for registration of taxpayers should be harmonised within the EU
Based on the the previous audit results, the Czech SAI recommended adjusting the requirements of VAT payer registration and introducing new rules for cancelling the VAT payer registration in the Czech Republic.
The adjusted requirements should more effectively reduce the risk of potential VAT evasions.
In certain cases, it was found out that tax offices failed to apply their authorisation to cancel the VAT registration for the VAT payers who failed to fulfil their obligations arising from Act No. 235/2004 Coll., on value added tax (hereinafter „VAT Act“).
So far, the Czech Ministry of Finance has not drafted any amended provisions to introduce an obligation for the tax administrators to cancel the registration for a VAT payer in the event of a repeated failure to submit a VAT return.
According to the VAT Act the tax administrator can cancel the registration of a tax payer “ex officio”, if: a) The taxpayer did not perform any transactions without notification of the reason for this to the tax administrator for a period of 12 consecutive months, b) The taxpayer failed to fulfil his/her obligations pursuant to the VAT Act, c) The taxpayer ceases to be a person obliged to pay taxes.
As revealed by the previous audit, the current legislation enabled the tax office for Prague 1 to cancel the VAT registration as at 31 January of the following calendar year of the “nonresident taxpayers” who incurred no liability during the current calendar year to report and pay tax.
The tax office for Prague 1 frequently did not cancel VAT registrations for those taxpayers, since the respective provision did not lay down a sufficient time limit for cancelling the registration.
The problem was remedied by the amended VAT Act effective from 1 January 2009.
The tax administrator is authorised to cancel the registration of a non-resident tax payer, if he has found out that this tax payer has not supplied any taxable goods or services or tax exempt goods and services with a claim to deduct input VAT in the previous calendar year.
Recommendation 2
Monthly submission of recapitulative statements
As part of international cooperation, the previous audit recommended introducing monthly submissions of recapitulative statements.
The council directive that reduced the period for submissions of recapitulative statements to one month was implemented in the Czech Republic by the VAT Act, which took effect as of 1 January 2010.
A new obligation to submit the recapitulative statements in electronic format was developed.
Taxpayers have to submit their recapitulative statements also in the event of supplies of services, which are subject to determination of their place of transaction under § 9 (1) of VAT Act, to another Member State to a person registered for VAT in another Member State, provided that the recipient is obliged to report and pay VAT on those services.
The foregoing obligation ensues from Council Directive 2008/8/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC as regards the place of supply of services.
Recommendation 3
Matching data of VAT returns and recapitulative statements to reach a higher reliability of VIES data This recommendation related to the German tax administration.
The Czech administration matches data of intra-Community transactions from VAT returns and recapitulative statements of Czech taxpayers automatically in the system ATIS.
Recommendation 4
Sharing good practice criteria, components or approaches of a risk management system at EU-level
The proper collection of VAT is an indispensable prerequisite for adequate functioning of the EU internal market.
Combating VAT fraud is therefore included among the priority interest areas and has been paid considerable attention to in recent years.
The importance of this fight has been evidenced inter alia by the conclusions of a study published by the European Commission in October 2009, in which an external evaluator attempted to calculate the difference between the due and actually collected VAT amounts in 25 Member States during the period 2000-2006.
Based on an analysis of the available data, the evaluator arrived at the conclusion that the estimated loss amount of uncollected VAT for that period totalled from EUR 90 to 113 billion, while EU-25 fails to collect 12 % of due VAT on average each year.
The loss incurred on VAT by the Czech Republic in 2006 was estimated even at 18 %.
The previous audit noted, as part of international cooperation, that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by one Member State only.
Successful criteria, components or approaches of a risk management system have to be exchanged and implemented in each Member State of the EU.
Concerning the risk management system the Czech SAI audited the system of exchange of information within EU -EUROCANET.
Cases of risky intra-Community transactions carried out by taxpayers from EU presented in EUROCANET were selected for the audit (see chapter 4.3).
The objectives of improved administrative cooperation and enhanced effectiveness of combating VAT fraud should be achieved also through establishing the EUROFISC network, meant to assist improving cooperation of the responsible authorities to a level enabling disclosure of fraud already at an early stage.
Later on, the network should become a resource for assessing risk exposures in intra-Community transactions.
ECOFIN approved establishment of the EUROFISC network already on 7 October 20089 and stipulated the key principles to govern the network at the same time.
A model for EUROFISC can be seen in EUROCANET, the system already operative for the swift and selective exchange of information developed by the Belgian tax authorities in cooperation with the other Member States and with support from the European Commission and OLAF.
The objective of the system is to detect risky business transactions and entities involved in organised VAT fraud.
4.1.2 Evaluation of the recommendations in Germany
The evaluation of the recommendations of the first report resulted in the following findings:
Recommendation 1
Conditions for registration of taxpayers should be harmonised within the EU
The tax administration in Germany established a well functioning system for the registration of taxpayers that is based on a detailed questionnaire.
The Federal Ministry of Finance brought this system to the attention of the Commission in October 2007.
The system itself is being improved continuously.
The data of the questionnaire are now being recorded electronically and will subsequently be available for research so that the data are part of risk management during registration.
The Commission made a proposal to amend Regulation 1798/2003. This proposal included common standards for the registration and deregistration of taxpayers.
The Member States needed further explanation and detailed elaboration of these issues.
The German SAI requested the Federal Ministry of Finance to make sure that Germany will not go below the standards achieved.
Recommendation 2
Monthly submission of recapitulative statements
On April 8, 2010 a law was adopted for the implementation of EU directives into national law.
The law includes provisions regarding the monthly submission of recapitulative statements for intra-Community supplies.
The provisions take effect as of 1 July 2010.
Recommendation 3
Matching data of VAT returns and recapitulative statements to reach a higher reliability of VIES data and in this context considering the merger of the two procedures for VAT returns and recapitulative statements
A joint working group with staff from the federal states and the Federal Ministry of Finance had been established.
The group elaborated a strategy for the automatic matching of data from VAT returns and recapitulative statements.
The strategy is still under discussion with the federal states.
Additionally, this working group also dealt with a tool to optimise the control procedure for the internal market transactions.
Recommendation 4
Sharing of good practice criteria, components or approaches of a risk management system at EU-level Relevant information is exchanged at EU level.
Germany takes part in this exchange at “Platform on Risk Management”.
The European Commission supported the idea of such a platform and following a written consultation of 18 October 2006, the establishment of the platform on risk management was added to the Fiscalis 2006-2007 Action Plan.
The members of the platform split into sub-groups which dealt with topics such as: • Risk tools, • Influencing behaviour, • Evaluation, • Updating the risk management guide.
New reports of the sub-groups were published at the beginning of 2010.
4.1.3 Evaluation
Registration
The issue of requirements for registering and cancelling a VAT registration in different countries was addressed at EU level.
The draft of the amended Council Regulation No. 1798/2003 had proposed to expand the current databases within EU, including a database of the tax identification numbers of VAT payers.
It also provided for common minimum standards for the registration and deregistration of taxpayers.
The issues of registration and cancellation of registration have been so far left to the national legislations of the EU Member States.
The Member States needed further explanation and detailed elaboration of these issues.
The German SAI requested the Federal Ministry of Finance to make sure that Germany has not to go below the standards already achieved.
On 8 June 2010 the ECOFIN reached political agreement on the above-mentioned draft regulation.
The idea of common minimum standards has been abandoned.
Member States have to implement national procedures and only have to inform the Committee on Administrative Cooperation of these procedures.
The SAIs regret that the Commission did not succeed in convincing Member States of the necessity of common standards for registration and deregistration of taxpayers as they consider this an important element in the preventive fight against VAT fraud.
They therefore would appreciate further efforts of the Commission in this direction.
Monthly submission of recapitulative statements
As part of international cooperation, the previous audit recommended that all Member States introduce the monthly submission of recapitulative statements in order to enable earlier reviewing of the amounts of the intraCommunity transactions.
Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax to combat tax evasion connected with intra-Community transactions has reduced the interval for submission of recapitulative statements on intra-Community transactions to one month.
In the Czech Republic, this issue was implemented by the amended VAT Act effective 1 January 2010. In Germany it was implemented as of 1 July 2010.
Germany had not implemented the obligation for submitting monthly recapitulative statements on schedule, whereas the Czech Republic was in line with the EU directives.
Matching data of VAT returns and recapitulative statements in Germany to reach a higher reliability of VIES data and in this context considering the merger of the two procedures for VAT returns and recapitulative statements
The German tax administration accepted the recommendation of the German SAI and established a working group to explore possible solutions.
The work is still under way and the German SAI will closely monitor further developments.
Sharing of good practice criteria, components or approaches of a risk management system at EU-level
Germany and the Czech Republic use different risk management system approaches to identify risk-prone traders.
The Czech SAI audited the system of information exchange within EU - EUROCANET (see chapter 4. 3).
In this field the German SAI focused on German participation in the Platform on Risk Management.
4.2 Follow-up audit of selected intraCommunity transaction cases
During the previous audit, a joint review of business transactions was performed where doubts existed as to their realisation or discrepancies in the method used by the taxpayers of the two countries to report the business transactions in the VAT returns or recapitulative statements.
The two audit institutions selected nine cases for the follow-up audit that include intra-Community movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany, the audit of which carried out by the tax offices of respective countries had not been finished at the time of our previous joint audit.
1)
A Czech taxpayer acquired goods at the value of EUR 22,686 from a German taxpayer in the 1st quarter of 2005.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare the acquisition of the goods in his VAT return as the German taxpayer had no VAT ID assigned in the said period, only a tax number intended for domestic transactions in Germany.
Based on international administrative cooperation in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003, the Czech tax administrator received information that a taxpayer supplying goods to other Member States was not required by the German VAT Act to be assigned a VAT ID ensuring that intra-Community supplies of goods are exempt from VAT.
A follow-up audit by the Czech SAI revealed that based on an audit carried out by the Czech tax administrator, the Czech taxpayer submitted an additional VAT return, in which he declared the goods acquisition in the above amount and simultaneously exercised the right to a tax deduction in the same amount in the VAT return.
2)
A Czech taxpayer allegedly acquired goods worth of EUR 12,561 from a German taxpayer in the 4th quarter of 2004.
The Czech taxpayer stated he did not acquire the goods and he did not declare it in his VAT return.
The German tax administration refused cooperation upon request, invoking Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003 as the turnover on the transactions did not exceed the value of EUR 15,000.
As the Czech tax administrator did not obtain any evidence, he concluded his audit without any findings and the tax liability remained assessed at the original amount.
A follow-up audit by the Czech SAI revealed that the Czech tax administrator received two pieces of spontaneous information from Germany in accordance with the Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003, showing that the German taxpayer billed the said goods to Slovakia.
The Czech taxpayer acquired the goods from the Slovak taxpayer and stated the acquisition in his regular VAT return for the month of October 2004.
3)
A Czech taxpayer allegedly acquired a passenger car worth EUR 48,500 from a German taxpayer in the 4th quarter of 2004.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare the acquisition of the goods.
The same taxpayer did not submit any VAT returns as from August 2004. Therefore the tax administrator assessed VAT at CZK 0 for the said quarter.
Based on information obtained from Germany under international exchange of information according to Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003, the tax administrator called upon the taxpayer in March 2007 to submit an additional VAT return, which the taxpayer however failed to do.
A follow-up audit revealed that the tax administrator performed further acts in the tax proceedings in 2007 that showed that the respective passenger car was sold by the taxpayer to a secondhand car dealer in the Czech Republic.
The Czech tax administrator issued a tax assessment for the taxation period of December 2004 VAT on the acquisition of goods from another Member State and on their resale was additionally assessed in the amount of CZK 295,379.
Based on the ruling of a Regional Court, the Czech taxpayer was dissolved with liquidation and a liquidator was appointed.
In the absence of any sizable assets of the tax debtor, the above arrears appear uncollectible.
4)
A Czech taxpayer allegedly supplied new means of transport (passenger cars) to Germany in the total value of EUR 198,167 in the 4th quarter of 2004 and in the 1st quarter of 2005.
The response to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003 indicated that there have been criminal proceedings for a tax offence pending against the German entity in Germany.
A follow-up audit of the German SAI revealed that proof was obtained after conclusion of the tax proceedings in Germany to the effect that the German taxpayer was involved in fraudulent activities.
The intra-Community acquisition of the goods was taxed at EUR 182,424 (for 2004) and EUR 369,690 (for 2005).
A follow-up audit of the Czech SAI established that the Czech taxpayer was involved in carousel trading in new means of transport.
Based on information obtained from the German tax administration with regard to a review of the supply of goods, a VAT audit of the Czech tax entity was commenced for the taxation periods of April, May and June 2005.
Based on the audit findings and information obtained from international exchange of information, the tax administrator assessed additional VAT of CZK 703,031 for May 2005 and of CZK 726,551 for June 2005.
5)
Czech taxpayer A allegedly acquired a machine in the total value of EUR 58,000 from a German taxpayer in February 2005.
The foregoing German taxpayer allegedly supplied a machine at the value of EUR 88,027 to Czech taxpayer B in the 3rd quarter of 2004, while taxpayer B denied the acquisition.
A follow-up audit of the Czech SAI revealed that taxpayer B acquired the machine from a German company that had an organisational unit established in the Czech Republic.
Czech taxpayer A did not declare the acquisition of the goods from the German taxpayer in his VAT return.
The response by the German tax administrator to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003 indicated that the German taxpayer did not perform any intra-Community supply of a machine in the value of EUR 58,000 but performed a supply of goods within the Czech Republic.
A follow-up audit of the German SAI revealed that, subsequent to a completed tax audit, the intra-Community supply of the machine was reclassified as a domestic supply of the machine and the VAT exemption was cancelled.
6)
A German taxpayer allegedly supplied goods in the value of EUR 11,600 to a Czech taxpayer in the 3rd quarter of 2004.
The goods were purchased and subsequently sold in Germany in 2005.
A follow-up audit of the Czech SAI revealed that the Czech tax administrator assessed an additionally submitted VAT return that contained an unauthorised declaration of acquisition of goods from another Member State that included also the acquisition of the goods in the above value.
The German SAI found out that the German tax administrator, upon receipt of a response to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003, corrected the German taxpayer's VAT return and additionally assessed VAT of EUR 1,600.
Further movements of the goods in Germany and application of VAT in Germany are subject of a tax audit.
The German taxpayer's recapitulative statement has not been corrected as yet as any recapitulative statement adjustments may be carried out only by the taxpayer who has submitted the recapitulative statement.
7)
The Czech tax administrator received a request for information from the German tax administration in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003, inquiring whether or not a Czech taxpayer acquired a passenger car in the value of EUR 47,400 from a German taxpayer in February 2005.
After conduct of an audit for the taxation period of February 2005, the Czech tax administrator assessed the tax liability at CZK 0 for the Czech taxpayer and notified the German tax administrator that he was unable to confirm the car acquisition by the Czech taxpayer.
A follow-up audit of the Czech SAI revealed that the registration of the Czech VAT payer was cancelled in 2007 on grounds of non-compliance with obligations and the Czech tax administrator referred the supporting documents to the Czech Police.
A follow-up audit by the German SAI revealed that the German taxpayer moved his registered office and that, based on a performed audit the new competent local tax administrator cancelled the VAT exemption for the supply of the said car to the Czech taxpayer.
The German taxpayer has not so far corrected the data in his recapitulative statement and he has filed an appeal against the tax administrator's decision.
8)
According to the data in the VIES system, a German taxpayer supplied goods in the total value of EUR 33,205 to a Czech taxpayer in the period from the 3rd quarter 2004 to 1st quarter 2005.
A follow-up audit of the Czech SAI revealed that the Czech tax administrator was investigating the reasons of the differences that occurred with the Czech taxpayer at the acquisition of the goods during the period from the 3rd quarter 2004 to 1st quarter 2005.
The Czech taxpayer repeatedly submitted an additional VAT return for the 1st quarter of 2005.
The Czech tax administrator did not explain the difference in the value of the acquired goods of CZK 134,273 during the period from the 3rd quarter 2004 to 1st quarter 2005 because, according to the Czech tax administrator, business transactions for separate quarters could not be precisely traced and the tax administrator therefore accepted the submitted VAT returns.
9)
A German taxpayer supplied goods worth EUR 46,854 to a Czech taxpayer in the 3rd quarter of 2004.
For the same period, the Czech taxpayer declared an intra-Community acquisition of goods only in the value of EUR 14,856.
The Czech tax administrator reviewed the amount of the performed supplies as part of international exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003.
Attached to the response to the request for information delivered from Germany were three invoices stating the total value of the goods supply at EUR 31,998, which is an amount corresponding to the difference of the acquisition declared by the Czech taxpayer in the VAT return and VIES system data.
A follow-up audit by the Czech SAI revealed that the Czech taxpayer, following repeated reminders by the tax administrator, submitted an additional VAT return in January 2007 for the taxation period of July 2004.
In the said VAT return, the taxpayer at the same time exercised his VAT deduction right and the tax liability for the respective taxation period remained unchanged as a result of that.
The follow-up audit verified that most of the tax proceedings relating to the selected cases of business transactions between the taxpayers in Germany and the Czech Republic were concluded and adequate measures were taken by the tax administrations in the Czech Republic or in Germany (i. a. additional VAT assessments or prevention of reimbursement of input tax).
4.3 Audit of selected cases of high-risk intra-Community transactions
4.3.1 Audit findings in the Czech Republic
EUROCANET can be a major source of information for detecting risky entities within a Member State where the goods were acquired.
In the Czech Republic, the early-warning information obtained from the EUROCANET system is compared with the acquirers' data by the competent local tax offices.
Since the 1st quarter of 2008, the Czech Republic has been sending information to the EUROCANET system on risky transactions and tax entities acting as suppliers.
Nine Czech tax entities being part of the EUROCANET were selected for the audit.
They acted either as supplier to or as acquirer from the tax entities.
Relevant data was captured in the EUROCANET system by the tax administrations of other Member States.
Given the fact that the German tax administration took no part in data exchange in the EUROCANET system, no information could be obtained with the help of it whether or not suppliers with a German VAT ID have been assessed as risky entities by the German tax administration.
The audit revealed cases which included normal business transactions as well as cases of suspected involvement in carousel trading and other fraudulent activities related to VAT.
In the respective cases, tax administrators share information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003.
For example:
• The tax administrators did not detect any suspected involvement in risky transactions during the verification of the early-warning information.
Tax offices continuously monitor the tax entity for the reason of being involved in the EUROCANET system.
• The tax offices did not succeed in proving deviations from the rules for calculating the tax base and VAT from the presented accounting records during the verification of risky transaction, even though tax offices found out discrepancies in transportation and warehousing of goods or detected business relationships with suspicious and non-contactable companies from the other Member States.
• The verification of business transactions was complicated, because certain taxpayers did not cooperate with the tax administrator and could not be contacted.
Competent local tax offices mostly reviewed the risky tax entities and risky transactions set out in early-warning information from the EUROCANET system.
The tax administrators have only limited possibilities to review risky transactions concerning particularly those of so-called “missing traders”, because an inspection of the documents alone can hardly serve to prove any fraudulent activity of the tax entity.
Stricter requirements for registering taxpayers for VAT and more flexible cancellations of the registration would assist in reducing missing trader fraud.
On behalf of the tax entities involved in carousel trading and other fraudulent activities, registrations for VAT are made for the purpose of reporting EU-wide fictitious supplies of goods or issuing formally accurate tax documents to the taxpayers who then make unauthorised deductions of input VAT.
In case of suspicion that tax entities are involved in carousel trading and other fraudulent activities in connection with imports from and exports to third countries, it would be recommendable to provide for increased mutual cooperation between the customs and tax authorities.
This would help to identify goods and irregularities with transportation documents as well as monitor their physical movements within the EU in direction to the final consumer.
The Member States can participate in the system on an optional basis.
The fact that three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate in the operation of the EUROCANET system was considered as a weakness of the system by the European Parliament at the end of 200814, which should be remedied by establishing a compulsory EUROFISC network.
4.3.2 Audit findings in Germany
The German SAI analysed data available in the Federal Central Tax Office with EUROCANET data included.
These data served as basis to select six German taxpayers' files for review.
Germany as well as some other countries refused to actively join EUROCANET.
Therefore, Germany has a passive status which means that it does not send data to Brussels but is only a recipient of EUROCANET data.
The justification for doing so is that “in the view of the government it is legally not allowed that state (governmental) institutions submit data to EUROCANET.
Currently there is no legal basis in place that would permit to break applicable tax secrecy provisions.
Additionally, the government has no reliable information on how those data are used within EUROCANET by the other Member States.”15 Since October 2007, the Federal Central Tax Office has analysed the EUROCANET data and has submitted them to the tax authorities of the federal states according to a procedure agreed between them.
The German tax offices receive control information about the direct business relations of a taxpayer registered in the specific tax office with a trader from another EU Member State which was entered into EUROCANET.
However, the German tax office does not receive any information on whether the trader of the aforementioned other EU Member State had risky business relations with traders in other Member States which also did business with the respective German trader.
4.3.3 Evaluation
The Czech Republic is an active participant of EUROCANET, whereas Germany has a passive status.
From the point of view of an active participant it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to become an active member.
Consequently, the audit in this field had to be conducted in different ways.
Nevertheless, the results did not reveal great differences with regard to detecting VAT fraud cases. The reason for this is that EUROCANET is only one tool in a risk management system.
The tax administrations of both countries have a number of other tools to detect fraudulent transactions, but it is necessary to create a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.
The Council of the EU reached political agreement on a draft regulation whose main innovation is the creation of EUROFISC.
The experiences gathered so far with EUROCANET should become part of the envisaged network for fighting VAT fraud.
Member States should therefore communicate their experiences at European level.
On the other hand, the cases brought before courts of law nationally and at European level revealed that a discussion between the Member States and the Commission about the conditions for the tax exemption of intra-Community transactions seems to be necessary.
4.4 Mutual assistance for the recovery of claims
4.4.1 International assistance for the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic
The core legislation on international cooperation in recovery of certain financial claims within the EU comprises the following directives without limitation:
• Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims resulting from operations forming part of the system of financing the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, and on the agricultural levies and custom duties;
• Council Directive 2001/44/EC amending Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims resulting from operations forming part of the system of financing the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, and on the agricultural levies and customs duties and in respect of value added tax and certain excise duties;
• Commission Directive 2002/94/EC laying down detailed rules for implementing certain provisions of Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures.
Council Directive 76/308/EEC was implemented in the Czech Republic by Act No. 252/2000 Coll., on international assistance for the recovery of certain financial claims.
Following adoption of Council Directive 2001/44/EC, the Directive had to be implemented into the Czech system of law and the foregoing act had to be amended at the same time.
New Act No. 191/2004 Coll., on international assistance for the recovery of certain financial claims (hereinafter “Act No. 191/2004 Coll.”), was adopted in this connection.
A new relevant legal provision has recently been put into place by Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1179/2008 of 28 November 2008.
Annexes to the Regulation set out new models of the application forms in use as from 1 January 2009, and the Regulation newly stipulated the obligation of electronic communication and obligation of the applicant authority to certify the conformity of any sent documents with their originals.
Key principles of providing international cooperation in recovery of claims are:
1. reciprocita (vzájemnost);
2. assistance is always provided only upon request and where all requirements are fulfilled;
3. assistance shall not include any financial claims that are described as a sanction of a criminal nature in the requested state;
4. the procedure at providing international assistance for the recovery of claims must abide by the national laws of the requested state;
5. foreign claims shall have no priority over domestic claims in the recovery process;
6. assistance is provided only to recover indisputable claims;
7. exhaustion principle: the applicant state has exhausted all available means of recovery of the claim enabled by its system of law.
Act No. 191/2004 Coll., specifies three forms of giving assistance: provision of information; delivery of instruments; and recovery of claims in particular.
Procedure of sending requests for recovery to other EU Member States
A competent local tax office shall electronically transfer the request for information, request for notification or request for recovery of claims together with respective documents, to the Czech Ministry of Finance through the financial directorates.
The Czech Ministry of Finance shall provide for translating the request into the respective language, shall scan it including its attachments and, through the CCN/CSI network, and shall send it to the respective tax administration authority of the specified state.
Two basic requirements have been imposed with respect to the recovery - the claim shall exceed EUR 1,500 and shall not be older than 5 years.
The requested authority may refuse the claim recovery, if the requirements have not been met.
Procedure of receiving requests for recovery from other EU Member States
Where requests from another Member State are received, the Czech Ministry of Finance must forthwith acknowledge receipt of the request as soon as possible upon receiving it, however within seven days at the latest.
If the Czech Ministry of Finance decides it is not going to admit the request, it shall notify the applicant authority of the reasons for rejecting the request and shall set out concrete provisions of the Directive which it relies on.
Such notification should be sent no later than within three months of the date of acknowledgement of the receipt of the request.
Upon receipt of the request, the Czech Ministry of Finance shall verify if the request meets all legal requirements. After that, the Czech Ministry of Finance shall transfer the request through a financial directorate to the competent local tax office for processing.
In the event the request for recovery is accepted, the tax administrator shall i. a. identify the debtor's assets, e. g. through the extracts from the Cadastre of Real Estate, identification of bank accounts, registrations of motor vehicles with the Traffic Inspectorate etc.
When six months have elapsed from the date of the request receipt acknowledgement, the Czech Ministry of Finance should notify the applicant authority of the outcome of the investigation that has been undertaken in order to obtain the requested information.
The applicant authority should also be informed in the event that the tax entities in question cannot be contacted and the claim can therefore not be recovered.
Any amount successfully recovered by the tax administrator shall be transferred to the applicant authority within one month from the date on which such claim was recovered.
The Czech tax administrator making efforts to recover foreign claims may use an option to allow a moratorium on the payment of the claim or its payment by instalments, providing the applicant state gives its consent to that.
The interest or penalty charge is assessed to the debtor for the recovery period in accordance with Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on administration of taxes and fees.
Such interest or penal charges shall pertain to the state that has requested the recovery.
Concerning received requests for recovery, the Czech Ministry of Finance did not submit the requests to the competent tax administrators in time, particularly during 2006 and 2007.
A similar situation was identified with respect to the requests for international assistance for the recovery of the claims received from the tax administrators in the Czech Republic.
The audit revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance did not proceed in accordance with the Act on the international assistance for the recovery of claims because it failed to notify a competent authority of the Member State of the progress made with the recovery within the six months time period from the day when the receipt of the request was acknowledged.
The situation has improved since 2008.
Statistical data
The Czech Ministry of Finance prepares statistical data for the European Commission in accordance with § 13 (4) of Act No. 191/2004 Coll., by 15 March each year, setting out the number of information, notification and recovery requests sent and/or received in the previous year, the amount of the claims involved and the amounts recovered according to the year of request to which they relate.
Based on the supporting data provided by all Member States, the European Commission reports the Council and the European Parliament on the use of the provisions on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims.
The audit revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance understated its statistical data by EUR 5,250,000 due to an error in the item of claims recovered in 2008, as a result of an incorrectly stated amount of the VAT claim subject to recovery (the error consisted in a shifted decimal marker when translating the CZK amount of the claims into its EUR equivalent).
The error subsequently was reflected in the European Commission statistics.
Information on the mutual assistance with recoveries is set out in the table below.
4.4.2 International assistance for the recovery of claims in Germany
The legal authority for international administrative assistance in tax matters derives from European Community law, Council Directive 2008/55/EC of 26 May 2008 (EC Recovery Directive) and Commission Regulation of 28 November 2008 (EC implementing Directive).
For the sake of better readability and clarity, the EC Recovery Directive codifies Council Directive 76/308/EEC of 15 March 197619, whose provisions have been amended substantially several times.
The provisions apply i. a. to the recovery of VAT and of taxes on income and capital including the related interest charges and penalties.
The EC Recovery Directive was transposed into domestic German law by the Collection of State Taxes (EC) Act of 3 May 2003.
The enforcement procedure in Germany is governed by the German Fiscal Code.
Article 117.2 of the Code points out, that tax authorities may provide international judicial and administrative assistance by virtue of international treaties and legal instruments of the European Communities that are applicable within the national jurisdiction and of the EC Administrative Assistance Act.
Part six of the German Fiscal Code (Articles 249-346), embodies the legal provisions governing enforcement procedure.
The administrative operations of the tax authorities are governed especially by the Execution Instruction and the Enforcement Instruction.
The Federal Ministry of Finance reached agreement with the representatives of the supreme tax authorities of the federal states (Laender) on the principles of administrative assistance with tax assessment and transferred its own responsibility in this matter to the Federal Central Tax Office.
General preconditions for submitting requests for recovery are:
• Legal prerequisites have to be fulfilled (§§ 251, 254 German Fiscal Code (AO)).
• All available domestic means of recovery have been exhausted.
• The claims for which recovery assistance is requested have to be definitive.
• The period between the issuing of the enforcement order or the date when the claim becomes final (is no longer subject to appeal) and the date of the request may not exceed 5 years.
• The total amount of the claim shall exceed EUR 1,500.
Procedure of sending requests for recovery to other EU Member States
German requests for recovery of delinquent tax liabilities are sent from the execution units of the tax offices to the relevant foreign authority as for instance the Czech CLO via the intermediate authority and the Federal Central Tax Office.
Details are governed by the Guidance on International Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (Recovery) of 19 January 2004.23 This Guidance is currently being revised by a Federal Government/Laender working group and adapted to the new Recovery Directive.
The request together with the attachments is submitted electronically by the tax office to the intermediate authority.
This authority checks whether it is correct in terms of content and form.
If not, the request is returned to the respective tax office.
Otherwise the request is submitted to the Federal Central Tax Office.
The Federal Central Tax Office will then provide for the necessary communication with the respective foreign authority, including the translation of the request.
Procedure of receiving requests for recovery from other EU Member States
Requests for recovery received from other Member States are being registered in the Federal Central Tax Office and an acknowledgement of receipt is sent out within 10 days.
Additionally, the Federal Central Tax Office checks whether the formal requirements are met.
In principle the Federal Central Tax Office submits these requests to the intermediate authority, which in turn submits them to the respective tax office and monitors execution.
The Federal Central Tax Office also sends interim and/or final reports.
If the handling of a request takes more than 6 months, it will remind the intermediate authority of the interim report that is required according to the article 16 of Commission Directive 2002/94/EG.
After having checked the formal and factual preconditions of a request, the execution units announce enforcement measures.
Any amount recovered has to be transferred to the bank account given in the request within one month after receipt.
Statistical data
Information on the mutual assistance for the recovery of claims between Germany and the Czech Republic for 2006-2008 (as of 31 December 2008).
4.4.3 Audit of recovery requests, case studies
A total of 21 requests for international assistance for the recovery of claims between the Czech Republic and Germany were selected for the audit as part of international cooperation.
A review of ten selected cases revealed, without limitation:
1.
On 20 October 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request from Germany for the recovery of a claim to VAT for the years 2004 and 2005, totalling EUR 3,883 = CZK 109,820, concerning a Czech tax entity.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request for recovery to the tax administrator as late as on 26 February 2008.
In order to secure the claim to be recovered, the Czech tax administrator established a security interest in real estate owned by the Czech tax entity.
Since the pledged property alone was not sufficient to satisfy the total claim to be recovered, payment by instalments of at least CZK 2,000 monthly was agreed with the Czech tax entity.
On 31 August 2009, information on the claim recovery progress was sent to the German tax administration, noting that the claim was partly recovered in the amount of CZK 49,600 through the instalments as of 25 August 2009.
The said amount was remitted to Germany and, on 28 August 2008, another instalment of CZK 3,000 was sent to Germany.
2.
On 7 January 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for recovery of the tax arrears of a Czech tax entity owing in Germany the amount of EUR 180,869 = CZK 4,434,915 of VAT, income tax and interest and fees.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request to the tax administrator as late as on 27 November 2008.
The tax administrator, based on a review of ownership of bank accounts, securities, real estate, motor vehicles and movable assets established that the debtor owned no distrainable assets.
An investigation on site further revealed that the debtor had not been present at his permanent domicile address for more than a year.
His whereabouts in the Czech Republic are unknown.
This notification was received by the Czech Ministry of Finance on 6 April 2009, while the tax administrator sent its response to the German tax administration on 16 April 2009.
3.
The Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for recovery from Germany on 21 November 2007, concerning the tax arrears of a Czech tax entity totalling EUR 3,139 = CZK 84,846 in VAT plus interest and fees.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the recovery request as late as on 6 August 2008, although the Czech Ministry of Finance meanwhile received a notification from Germany on 18 February 2008 that the Czech tax entity already had settled the claim in Germany.
On 9 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance notified the tax administrator that this recovery case had been closed because the claim had been paid by the Czech tax entity in Germany.
The said claim, however, was paid also in the Czech Republic under the recovery process and credited to Germany on 27 October 2008.
Given the long time taken by the Czech Ministry of Finance to inform the authorised tax administrator, the claim was paid twice - by the entity itself in Germany and once again through the claim recovery by the Czech tax administrator.
In cooperation with the German SAI, it was ascertained that the recovered amount will be offset against a claim under another recovery request totalling EUR 6,649 and intended for sending to the Czech Republic in September 2008.
With respect to the company in question, the Czech Ministry of Finance records show only a request for claim recovery at EUR 3,139 while the request for recovering the claim of EUR 6,649 was not in the Czech Ministry of Finance records.
4.
On 15 September 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request from Germany for recovery of the tax arrears of a Czech tax entity owing in Germany the amount of EUR 39,957 = CZK 956,654 of income tax and VAT, interest and fees.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request to the Czech tax administrator on 19 December 2008.
On 1 June 2009, a procedure for claim recovery was started; an order for the distraint of the bank accounts in the Czech Republic and for the attachment of wages in the amount of CZK 7,000 was issued.
During the negotiations with the tax administrator, the debtor stated that he disagreed with the amount of the claim and considered it disputable.
According to the Czech tax administrator, the tax entity was previously willing to pay EUR 250 monthly, which was, however, not accepted by the German tax administrator.
The tax entity promised to discuss its application with the German tax administrator, with an aim to reach a changed amount of the claim.
The claim recovery process still continued during the Czech SAI's audit.
5.
On 19 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for recovery from Germany concerning a Czech tax entity owing the total of EUR 113,444 = CZK 3,116,304 of income tax for 2005 and VAT for the years 2003-2007, interest and fees.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request to tax office for Prague 1, which is authorised to administer taxes of the non-resident tax entities in the Czech Republic, as late as on 14 November 2008, since the competent local tax administrator could not be determined based on the available address of the tax entity.
The tax office obtained information during the performed investigation that the debtor has an income of EUR 4,704 on 19 September 2008, for which the tax office has been however unable to issue an execution order as the request for the claim recovery was transferred to the tax office after that date.
On 26 January 2009, the Czech tax administrator commenced the claim recovery process and issued an execution order to secure the claim against the debtor's cash held in the accounts kept with banks and credit unions.
The claim recovery process still continued during the Czech SAI's audit.
6.
On 3 October 2006, the Czech tax administrator requested international cooperation for the recovery of a claim for VAT and cost of proceedings, totalling CZK 146,223,742.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request for recovery to the German tax administration as late as on 13 May 2008.
On 8 September 2008, the German tax administrator transferred the amount obtained through the seizure of the funds on the debtor's account at the amount of EUR 17,700 = CZK 439,226 through Bundesbank to the Czech authorities.
On reviewing the amounts of the recovered claims, an error in translation of the amount subject to recovery was identified.
The recovered amount of CZK 146,223,742 was translated at the rate EUR 1 = CZK 25.065, however with an error resulting in an amount of EUR 583,378.
The correct translation of the amount subject to recovery is EUR 5,833,782.
The request for recovery sent to Germany was lower by EUR 5,250,404 as a result of that.
7.
On 1 March 2007, the Czech tax administrator sent a request to the Czech Ministry of Finance for the recovery of the tax arrears of a Czech tax entity owing the total of CZK 1,970,632 = EUR 79,847 of VAT, interest and charges.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request to the tax administration in Germany as late as on 10 November 2008.
On 4 February 2009, the German tax administrator called upon the debtor to pay the arrears.
In view of considerable drops in the company's turnover in the second half of 2008 and in the first half of 2009 in particular and given the related liquidity situation of the company, the following payments were made to repay the arrears: on 8 April 2009 -EUR 4,600; on 6 May 2009 - EUR 3,000; and, on 16 June 2009 - EUR 2,500.
The payments were credited to the tax administrator's account in the Czech Republic.
On 23 June 2009, the German tax administrator reached an agreement with the debtor that the latter would pay another instalment of EUR 2,500 by 30 June 2009.
8.
A request for recovery of the claim totalling EUR 398,653 = CZK 9,832,779 and including also a claim for property transfer tax was delivered by the Czech tax administrator to the Czech Ministry of Finance on 22 May 2008.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request for recovery to the German tax administration on 2 October 2008.
On 3 April 2009, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a notification from the German tax administration that the request was returned by the German tax administration.
The German tax administration justified the return by explaining that the property transfer tax did not constitute a tax as per Art. 2(e)(f)(g) and (h) of Directive 2008/55/EC.
The German tax administration further added that Art. 2(g) applied to the claims relating to income tax and taxes on assets.
Accordingly, Art. 3 of Directive 2008/55/EC applies to income and asset taxes not listed in Art. 1(3) in combination with paragraph (4) of Council Directive 77/799/EEC.
The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed to prepare and submit a new recovery request excluding the property transfer tax arrears at the amount of CZK 61,759, while setting out the arrears for VAT, corporate income tax and individual income tax, and to resend the request to the German tax administration.
The Czech Ministry of Finance received a new request from the Czech tax administrator for the recovery of the tax arrears relating to the same tax entity which owed the amount of CZK 7,079,735 of the liable income tax and VAT.
9.
On 6 February 2006, the Czech tax administrator sent a recovery request to the Czech Ministry of Finance with respect to the tax arrears of a Czech tax entity owing the total of CZK 3,445,782 = EUR 123,328 of individual income tax and VAT.
The aggregate amount of VAT was CZK 1,133,967.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request to the tax administration in Germany as late as on 18 April 2007.
The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded a response by the German tax administration of 9 July 2007 to the Czech tax administrator as late as on 11 November 2008.
The response stated that the German tax administrator issued an execution order for the bank account with a bank on 11 June 2007, however was advised by the bank the debtor had no business relationship with the tax entity.
As a result, the German tax administration considered the case closed.
10.
On 26 September 2005, the Czech tax administrator dispatched a request for recovery to the Czech Ministry of Finance concerning VAT arrears totalling CZK 1,296,845 = EUR 43,591.
The request by the Czech tax administrator was delivered to the Czech Ministry of Finance on 10 October 2005.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request to the German tax administration on 15 December 2005.
Prior to dispatching the request for recovery, the Czech tax administrator distrained funds of the debtor in a bank account, obtained an attachment of wages and established a security interest in real property.
The recovery request was preceded by a request for information sent to the German tax administrator on 16 March 2005.
According to the response to the request for information received by the Czech tax administrator on 16 September 2005, the Czech tax entity was resident in Germany and had an income of EUR 8,437 from a non-business activity.
The Czech Ministry of Finance received a response to the request for recovery on 20 April 2006 and passed it on to the Czech tax administrator as late as on 12 February 2008.
The response stated that no recovery proceedings could be instituted in Germany due to the debtor's insolvency, that no assets of the debtor were identified and that his income from non-business activities had been already a subject of other execution proceedings.
As a result, the German tax administration deemed the request for recovery complied with.
4.4.4 Comparison and evaluation
In the area of international assistance for the recovery of claims, all EU Member States are governed by the same European legislative arrangements.
The procedures for handling requests for international assistance with the recovery of claims are similar in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The German and the Czech SAI compared the statistics that the two Member States had sent to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.
The statistics contained inconsistencies.
In its report of 2006, the European Commission recommended that the Member States needed to take greater care in establishing their statistics.
In its report from 2009 the Commission concluded that the discrepancies in the statistics had decreased although the number of requests had increased.
The two SAIs considered it useful to discuss the matter of statistics again at EU level.
Discussion should focus on how to avoid the inconsistencies that still persist. Otherwise statistics are not reliable and comparable.
Moreover the two SAIs are of the opinion that reliable statistics should disclose the annual number of requests as well as the nature of claims concerned (VAT, income tax etc.) and amounts of the claims recovered per Member State.
The two SAIs consider it useful that the Commission provides for a more detailed analysis of the statistics submitted by the Member States, because this may help the Member States to assess their own effectiveness in combating VAT fraud.
As the recovery rate can be calculated per Member State, the two SAIs consider it helpful that Member States with a low rate should increase their efforts to reach at least the average recovery rate of the EU.
If a Member State so desires, the Commission should take an active part in this process.
Concerning the requests for recovery received, the Czech Ministry of Finance submitted the requests to the competent tax administrators with delay in particular during 2006 and 2007.
A similar situation was identified with respect to the requests for international assistance for the recovery of the claims received from the tax administrators in the Czech Republic.
The audit revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance did not proceed in accordance with the Act No. 191/2004 Coll. for the international assistance for the recovery of claims, because it failed to notify a competent authority of the Member State of the progress of the recovery efforts within the six months time period from the day of acknowledgement of receiving the request.
4.5 VAT audit of large tax entities
4.5.1 VAT audit of large tax entities in the Czech Republic
Všeobecné informace
Správa DPH u VDS byla zajišťována obdobně jako u ostatních daňových subjektů.
The procedure for the large tax entity audit is based on Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on administration of taxes and fees.
The Czech Ministry of Finance defined large tax entities as natural or legal persons founded or established for the purpose of doing business and whose net turnover for the taxation period declared in their individual or corporate income tax return amounted to CZK 2 bn and more.
Classification of a tax entity as large tax entity was carried out following its income tax return submission for the respective taxation period, and for 2003 for the first time.
The tax entity ceased to be classified as an large tax entity in the event that its net turnover for the taxation period dropped below the above mentioned limit during three successive taxation periods counted from the end of the period for which the entity submitted its tax return based on which it was then classified under large tax entity.
No tax entity could be removed from the large tax entities' records without a tax audit of at least one tax type for at least one period being performed before.
All large tax entities were audited at least every five years until the end of 2009.
Since 2010, a written evaluation of the tax entity needs to be performed at least once every 2 years, while the selected follow-up procedure has to eliminate tax risks and their negative implications for the accurate assessment and collection of taxes.
The audits shall focus on at least one tax type, while, as a rule, the tax administrator selects several tax periods for a single exercise.
The large tax entities were audited by staff of the specialised audit departments - established at 13 tax offices in total -or audit departments of the competent local tax offices.
A specialised audit department carries out tax audits within its local competence area as determined by the director of the financial directorate.
Kromě kontroly VDS kontroluje též:
• tax entities engaged in uncommon and specific business fields,
• entities whose tax audits involve special expertise and time demands,
• entities with an intricate territorial and organisational structure,
• entities suspected of large-scale tax evasions,
• entities that are members of chains and networks, where suspicions exist of large-scale tax evasions and of unjustifiable excessive deductions.
The number of tax audits performed by the specialised audit departments of tax offices and their results are set out in Table No. 3.
The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed to amend the Act No. 531/1990 Coll., on territorial financial authorities, specifically by establishing a specialised tax office with the nation-wide competence for the selected tax entities (i. a. for legal persons incorporated for the purpose of doing business and having a turnover of more than CZK 2 bn).
4.5.2 VAT audit of large tax entities in Germany
Obecné informace
VAT audits of large companies are governed by the same rules as tax audits in general, i. e. the relevant provisions are laid down in • the German Fiscal Code (AO), • the Fiscal Administration Act (FVG), and • tax audit regulations (BpO).
Additional documents for guidance are in place.
German Fiscal Code
The legal provisions provided for in articles 193-203 of the German Fiscal Code in “Section IV - tax field audit”: in particular, these articles embody the rules for the admissibility of a tax field audit (audit on the premises of an enterprise), its scope as to subject matter, rules on allocation of responsibilities, the form and content of audit notification, audit principles, the taxable person's duties to cooperate and the prerequisites for holding final discussions and communicating the audit report.
Tax field audits are carried out by the responsible tax offices (Article 195 of the Code).
Fiscal Administrative Act According to Article 5.1 item 1 in connection with Art. 19 of the Act, the participation in tax field audits carried out by tax offices is incumbent on the Federal Central Tax Office.
The nature and scope of the participation of the Federal Central Tax Office in tax field audits are agreed between the authorities involved.
Moreover the Federal Central Tax Office is entitled to demand that specific enterprises it has named are audited at a time it has specified.
In this case it may promulgate rules for the conduct and contents of audits on the premises of these companies.
Tax Audit Regulations Pursuant to Article 108.7 of the German Constitution, the Tax Audit Regulations (German abbreviation: BpO 2000) were promulgated with the consent of the Bundesrat (the upper chamber of the German Parliament on which the Lander governments are represented).
The administrative regulations applied to tax field work of Lander tax authorities and the Federal Central Tax Office.
Enterprises are classified according to size at regular intervals pursuant to Article 3 of the Regulations.
Large enterprises are to be subjected to a follow-up audit (Article 4.2 of the Regulations).
Article 33.1 of the Regulations, each cognisant tax authority has to keep a register of groups of companies being also defined in the Regulations.
Administrative guidance
In addition, the following documents provide additional guidance for the tax administration:
• Uniform Manual for special VAT audits in Germany;
• USLO Manual, which provides guidance on the use of the data on intra-Community business relations held on VIES;
• working aids for different and special subjects.
• ZAUBER Manual, which provides guidance on the use of the database ZAUBER;
The classification of tax entities is based on criteria like turnover and net income with different thresholds according to the line of business.
The figures are made public by the Federal Ministry of Finance.
They are evaluated every three years and fixed for the following three years.
The number of businesses - not only large businesses - has to be ascertained at regular audit intervals (latest interval: 1st January 2010).
In general, large businesses have to be audited continuously.
The audits are generally announced including VAT.
That means: during the audit timeframe especially income tax or corporation tax, trade tax, and VAT - all kinds of relevant taxes - have to be audited finally.
VAT audits can be carried either by tax auditors or by VAT auditors.
This varies and depends on the organisational structure in the federal states.
The number of taxation periods covered by an audit varies regularly between 3 and 5 years.
The BpO 2000 assumes an audit period of 3 years.
All taxes a company was assessed for are subject to review.
4.5.3 Management of audits of large tax entities
As both SAIs decided not to review individual cases they focused on management questions to get a picture on how the tax administrations handle the issue of VAT audits of large tax entities.
Based on a questionnaire, they gathered information from the tax administrations concerning areas that they considered essential for managing this issue.
• What statistical records and analyses concerning the VAT audit of large businesses are available to the management of the tax administration?
In particular:
• Are there any statistics or records about the extent to which a distinction is drawn between fighting VAT fraud and general VAT inspection?
The Czech Republic: No, system ATIS in current data version does not allow drawing this difference.
Germany: The tax administration does not differentiate between an audit designed to combat VAT fraud and a general VAT inspection.
• Are there any statistics or records about the timeliness of VAT audits (in relation to the time of the transactions audited)?
The Czech Republic: Records about the timeliness of enquiries relevant to intra-Community acquisition of goods of selected VAT taxpayers are shown in system ATIS.
Additionally, such information as how long did the enquiries take is also part of the data recorded in ATIS.
Germany: No, the unified statistics on federal level for tax auditors only contain information on the average last audit period (year).
This is a figure that does not provide an overview of the selected audit periods with respect to individual entrepreneurs.
VAT auditors focus on the latest VAT assessment periods and are also entitled to audit large tax entities.
But the statistics on federal level for special VAT auditors does not provide information concerning the classification of tax entities.
• Are there any statistics or records about the nature of the additionally generated VAT revenues; divided e.g. according to the following features:
i. genuine increase in tax liability (e. g. application of a reduced tax rate instead of the standard VAT rate)
ii. only nominal increase in tax liability (e. g. shift of a full-compliance VAT case to a different taxable period)
iii. additional tax revenue collected (payment of the outstanding additional tax due)
The Czech Republic:
The Czech tax administration monitors the numbers of tax verifications performed, levels of additional tax assessment broken down by types of tax, by the number of audited tax subjects and by the number of controlled taxable periods.
Other tax procedures (local investigation, reproach procedure) are monitored in the same way.
As an independent task, data and the amount of additionally paid taxes are recorded.
Statistics of general debts broken down by types of tax but not according to declared tax or tax found out by a tax administrator are also kept.
Germany: No, the unified statistics on federal level for tax auditors and special VAT auditors do not distinguish between the above mentioned criteria.
Moreover most of the tax administrations visited do not make such a distinction either.
• Are audit fields that yield high additional revenues recorded?
The Czech Republic: Yes, the tax administrator is in a position to select taxpayers for verification on the basis of criteria which can be linked with chosen indicators in special parts of ATIS.
Germany: There are no regulations at federal government level (Bund).
Subsequently the unified statistics on federal level for tax auditors and special VAT auditors do not provide such information.
But there is one coordinated approach of the ministries of finance of the “Lander” and the “Bund”.
In the ZAUBER data base, tax auditors or tax investigators of the federal states (Lander) have to register their assessed increase in VAT liability if it exceeds a certain amount.
In this case, they have to specify e. g. the nature of the assessed increase in VAT liability.
• What are the most frequent findings?
The Czech Republic:
- large tax entities exercised an unauthorised right to deduct input VAT for supplies and services,
• that were not used to perform any economic activity as per § 72 (1) of the VAT Act;
• that were used for any entertainment purposes as per § 75 (3) of the VAT Act;
• based on tax documents that did not meet the requirements as laid down in § 73 (1) of the VAT Act;
- large tax entities did not declare output VAT as per § 21 (1) of the VAT Act.
Germany: There are no regulations at federal government level (Bund).
Subsequently the unified statistics at federal level for tax auditors and special VAT auditors do not provide such information.
Findings in respect to VAT are not separately recorded by the federal states (Lander) as far as they result from tax audits of large companies.
But in the ZAUBER database in which tax auditors or tax investigators of the federal states (Lander) have to register their assessed increase in VAT liability exceeding a certain amount, the Federal Central Tax Office is able to analyse such information.
• Does the tax administration analyse audit fields that produce a high ‘yield' and does it draw the consequences for the management?
The Czech Republic: Yes, for example they launch national audit proceedings aimed at risky commodities or a subject of economic activity.
Germany: There are no regulations at federal government level (Bund).
The unified statistics on federal level for tax auditors and special VAT auditors do not provide information about audit fields that produce a high ‘yield'.
There are diverse opinions on the process of analysing as well as of managing cases under the aspect of materiality.
Some regional tax offices provide special information; but the tax offices are free to make use of them.
4.5.4 Comparison and evaluation
The different answers of both Member States show that the Czech Republic provides a system that collects a lot of information including information about conducted VAT audits as well as data of the balance sheets and the profit and loss accounts.
On the basis of a wide range of information the Czech Republic is able to steer the selection of risk prone cases.
The same applies to analysis and management of VAT control in general.
In the Czech Republic the establishment of a specialised tax office for the administration of large tax entities is planned in 2012.
In Germany, the tax administration does not collect such information.
Subsequently it is more difficult to fulfil these tasks in a similar way.
But nevertheless Germany's philosophy places more focus on selecting respective individual cases based on VAT return information submitted.
Therefore risk management components are going to be enhanced and improved.
On the basis of adequate reference notes, well trained tax auditors have to assess the accurate amount of VAT.
The two SAIs are of the opinion that Member States should be able to provide adequate management as well as an adequate risk management system.
This will help reduce VAT shortfalls.
As a result, VAT revenue as well as the risk for unreliable entrepreneurs to be detected will increase.
5. Conclusions
The cooperation of the two SAIs within the parallel audits of the administration of VAT achieved the objectives set by the German and Czech SAI.
The two SAIs developed a deeper understanding of the applicable systems in the Czech Republic and Germany in the fields of: • intra-Community transactions, • risk management of VAT, especially concerning the selection of risk prone transactions, • recovery of VAT claims, and • VAT audits of large tax entities.
Due to mutual cooperation, differences of strategies to detect VAT fraud cases and in the above mentioned areas of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany were revealed.
Audit findings were compared and on their basis best practices were identified.
Furthermore, the SAIs hope that the results achieved may encourage stakeholders to enter into discussions about approaches and strategies within and among Member States as well as with the EU Commission.
The invaluable experience and knowledge gained by cooperation of the two SAIs may serve as an encouragement to conduct future audit missions of VAT administration.
6. Communique
The report has been drawn up in Czech, English and German and signed by the two Presidents of the Czech and German SAI.
Editorial deadline: June 2010.

Handball: Women Division: Ahlener SG keeps a clean sheet against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlen players especially had trouble with the third league player Carolin Stallmann, who scored ten goals on her own.
I was actually pretty satisfied with the defense. Only one player scored too many goals.
We did not get that under control, said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
He was more annoyed by the many opportunities that were left on the table.
The focus at the end made his team miss the victory this time.
The ASG lagged behind until the break with 11:12 and later still with 15:18 (minute 45).
Towards the end, the broader bench of the hosts made a decisive impact.
In addition, Aydogdu Rückraum put Merle Klement on the left wing, who then made "decisive goals in an extremely clever way" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.

Volleyball: Women's 3rd League: Top performance by BSV Ostbevern in the championship game at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of the BSV Ostbevern have established themselves again in the top group of the 3. League West.
On the home field of relegated club’s VC Allbau Essen, the blue-and-white won with 3-1.
It was a huge step in a cool season.
It’s so much fun to play in the upper third of the league.
This is what we have been working towards, says trainer Dominik Münch excitedly after an almost flawless performance by his team at the now defeated table leader.
In the first part, the guests dominated almost however they wanted.
With 4-1, 16-10 and 22-12, the runner-up of the previous year won with a 25-15.
Essen played with two lines, but has not come into play.
We kept them on their toes.
Our opponent struck with a high risk, but also produced countless penalty cards.
In the second set, the BSV already led with 12-8. "Essen changed to three lines.
We could not hold the pressure.
Essen moved in closer, and we let ourselves be lulled a bit," Münch continued.
At 18:17, the volleyball players from the Ruhr area were in front.
Although Ostbevern defended four set balls at 19:24, the fifth attempt found its target.
The game was now in a better class, believes the trainer about the performance.
Maike Rüdingloh and then Wiebke Silge made huge contributions with their serves that BSV turned the page in the third set from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "We played consistently and calmly."
At 7-3 and 15-13, the blue-white added part four with 25:22 to their side.
Vera Horstmann was voted as the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier also had an outstanding day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea und Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.

International: Turkish community: Mosque opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way the great Ditib Mosque was opened in Cologne by the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a pile of shards in the German-Turkish relationship, which can be put together only with difficulty, said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, to the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and German side missed the opportunity to have a joint reconciliatory appearance.
Instead of highlighting the Muslims’ affiliation with Germany side by side with top German politicians, Erdogan used the event for his own purposes, complained Sofuoglu.
The widespread exclusion of the German public had encouraged "many reservations."

Nottuln Home Association: The offer has already been established
It’s Folk Festival time again finally after the long summer break
On October 18th (Thursday) at 19:30, the Heimatverein Nottuln already hosts his fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of the old Amtmannei.
It’s almost exactly a year to the day since we met here for a Folk Festival for the first time.
This event has now become a fixture in the musical event calendar in Nottuln,” says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottuln Home Association, pleased.
I would not have thought that our Folktreff got established so quickly in Nottuln.
Whether it was the storm Friederike in January or the heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the ‘Amtmannei’ was always full.
As always, the program for the next Folk Festival is a colorful mix of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, evergreens an old hits, says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who is always inviting musical friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer has promised to play his accordion for the first Folk Festival “birthday.”
He was a member of “Gaitling” many years ago, a group from the neighboring district of Steinfurt, which played music with Low German lyrics.
Now he's a member of an Irish folk band.
The creators of the Folk Festival fondly remember the last event in the summer when Christoph Schultz from the Folk Festival Emsdetten excited the audience with his international version of the song “Frogs in the Night” and sent them home with the song stuck in their heads.
We are expecting many happy guests to spend another sociable and humorous evening together, says the invitation from the Home Association.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to actively participate is invited to join in.
Since the coveted seats are always taken quickly, it’s recommended to get there early enough.
The Folk Festival will start at 7:30 pm, but admission begins at 7 pm.

China approves planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons all open questions must be clarified by October 24.
Frankfurt Linde and Praxair are one step further to becoming the world’s largest industrial gases company.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the planned merger, Linde said on Sunday.
This means that only the authorisations from South Korea and - as the biggest hurdle - in the USA are still outstanding for the multi-billion dollar merger.
The chances of the approval of an insider has improved recently as a result, because Linde has confirmed the sale of additional company parts.
All outstanding issues must be resolved by October 24th for legal reasons, for the merger to succeed.

From clean fruit to ecology
The 125th anniversary of the District Association for Gardening and Landscape Conservation was celebrated with a gala at the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle.
On September 29 1893 a fruit show in the Kulmbach community hall set the last impulses for the founding of the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach (District Association for Gardening and Landscape Conservation Kulmbach), and exactly 125 years later, on Saturday night, the association celebrated the big anniversary in the Kulmbach Stadthalle (civic centre).
Frankly the association had a different name at that time: In the year 1893 the mayor Wilhelm Flessa ammounced the name as "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" (District Fruit Growing Association Kulmbach City and Country).
The purpose of the fruit-growing association differed from that of today’s work - in fact, it was purely about fruit growing and nobody thought about flowers and gardening at that time.
At that time, in the era of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elite, explained the local history curator Günter Dippold in his speech.
Fruit trees lined the highways, so-called industrial gardens were created at schools.
Today fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 gardening clubs in the district of Kulmbach, which include almost 7 000 members.
But by far that is not the end of the scope.
Gardening close to nature, biological crop protection, village beautification and nutrition play just as important a role as does communicating knowledge about healthy diets and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwürfe" (moles) showed entertainingly on stage how versatile the tasks of a gardening club are.
Youth work is critically important, especially in the digital age, said Günter Reif, chairman of the district council, and the lord mayor Henry Schramm also emphasised how important experiences in nature are for life.
Collecting chestnuts was for us as children a huge thing, I doubt that with Smartphone & Co. it is possible to collect a similar quantity of joy.
Schramm promised to plant two trees for the anniversary with district administrator Klaus Peter Söllner .
Where the trees will be planted will be decided by the district association, added district administrator Söllner and emphasised the special importance of the gardening associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, the beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many gardening associations in the district, was also stated without doubt by the county manager and consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He presented the numerous visitors an illustrated lecture about the long history of the district association and reported among other things, how necessary self-sufficiency was after the war.
In the old days everything came from the garden, for the winter conserves were made.
At the end of the 50s, the kitchen garden was transformed into an ornamental and live-in garden.
Nature endures, it existed before us and we must adapt ourselves to it, pleaded the specialist in fruit and nut trees.
There is an incentive therefore for the gardening associations not to give up, so that our country remains beautiful and worth living.
Also involved is the welcoming of new citizens to our associations, explained the President of the Bavarian Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
We must stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren, Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony, which was festively framed by the tower brass musicians of the Thurnau music association.

Priority on Nafta talks: Canada’s foreign minister reschedules UN speech
Mexico’s government wants clarity in Nafta issues: Both trading partners are set an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada’s foreign minister is now giving trading agreements absolute priority - and is delaying her speech for the United Nations.
Due to the time pressure involved in the struggle for a new edition of the North American free trade agreement (Nafta) with the USA and Mexico, the Canadian foreign minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN general debate in New York.
Instead of today, Saturday, the minister will not speak before the United Nations general assembly until Monday, shared her spokesperson Adam Austen.
In the meantime she will concentrate on the renegotiation of Nafta.
On Friday the Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo explained that Canada and the USA had 48 hours to agree if Canada really wanted to join the trade agreement that had already been made between his country and the USA.
In August the USA and Mexico agreed on a new version of the regional Nafta free trade agreement.
US President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in future.
The talks concerning revision have been ongoing for over a year.
They will have concluded by Sunday evening (local time) and Trump’s government will submit the agreement to the US Senate before October 1.
On Friday Mexico’s President-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador announced that should the negotiations fail then Mexico would attempt achieving a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Report on the Results of the Parallel Audit of the Administration of Value Added Tax in the Czech Republic and in the Federal Republic of Germany
Foreword
The Lima Declaration was adopted in 1977 and emphasises that the supreme audit institutions (SAI) have powers to carry out audits of all public finances.
The Declaration requests that SAI shall be empowered to audit the collection of taxes as extensively as possible.
The European Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxes one of the most significant parts of the public revenues.
The VI Congress EUROSAI held in Bonn in 2005 focused on an audit of public revenues by SAI.
One of the important steps on the way to optimise the audit activity of a SAI is to work out a special strategy for audit of public revenues.
This relates above all to taxes as the biggest source of public revenues that is also at a high risk of loss.
Since the economies of individual countries are more and more interconnected and interdependent SAI can be, in a certain manner, unable to perform audit activities without cooperation with SAI of other countries.
As an example we can mention the audit of internationally organised fraud that causes significant revenue losses in many countries.
In fighting against such crime, the cooperation between authorities is a necessity.
SAI that carry out audits in this area need to be willing to work closely together.
The idea to carry out an audit on value added tax (hereinafter “VAT”) and the VIES system came up at the VI EUROSAI Congress in Bonn. This audit was performed in cooperation between the Czech Supreme Audit Office and the German Supreme Audit Institution, Bundesrechnungshof.
During following detailed preparations, both SAI had to familiarise with the law environment and procedures of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and in Germany.
Based on an information analysis, we had made the selection of audit topics that we put on the audit programme.
Achieving efficiency and effectiveness in the administration of VAT is a long-term problem and individual countries (the EC Member States especially) are looking for an answer on how to improve the system, how to simplify VAT collection and make it more transparent.
We are convinced that the results of our audit may help not only to improve tax administrators´ work, but also serve as a basis for improving an international information exchange system.
Report on the Results of the Parallel Audit of the Administration of Value Added Tax in the Czech Republic and in the Federal Republic of Germany
Introduction
Audit number: (CZ) 06/27 (D) VIII 2 – 2005 – 1215
Subject of audit:
(CZ) Administration of value added tax following accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union
(D) Review of the administrative cooperation in the field of VAT according to the Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and the Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004
Objective of audit:
(CZ) The objective of the audit in the Czech Republic was to review the procedure used by financial authorities in administrating value added tax following integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter “EC”), connected with free movement of goods and services, and to review the use of the VIES, particularly monitoring the exercise of the right to exempt intraCommunity deliveries from value added tax.
(D) The objective of the audit was to review the system of intraCommunity VAT control with a special focus on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT according to the above mentioned regulations.
As a result of this, weaknesses should be reported and recommendations be developed to address the problems stated.
Value Added Tax Information Exchange System The audits were performed by the Supreme Audit Office, Czech Republic (hereinafter the “SAO”) and by the German Bundesrechnungshof (hereinafter “BRH”) in mutual cooperation on the basis of an agreement concluded between the two audit institutions on June 8, 2006.
The cooperation primarily concerned the review of selected commercial transactions between taxpayers from the Czech Republic (hereinafter “CR”) and from the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter “Germany”), use of information obtained via international cooperation between tax administrations and comparison of the VAT administration systems in the two countries.
A joint final report on the results of the audits was processed in the sense of European Directive No. 31 for implementing the INTOSAI audit standards.
The audited period covered the period from May 1, 2004 to December 31, 2005.
Summary of results and evaluation of parallel audits
Based on an agreement between the two SAI the parallel audit on the administration of VAT in the CR and Germany was carried out.
Besides the main point – exchange of information based on the Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and the Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004 – the audit covered other topics as for instance the registration of taxpayers, VAT returns and recapitulative statements that are closely linked with it.
Additionally, the legal situation in terms of international bus transportation of passengers and the comparison of certain statistical data were part of the audit.
By comparing the systems of administration of VAT in the two countries differences were found in the following areas:
1) Registration for VAT.
Whereas entrepreneurs in Germany are registered regardless of the volume of their turnover, in the CR the prime criterion (except others) for registration is exceeding of the turnover limit set down in the law on VAT.
In the CR, taxpayers are assigned one tax identification number only, which they also use in intra-Community transactions.
For VAT registration purposes in Germany taxpayers are assigned a tax number that serves only for business transactions within the German territory.
If German taxpayers intend to do intra-Community transactions, they have to apply for assignment of a special identification number, so-called VAT ID.
Since the different ways of registration cause problems, the conditions should be harmonised in the whole EC (see 4.1).
2) International bus transportation of passengers.
In the CR, the international bus transportation of passengers is exempt from VAT with the right for VAT deduction.
In Germany, the part of transportation that takes place in the German territory is subject to VAT.
At EC level, efforts should be undertaken to harmonise the situation, in the sense of article 393 of the Council Directive 2006/112/EC, on the common system of VAT (see 4.2).
3) VAT returns.
While in the CR taxpayers submit VAT returns only for particular taxable periods (month or quarter), taxpayers in Germany are obliged to submit preliminary VAT returns (monthly or quarterly) and after the end of a calendar year, they have to submit an annual VAT return.
In contrast to Czech taxpayers, taxpayers in Germany are obliged to submit preliminary VAT returns electronically.
Introducing the obligation to submit VAT returns electronically in the CR would increase the efficiency of the Czech tax administration (see 4.3).
4) Recapitulative statements.
Whereas taxpayers in the CR submit recapitulative statements to tax offices, in Germany taxpayers submit recapitulative statements to the CLO.
Therefore, tax offices in the CR have the data contained in recapitulative statements available immediately after their submission.
German tax offices have information from recapitulative statements available only after their processing at the CLO.
Combating VAT fraud requires updated information about intra-Community transactions as soon as possible.
The monthly submission of recapitulative statements would shorten the time lag between the date of the transaction and the update of VIES data.
Consequently, this would allow timely review of the taxation in the Member State of the acquirer (see 4.4).
For this purpose all Member States of the EC would have to introduce the same deadline for submission of recapitulative statement.
5) International exchange of information in the area of VAT.
On receiving a request for information, the Czech CLO observes compliance with the three-month deadline.
The German CLO does not follow up elapsed time.
As a result of this the German tax administration dealt with a significantly lower percentage of received requests within the set deadline.
Because of these problems the BRH recommended to the German CLO to introduce a steady reminding exercise (see 4.6).
6) Risk management.
Each of both Member States is developing its own risk management system (hereinafter “RMS”), that has its strengths and weaknesses.
The SAO and BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by only one Member State.
Successful criteria, components or approaches of a RMS have to be exchanged and implemented in each Member State of the EC, if not so fraudsters will choose that Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5.).
As part of cooperation, the two SAI reviewed selected cases of intra-Community transactions processed by tax entities in the CR and Germany.
Thirty-one cases of business transactions were reviewed jointly using the legal provisions of the CLO, where there were doubts about their realization, their proper treatment or suspicion of VAT fraud.
The SAI found that:
In some cases, tax offices made use of the information obtained via international exchange and have reassessed taxpayer’s VAT liability.
In those cases, taxpayers either unlawfully applied the right for exemption of supplies from VAT, or did not declare acquisition of goods in their VAT return.
In some cases, tax offices could not make use of the information obtained, because the information was incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used because of differing legal provisions in both Member States.
In some cases, the tax administration of another Member State refused to reply to a request for information.
Some cases were detected, where taxpayers wrongly declared business transactions in their recapitulative statements.
As a result of this, data in VIES were erroneous and therefore the tax administrators had to review those cases (see 6).
Audit procedure
Audit procedure in the CR
The audit was performed in the period from June 2006 to March 2007 by the Division II – Department of State Budget Incomes and by the territorial departments of Central Bohemia, North-Western Bohemia, Southern Bohemia Southern Moravia, Central Moravia and Northern Moravia.
The audited entities were: the Ministry of Finance (hereinafter the “MoF”) and 10 tax offices – the tax office in Humpolec, the tax office in Jihlava, the tax office in Kadaň, the tax office in Liberec, the tax office in Nymburk, the tax office in Otrokovice, the tax office for Prague 1, the tax office for Prague 4, the tax office in Sokolov and the tax office in Třinec.
The SAO Collegium approved the conclusions of this audit on April 23, 2007.
Audit procedure in Germany
The audit was performed in the period from July 2006 to February 2007 by the audit unit for indirect taxes and staff of the assigned regional audit offices in Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich.
It was part of the audit programme for 2006 and therefore announced to the Federal MoF in 2006.
After a test phase the audit started in the fourth quarter of 2006.
According to the cases selected by the BRH and later selected by the SAO, the BRH notified a number of federal states of the audit mission.
Besides interviews at the Federal MoF and the CLO the audit was conducted in the following federal states:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
Tax files of the following tax offices were included:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, München-Körperschaften, München II, IV und München V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nord und Hamburg für Großunternehmen, Hannover-Nord, Winsen-Luhe, Bonn-Innenstadt, Köln-Mitte, Köln-Porz, Köln-Süd, Sankt Augustin, Pirmasens, Bautzen, Chemnitz-Süd, Dresden II, Freiberg, Leipzig I und Zschopau.
Additionally, discussions were held with the tax offices Augsburg-Stadt, Aurich, Düsseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, Kelheim und Verden.
The audit findings were reported to the MoF in May 2007.
Cooperation of the two audit institutions
As part of preparing parallel audits, several meetings of representatives of the two audit institutions were held in the period prior to their commencement.
Participants in these meetings became acquainted with the organisation of the tax administrations, legislation on VAT and the VAT administration system in the two countries.
The subject matter of the testing phase was agreed at the meeting that was held in May 2006.
The results of the testing phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.
At this meeting, also a timetable was agreed for further procedure, and the following subjects for parallel audits were selected:
1. Registration of VAT payers.
2.
International passenger bus transportation – legislation in the CR and Germany.
3. International exchange of information, in particular the processing of requests for information and furthermore how the tax offices reviewed selected problem cases mentioned in the requests for information, and in the spontaneous information supplied between the CR and Germany.
4. VAT returns.
5.
Recapitulative statements.
6.
Statistical information on supply and acquisition of goods between the CR and the Germany.
7. VAT risk management.
At a meeting of the SAO and the BRH, held in December 2006, the two parties became acquainted with the audit procedure in the CR and Germany and discussed results achieved in the parallel audits.
A report on the results of the parallel audits of the administration of VAT between the CR and Germany was elaborated at the working meeting in July 2007.
4. Administration of value added tax in the CR and Germany
Registrace plátců k DPH
A) Taxpayers with their offi cial seat, place of business or commercial premises in the CR
Pursuant to Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on administration of taxes and fees (hereinafter “Act No. 337/1992 Coll.”) the term tax entity refers to a taxpayer, a taxable person and the legal successor of a natural or legal person that is a tax entity definedby law.
As of December 31, 2004, a total of 421,865 tax entities were registered for VAT in the CR.
The number of tax entities registered for VAT has increased to 457,590 by 1 December 2005.
A person obliged to pay tax, who has his official seat, place of business or commercial premises in the CR, whose turnover in the most recent 12 preceding consecutive calendar months exceeded the sum of CZK 1,000,000 (EUR 33,575) becomes a taxpayer on the 1st day of the third month following after the month in which he exceeded the registration limit (§ 94 (1) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., on value added tax; hereinafter “Act No. 235/2004 Coll.”).
This person is obliged to submit an application for registration within 15 days after the end of the month in which he exceeded the registration limit.
The current legislation does not permit registering a person obliged to pay tax retroactively in cases taxpayers exceed the legal term to submit the application for registration.
A person obliged to pay tax, who has his official seat, place of business or commercial premises in the CR, who performs taxable transactions or transactions exempt from VAT with the right to tax deduction, is obliged to register for VAT even if he does not exceed a turnover of CZK 1,000,000 (EUR 33,575), provided that he fulfils any of other conditions stated in the Act No. 235/2004 Coll.
A person obliged to pay tax, who has his official seat, place of business or commercial premises in the CR, who does not fulfil any of the conditions stated by the law, may apply for registration for VAT voluntarily.
When the application for registration is submitted to the competent local tax administrator the registration procedure pursuant to Act No. 337/1992 Coll. starts.
A voluntary VAT payer shall also state, in the application for registration for VAT, the date as of which he requests registration as a VAT payer.
The tax administrator shall verify the data communicated by the tax entity, i.e. the completed application for registration with all its annexes.
If he is in doubt as to the stated data, he shall request the tax entity to explain, supplement or document the data.
When the tax administrator has verified that the tax entity meets the conditions for registration, he shall issue a decision in the form of a certificate stating that the tax entity is registered and that it has been allocated a tax identification number (hereinafter the “ID”).
In the certificate the tax administrator shall state the date when the registration for VAT became effective and the periodicity of the tax period for VAT.
The taxable period is one calendar quarter unless the taxpayer’s turnover for the previous calendar year reached the amount of CZK 10,000,000 (EUR 335,750).
If the taxpayer’s turnover for the previous calendar year reached the amount of CZK 10,000,000 (EUR 335,750), the taxable period is one calendar month.
A taxpayer, whose turnover for the previous calendar year attained an amount of CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150), is entitled to choose a calendar month as the tax period and shall notify the tax administrator of this change.
The assignment of an ID in the certificate of registration is always constitutive in character.
The tax entity is obliged to state it in all communications (including payments) with the tax administrator, and in those cases stipulated by a special law (e.g. Act No. 235/2004 Coll., in drawing up tax documents).
The ID contains the code “CZ” and a basic part, consisting of a general identifier.
For natural persons, the general identifier is the birth certificate number or some other general identifier if so stipulated by a special law, and for a legal person, the general identifier is the business identification number (provisions of § 33 (12) of Act No. 337/1992 Coll.).
If the tax entity has not fulfilled its obligation in spite of being requested to do so by the tax administrator, the competent local tax administrator shall register it at his own initiative.
The registration proceeding results in the issuing a Certificate of Registration ex officio, which shall be delivered to the tax entity.
In the CR, a tax entity that has acquired authorisation for a business activity is assigned an ID at the moment of his first registration for any kind of tax.
The tax entity also uses the same ID when he is registered as a VAT payer.
According to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., which came into effect on January 1, 2005, in case of failure to comply with the registration obligation for VAT, the tax administrator may require that the taxable person has to pay up to 10% of the total revenues or income for taxable transactions that this person performed illegally without tax, for the period from the date on which he should have been registered as a taxpayer by law to the date on which he became a taxpayer on the basis of a decision by the tax administrator (provision of § 98 (1) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.).
Payment of this stipulated amount is considered to constitute payment of tax of § 98 (3) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.), i.e. it is not a penalty.
When the conditions laid down by law are met, the registration of a VAT payer may be cancelled for two reasons:
1)
Cancellation of the registration at the taxpayer’s request, i.e. primarily for reasons of the level of turnover, which does not attain the registration limit (§ 106 (1) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.).
Taxpayers may request cancellation of registration not earlier than 1 year after the date of legal force mentioned in the certificate of registration.
2) Cancellation of registration “ex officio” (§ 106 (7) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.), “if: a) the taxpayer did not perform any transactions without notification of the reason for this to the tax administrator for a period of 12 consecutive months, b) the taxpayer failed to fulfill his obligations pursuant to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., c) the taxpayer ceases to be a person obliged to pay taxes”.
B) Taxpayers without an official seat, place of business or commercial premises in the CR A person registered for taxes in another Member State, who does not have an official seat, place of business or commercial premises in the CR, or a foreign person obliged to pay tax, who performs a transaction which takes place in this country and who is a person obliged to report and pay taxes on such supply pursuant to § 108 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. (i.e. an “non-resident taxpayer”) becomes a taxpayer on the date of performing this transaction.
This person is obliged to submit an application for registration with the tax office for Prague 1 at the latest on the date of performance of the supply.
In the application for registration, he is obliged to report all VAT IDs that he was assigned to in other Member States or in a third country.
If a “non-resident” taxpayer submits an application for registration later than on the date of performance of the first taxable transaction in the CR, the tax office for Prague 1 shall register him retroactively as, pursuant to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., the tax entity became a VAT payer on the date of performance of the first taxable transaction in the CR.
In cases of retroactive registration, the tax office for Prague 1 shall request from tax entities a document that the supply was performed (invoices or explanatory letters).
If a “non-resident” tax entity requests registration in the CR, prior to performance of the first taxable transaction the tax office for Prague 1 shall request submission of agreements that the performance of the transaction will occur.
As of December 31, 2004, a total of 473 “non-resident” taxpayers were registered at the tax office for Prague 1, of which 124 were taxpayers from Germany; as of December 31, 2005, a total of 951 “non-resident” taxpayers were registered, of which 233 were taxpayers from Germany.
Pursuant to the provisions of § 106 (9) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., tax administrators shall be authorised to cancel the registration of an “non-resident” taxpayer as of January 31 of the following calendar year if this taxpayer does not incur any obligation to report and pay tax.
The SAO found that, if a “non-resident” taxpayer submitted a tax return abroad for postal transport on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the legal requirements of the date for submitting a tax return, the tax office often has not yet received it by 31 January.
In cases where these facts, decisive for the possibility of cancelling registration, are known by the tax office later than 31 January, it is not possible to cancel the registration for VAT for the “non-resident” taxpayer in the CR in the given calendar year.
Registration of taxpayers in Germany
Due to the legal provisions in the German fiscal code (§§ 137, 138 Abgabenordnung, hereinafter “AO”) anybody who performs a business is obliged to inform the municipality and/or the tax office in charge.
The deadline for submitting the information is one month after the start of the business.
The municipality conveys the information to the tax authorities.
If the tax authority finds out a going but unregistered business the competent tax office is able to register the taxpayer ex officio – even retroactively.
Taxpayers in Germany, both being resident or non-resident, are legally obliged to register for VAT whenever they fulfil the criteria set forth in § 2 of the German VAT law (hereinafter “UStG).
This does not depend on the volume of turnover produced.
A voluntary registration does not exist in Germany.
For entrepreneurs who are resident abroad special tax offices exist.
For instance for those who have their seat in the CR the tax office Chemnitz-Süd is responsible.
As of 30 April 2004 a total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered by the tax office Chemnitz-Süd; as of 1 March 2006 a total of 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered.
The BRH found that those special tax offices frequently denied the registration of so called quasi-dependent freelancers with a residence in the new eastern Member States of the EC.
Since after joining the EC the labour permits for employees of the ten new European Member States are limited, those freelancers tried to avoid these limits by starting a business.
These businesses do not fulfil the criteria for entrepreneurs as set in § 2 UStG because they are usually dependent on a sole employer who determines their labour time and the way of doing their labour.
In order to get registered the entrepreneur has to complete a questionnaire of the competent tax office, in which he has to give information about the company and the activities performed.
The questionnaire is a standard form that is binding for all tax offices in Germany.
It is processed either in special units of the tax office or in the general units that are responsible for the assessment of taxpayers.
With the help of this form a risk assessment of the individual taxpayer is carried out before the tax office issues a tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions follows specific rules:
First three figures provide the information which tax office is in charge of, the subsequent three (or four) give information about which department in the tax office is responsible, the next five (or four) are for classifying taxpayers whereas the last one is always a check digit.
If an entrepreneur intends to participate in intra-Community trade, he needs a VAT ID in order to receive tax-exempt intraCommunity supplies.
A VAT ID is granted by the CLO upon application if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany and has a VAT number.
The VAT ID will be assigned automatically by the CLO when taxpayers declare intra-Community deliveries in their VAT returns.
The structure of the VAT ID is the country code (DE) followed by a string of nine numbers.
An entrepreneur can be deregistered: 1. On application (for instance when he gave up his business) after all the administrative work is done (assessments for all business years) and 2. in case the tax administration realises that he no longer carries out a business.
Usually the validity of the VAT ID is aligned with the validity of the VAT number.
The tax offices have to inform the CLO about the cancellation of the VAT number so that the CLO can end the validity of the VAT ID in those cases.
According to German VAT law (§ 19 (1) UStG) resident taxpayers are not obliged to pay VAT in case 1. the turnover plus respective VAT of the previous calendar year did not exceed the amount of EUR 17,500 and 2. is not likely to exceed the amount of EUR 50,000 in the following year.
The so-called „Kleinunternehmer“ (small entrepreneurs) are not allowed to invoice other entrepreneurs for VAT and are not entitled to deduct input tax.
Though they are not obliged to pay VAT small entrepreneurs have to be registered by the tax office and have to submit an annual VAT return.
A small entrepreneur can declare the non-application of § 19 (1) UStG.
This declaration is binding for the following five years.
He is then allowed to invoice VAT and to deduct input tax.
Non-resident taxpayers may appoint a fiscal representative (§ 22a UStG).
The precondition for this is that they are involved in tax exempt transactions only and are not entitled to deduct input tax.
The fiscal representative fulfils the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur so that he does not need to register for VAT.
The invoices have to mention that fiscal representation is applied.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation is different in both countries.
Whereas in Germany entrepreneurs are registered independent of their turnover volume, in the CR, the first criteria (besides other) for registration is the excess of the limit set forth in the VAT law.
If a tax entity does not exceed the set limit, it has an option to ask for voluntary registration.
The registration process is standardised in Germany but differences may occur because of varying organisational patterns in the federal states.
In the CR, a taxpayer is assigned a tax identification number at the time of his first registration for any tax.
In case taxpayers register for VAT, they use the same ID also in intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, a taxpayer registering for VAT is assigned a tax number serving only for transactions within the territory of Germany.
If the German taxpayer intends to do intra-Community transactions, he has to ask for assignment of a special identification number, a so-called VAT ID.
Both the SAO and the BRH found the German two-stage system of registration could cause a lot of misunderstandings in other Member States such as the CR that allocates one single identification number for both national VAT registration and registration for intra-Community transactions.
On the other hand, the two-stage system permits the retroactive (national) registration in cases where taxpayers refuse to inform the municipality or the competent tax office about his business.
This retroactive registration ensures the proper VAT assessment of previous assessment periods, especially an exact estimation of a VAT liability.
Since the different ways of registration cause problems, the conditions should be harmonised in the whole EC.
German Parliament recently decided to establish a tax identification number (hereinafter TIN).
The Federal Finance Office will allocate the TIN after the birth of a natural person.
This TIN will be valid for the whole life of a natural person resident in Germany.
If a natural person starts a business the competent tax office will apply for an economic TIN that will be used as a VAT ID.
So in future there should be no time lag between the national registration of a taxpayer and the allocation of the VAT ID.
The work to implement an IT medium to administrate the TINs has not been finished until now.
International passenger bus transportation
Legislation in the CR
Pursuant to the provisions of § 70 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., the transportation of passengers between the individual Member States and also between the Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT in the CR, with the right for tax deduction, as from May 1, 2004.
This transportation is exempt from VAT even if performed by entrepreneurs who are registered for taxes in other Member States or a foreign person obliged to pay tax.
In this respect, return transport is considered to be a separate transport.
If “non-resident” tax entities do not perform any other economic activity in the CR except for international passenger bus transport, they are not obliged to register in the CR as VAT payers.
International passenger transport was exempted from VAT in the CR on the basis of the Act on Accession of the CR, Annex No. V, Chap. 5 (1) (b), where it is stated that:
“For the purposes of applying Article 28(3)(b) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Czech Republic may maintain an exemption from value added tax on international transport of passengers, referred to in point 17 of Annex F to the Directive, until the condition set out in Article 28 (4) of the Directive is fulfilled or for as long as the same exemption is applied by any of the present Member States, whichever is the earlier.”
Legislation in Germany
According to Article 46 of the Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 as implemented into § 3b (1) UStG the place of the supply of transport of passengers is the place where the route takes place.
So the German taxation does not make a distinction between a national and an international cross-border transport of passengers.
Only the part of the transport occurring on German territory, is a taxable supply of transport in Germany.
Also the German taxation does not distinguish between resident and non-resident taxpayers.
If a non-resident taxpayer transports passengers through Germany the part of the route in Germany is also considered as a taxable supply of transport.
The non-resident taxpayer has to announce his intention to supply the transport of passengers to the tax office in charge before he accomplishes his services in Germany.
The tax office registers the non-resident taxpayer for taxation (compare 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for any bus or coach that is named in the taxpayer’s announcement.
The taxpayer has to declare his taxable supplies of transport in a German VAT return.
As of 1 March 2006, the tax office Chemnitz-Süd registered 741 Czech taxpayers whose business was the transport of passengers.
If the transport of passengers is supplied to a resident taxable person for VAT, the non-resident taxpayer does not have to pay VAT to the tax office by himself.
Instead of him the resident acquirer of the services has to pay VAT to the tax office and the invoiced net amount to the non-resident taxpayer; this process is known as reverse charge and consistent with Article 196 of the Council Directive 2006/112/EC.
Apart from the announcement of a non-resident taxpayer and his VAT return the German tax administration has several means to assess the accurate declaration of taxable supplies of transport of passengers:
Mobile control groups of the customs authority audit the certificates of foreign-licensed busses that are used to transport passengers through Germany.
After each audit the mobile control groups send an inspection note to the tax office in charge.
If the bus driver lacks a valid certificate the mobile control group is authorised to demand the VAT from the bus driver before he continues the transport.
The non-resident taxpayer can deduct this paid VAT from the tax calculated in his VAT return.
If the tax office has doubts about the accuracy of a VAT return it can announce an audit that has to take place in the tax office or it can use the means of administrative cooperation that are named in the Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 (see 4.6).
Even if the non-resident taxpayer declines the payment of the lawfully stated VAT, the tax office can ask for the administrative cooperation of Council Directive 76/308/EEC.
To review a non-resident taxpayer’s VAT return or the fulfilment of his obligations, the BRH considered all these means of administrative cooperation as too labour-intensive compared to the small amounts of VAT that have to be paid for taxable supplies of transport of passengers.
Especially an audit of a non-resident taxpayer’s accounting leads to disproportional costs for both taxpayers and tax administration.
The latter has to audit the foreign accounting that does not only mean to understand the foreign language but to also know the foreign accounting standards.
So this audit is likely to take more time than an audit of a resident taxpayer, yet the audit is restricted to those passenger transports, that take place in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident taxpayer has not only to accept the audit rights of his national tax administration but also audits of other Member States wherever he transports passengers.
Moreover, for each Member State in that only one supply of transport of passengers takes place, taxpayers have to fulfil any duties of taxation in all of these Member States, respectively in all different languages and using all tax forms of these EC Member States.
So the actual taxation of crossborder transport of passengers causes unreasonable bureaucratic costs.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation in both countries is different.
In the CR, the transport of passengers between the individual Member States of the EC and also between the Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT with the right for tax deduction, on the basis of the Act on Accession of the CR.
In Germany, the part of the transport, that takes place within the German territory, is a taxable transaction.
If a non-resident taxpayer provides such transport for the first time, he is obliged to announce it to a competent tax office in advance.
The tax office registers taxpayers and taxpayers have to declare the taxable portion of transport in a tax return in Germany.
Applying the law in Germany is very time-consuming.
At least three of four Czech taxpayers registered in the tax office Chemnitz-Süd do their business in the transport of passengers.
Compared to the efforts required tax revenue is rather low.
The Member States – that levy VAT in accordance to Article 46 of the Council directive 2006/112/EC of November 28th, 2006, on the common system of VAT – are burdened with time-consuming duties without a financially sensible goal.
To avoid the disproportional costs to assess the VAT, the supplies of cross-border transport of passengers should be taxed in one Member State only.
This could be the state where the transport begins or where the supplier is resident.
Such taxation would require a modification of the Council directive 2006/112/EC.
VAT returns
Submitting and processing of VAT returns in the CR
A taxpayer is obliged to submit a VAT return on a form prescribed by the MoF within 25 days after the end of the taxable period, even if he has not incurred a tax liability, unless the law stipulates otherwise.
The actual tax liability falls due within the deadline for submitting the VAT return, with the exception of tax assessed in connection with import of goods pursuant to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., where the due date for the taxes is stipulated by the customs regulations.
If a returnable overpayment occurs as a consequence of excessive deduction, it is returned to the taxpayer without request within 30 days after assessing the excessive deduction.
The deadline is not applied in cases, where the tax administrator commences tax proceedings concerning taxpayer’s tax liability.
In accordance with § 73 (11) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., the right to deduct input tax may be exercised in a regular VAT return at the latest for the last taxable period of the calendar year in which the right to tax deduction could be exercised.
After expiry of this deadline, the right to deduct input tax may further be exercised within 3 years after the end of the tax period in which the right to tax deduction could first have been exercised.
However, this is possible only through submission of an additional VAT return.
An amendment to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., effective from January 1, 2005, permits submission of an additional VAT return only for the period when the right to tax deduction could first have been exercised.
A taxpayer is obliged to submit an additional VAT return if a) the sum of the corrections increases the tax liability, b) he performs corrections in which the last known tax liability does not change, but only information formerly stated by the tax entity is changed, c) he corrects the rate and amount of taxes pursuant to § 49 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.
A taxpayer may submit an additional VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces his tax liability.
The taxpayer is obliged to submit the additional VAT return by the end of the following month after determination of these facts.
A VAT return may be submitted in electronic form either via the Internet or on a technical data carrier.
Submission by Internet may be performed as a submission with a data report attached with a certified electronic signature or as a submission without attaching a data report with a certified electronic signature.
If a data report is not attached with a certified electronic signature, it must also be submitted in written form, i.e. delivery of the computer file to the tax administrator (e-form).
The VAT return contains separate lines related to values of intra-Community supply/acquisition of goods.
Values of acquisition of services are reported on special lines of the VAT return.
Some lines are used for the purpose of primary automated controls as part of the ATIS system.
The value of goods supplied to other EC Member States for entrepreneurs registered for tax in other Member States is compared to the data given in the recapitulative statements submitted by Czech taxpayers.
The value of goods acquired from other Member States from entrepreneurs registered for tax in other Member States is compared with the values obtained via the VIES system from recapitulative statements of taxpayers from other Member States of the EC.
Under the ATIS system, a test of the trustworthiness of VAT returns takes place at the tax office.
This test occurs automatically as the VAT return cannot be assessed without performance of the test.
The test of the trustworthiness includes a calculation of the trustworthiness criteria and an evaluation of the risky types of VAT returns.
Pursuant to the Provisions of § 37 (1) of Act No. 337/1992 Coll., the tax office may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) on a person who does not meet his obligations of a non-monetary nature following from this or a special tax law or imposed in a decision pursuant to this law.
Automated tax information system, which the tax office uses for technical support for administration of taxes.
The SAO found that the tax offices mostly did not make use of the possibility of imposing a fine on taxpayers for failure to submit a VAT return.
Submitting and processing of VAT returns in Germany
In Germany we differentiate between preliminary monthly or quarterly VAT returns and the annual VAT return.
Those taxpayers who are obliged to submit preliminary VAT returns nevertheless have to submit an annual VAT return.
Even small entrepreneurs who are not obliged to pay VAT have to submit an annual VAT return.
Taxpayers generally have to submit quarterly VAT returns by the 10th day of the month following the quarter in which VAT arises (§ 18 (2) UStG).
However, if the VAT liability exceeded EUR 6,136 in the previous calendar year or in case of a newly established business the entrepreneur is obliged to submit monthly VAT returns by the 10th day following the respective month.
The taxpayer may also choose to submit monthly VAT returns if there was a refund in the preceding year, which exceeded EUR 6,136 (§ 18 (2a) UStG).
VAT returns need not be submitted if the annual VAT did not exceed EUR 512.
The corresponding VAT liability has to be paid by the 10th day of the month following the tax period in which the VAT arose.
A refund may lead to a more detailed investigation by the tax authorities.
Deadlines (by law) for the processing of VAT returns and for the refund of excessive VAT do not exist.
To achieve the refund in time, it is possible to offer a security for the repayable amount.
It is a basic principle to process VAT returns and refunds promptly.
Under German VAT law this time limit may be extended (§ 18 (6) UStG).
Such extension has to be applied for separately.
Taxpayers may submit VAT returns and pay the corresponding VAT liabilities one month later, provided that in case of monthly returns a special advance payment is made.
This payment is balanced against the December VAT liability.
Whenever a mistake is detected a corrected VAT return has to be submitted by the entrepreneur.
An “additional” VAT return does not exist.
Once the annual VAT return which has to be submitted until 31 May of the following calendar year is filed with the tax office the entrepreneur cannot correct a wrong preliminary VAT return but his wrong annual VAT return.
A correction of this VAT return to the advantage or disadvantage of the taxpayer is possible during the following four years after the year in which the first annual VAT return was submitted.
As a rule, after these four years an annual VAT return may be corrected only in cases of tax fraud or tax evasion.
Taxpayers are obliged to submit the preliminary VAT returns electronically.
The tax offices to avoid undue hardships can apply exceptions to this rule.
Submission of the annual VAT return is possible on paper or via Internet with or without certification.
If done without certification taxpayers have to submit the return once more on paper with their personal signature.
In cases of non-submission of VAT returns the tax administration is authorised to make a rough estimate of the taxpayer’s turnover.
In cases of delayed submission an additional penalty charge can be levied on the taxpayer (the maximum is 10 % of the tax to be paid or EUR 25,000).
During a previous audit the BRH found that the tax offices frequently do not impose this default fine.
In the other cases the tax offices imposed the penalty the amount was assessed inconsistently and highhandedly.
So the default fine misses its goal to shorten the average delay particularly in the submission of the annual VAT return.
The tax return contains separate lines related to values of intra-Community supply/acquisition of goods.
Values of acquisition of services are reported on special lines of the VAT return.
Non-taxable transactions have to be declared in a separate line of the VAT return.
VAT returns that are submitted on paper have to be recorded either via scanner or by special staff.
The data of electronically submitted VAT returns are available to the tax administrator immediately.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
After all data are logged in the system the risk management is applied to it and all cases meeting certain criteria are selected.
Those VAT returns chosen have to be checked by the tax administrator based on the inspection note produced by the system (see 5.2).
Although the tax administration has to estimate roughly the VAT the taxpayer has to pay, the estimated tax has to be as exact as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the CR, taxpayers submit VAT returns until 25 days after the end of a taxable period.
Depending on taxpayer’s turnover, taxable period is either the calendar quarter orcalendar month.
In Germany, taxpayers submit preliminary VAT returns, depending on their tax liability in the previous year either until 10 days after the end of the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
By 31 May of the following year, taxpayers are obliged to submit an annual VAT return.
The obligation to submit an annual VAT return has some pros and cons:
+ after the expiration of the calendar year taxpayers are able to correct the errors in the monthly preliminary VAT returns by submission of one single VAT return;
– if taxpayers correct their statements concerning intraCommunity transactions the correction cannot be related to a reporting period of the recapitulative statement;
– the federal states compare the data of VIES about intraCommunity acquisitions of German taxpayers not until the annual VAT returns are usually processed.
In accordance with the registration (see 4.1.3) German entrepreneurs are obliged to submit an annual VAT return independently from the amount of their turnover.
This duty enables the German tax authority to check the maximum turnover limit for small entrepreneurs.
Furthermore the tax office in charge is able to compare the annual VAT return with those for direct taxes and with the year-end accounts.
In the CR, tax administrators are able to determine the volume of taxpayer’s turnover only from submitted income tax return.
In contrast to the CR, taxpayers in Germany are obliged to submit VAT returns electronically.
Introducing the obligation to submit VAT returns in the CR electronically would increase the efficiency of Czech tax administration.
Recapitulative statements
Submitting and processing of recapitulative statements in the CR
Pursuant to the provisions of § 102 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., recapitulative statements (hereinafter “RS”) are submitted by a taxpayer who supplied goods to another Member State to a person registered for taxes in the other Member State.
Information on the value of goods supplied is always stated in the RS in Czech currency and is classified according to individual tax entities with specification of their VAT IDs, under which they are registered in their country.
Data on services are not provided in the RS.
Taxpayers submit an RS for monthly and quarterly taxable periods for each calendar quarter to the 25th day after its termination to the competent local tax office.
Erroneous data are corrected in the corrected RS within 15 days after identifying the errors.
Erroneous data stated in the RS are always replaced by the data stated in the corrected RS.
Similar to tax returns, taxpayers may also submit RS in electronic form.
If a taxpayer does not submit a RS or corrected RS and was obliged to do so pursuant to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., the tax administrator shall invite him to submit them and shall simultaneously advise him about the consequences of not submitting the RS or corrected RS, i.e. that in case of a failure to comply with obligations of a non-monetary nature, the tax administrator is authorised to repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) pursuant to § 37 of Act No. 337/1992 Coll.
The SAO found that the tax offices frequently did not make use of the possibility of imposing a fine on taxpayers failing to comply with their legal obligations.
Particularly in relation to submitting RS, tax entities are not adequately motivated to comply with their obligations as a failure to submit RS does not affect their VAT liability.
Pursuant to § 102 (5) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., the tax administrator is obliged to verify data in the RS or corrected RS, to eliminate any lack of clarity and use the data for determining tax liability.
Where the data in the RS and the data in the relevant VAT returns (taxpayers with monthly taxable period) or relevant VAT return (taxpayers with quarterly taxable period) do not correspond, the tax administrator should verify the accuracy of tax liability stated in the VAT return.
The tax entity eliminates erroneous information in the RS through submission of a corrected RS at its own initiative or it may be invited to do so.
The tax administrator shall correct data on supply of goods to other Member States in the ATIS system if:
– if taxpayers can not justify the data stated in the RS (or corrected RS) and therefore correct them by submission of a corrected RS,
– the tax administrator demonstrated that the data stated by taxpayers in the RS or corrected RS are not accurate.
Corrections entered by the tax administrator without the submission of a corrected RS by these taxpayers shall not replace a submission by the tax entity, but only adjust the data in the VIES database so that it is up to date, complete and precise.
Data from the RS are sent to the relevant Member States.
Solely the national financial administrative authority, designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the area of VAT may send and receive this data. This is the CLO (in CR this function is fulfilled by the MoF, International Cooperation in VAT Administration Department (CLO)).
O_MCTL is an automatic report that the CLO obtains from other Member States.
It contains all the erroneous VAT IDs entered in the sent RS lines.
If the erroneous VAT ID is used on some of the transferred common lines of the RS or corrected RS, an entry is made in the table of the erroneous VAT IDs.
The table contains a “Notification of doubts on VAT ID”.
The tax administrator verifies the data and records the result of verification in the system.
Concerning acquisition of goods from another Member State, taxpayers are obliged to declare VAT and state the acquisition value in separate lines of the VAT return.
Selected cases of discrepancies in the value of the acquired goods declared by Czech taxpayers in their VAT returns and the value of the supplied goods as entered by taxpayers from another Member State in their RS, are sent from the CLO to the tax office for review.
The tax administrators are obliged to investigate discrepancies.
Three situations can occur:
a) The value declared by a Czech taxpayer in the relevant lines of the VAT return is lower than the value of the supply declared by taxpayers from the EC.
In this case, the tax administrator verifies the accuracy of the data.
b) The amount of the difference equals 0.
This situation can occur either through a change in data in the EC (the foreign supplier corrects his RS) or through a change in data in the VAT return (the Czech tax entity submits an additional VAT return by itself in the meantime).
In this case, the tax administrator is free to decide whether he nonetheless verifies the accuracy of the data in the VAT return.
c) The value of goods acquired from other Member States, which the Czech taxpayer entered in the relevant lines of the VAT return, is higher than the value of the supplied goods declared by EC taxpayers.
Here again, the tax administrator is free to decide whether he verifies the accuracy of the data.
After the verifying the difference and clarifying the underlying reasons the tax administrator enters the results of the verification into ATIS.
The results of verification are transferred to the CLO.
The number of cases sent from the CLO to tax offices for review for the individual quarters of 2005 is illustrated in graph No. 1 (Note: source: MoF).
Graph No. 1 above documents that the number of cases sent from the CLO to tax offices for the individual quarters of 2005 decreased.
There was a substantial decrease in the number of the 4th quarter of 2005, because the CLO increased the minimal financial limit, i.a., with respect to the possibility of sending a request for information to the other EC Member States.
Discrepancies between data in the VAT returns and data from the EC need not always to be caused by an error on the part of the domestic taxpayer.
It may also be attributable to an error on the part of the EC taxpayer or an error that occurred because some types of supplies may be entered in the RS differently in the individual EC Member States.
The most common reasons for discrepancies in the values of reported transactions revealed at the audited tax offices are given in Table No. 1.
Submitting and processing of recapitulative statements in Germany
Entrepreneurs who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EC Member States or participate in triangular transactions are required to file quarterly RS in that the intra-Community deliveries per recipient are listed (§ 18a (1) UStG).
The RS must be filed until the 10th day of the month following the respective calendar quarter.
If extension is granted for the preliminary VAT returns, this also applies to the RS.
The RS needs to be delivered to the CLO.
Starting from 1 January 2007 they have to be delivered electronically.
The competent tax offices may grant exceptions to certain taxpayers to avoid undue hardships.
In cases where taxpayers realise that the RS was wrong they are obliged to submit a corrected statement within one month.
If taxpayers failed to submit an RS the CLO will initiate a procedure to ensure submission of the statement.
This procedure includes: – first reminder – second reminder linked with the threat of a fine and – imposing the fine.
Although the German Fiscal Code permits imposing a fine up to EUR 25,000 (§ 329 AO), the CLO assesses fines in three steps in the amounts of EUR 125, 250 and 500.
Besides this, § 26a (1) Nr. 5 UStG stipulates that taxpayers act illegally if they intentionally or carelessly do not issue a RS properly, state it incompletely or not in time or if they do not amend a RS at all or not in time.
This offence can be sanctioned by a fine up to EUR 5,000.
Data on intra-Community supplies cannot be entered into VIES by the tax office because processing of RS is an exclusive task of the CLO.
RS data are stored in the system of the CLO only.
So the figures of the RS are visible to the tax office only after their processing at the CLO.
The deadlines for processing RS are set forth in the Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
Data of the RS have to be stored within three months after the respective calendar quarter.
In case of erroneous VAT IDs in the RS of German taxpayers the CLO gets an O_MCTL from the other Member State.
The CLO contacts the entrepreneur and asks for the accurate data.
If the CLO does not succeed in getting the correct information the case is handed over to the competent tax offices.
It is now their turn to ask for the correct data.
The BRH found out that most of the entrepreneurs corrected the VAT ID on request of the CLO.
However, the reminder, the threat and the assessment of three additional fines take too much time in cases where a taxpayer may be involved in a cross-border carousel fraud.
Those cases that were finally reported to the competent tax offices, were usually completed within one or two months.
The tax office refused the tax exemption of the declared intra-Community supplies in 73 % of these cases.
If taxpayers submitted the right VAT ID the tax office asked them to submit a corrected RS to the CLO, because the tax offices are not able to correct the VIES data by themselves.
The BRH found that neither the tax offices nor the CLO monitored the submission of the corrected RS. So often taxpayers did not comply with the request.
Due to the fact that the CLO does not have access to the VAT return data a comparison of the data on supply of goods declared in the VAT return and in the RS does not take place before submitting those data to the CLO of the other Member States.
This check is possible only for the tax offices and is usually made when preparing a VAT audit.
Data received from other Member States are processed in the CLO.
Incorrect VAT IDs are selected and submitted to the respective Member States.
The data are used for purposes of acquisition control in the tax offices.
As soon as they are in the system the CLO checks them against the data of previous calendar quarters.
In cases that comply with certain criteria (see 5.2) control information is created and sent to the competent tax offices.
This is done permanently whereas a compilation of the acquisition data for all taxpayers is created later and submitted to the tax offices.
The RMS installed for the assessment procedure then checks those data against the data of intraCommunity acquisitions.
This system completely covers those entrepreneurs, who are not fully entitled to VAT deduction.
Comparison and evaluation
In the CR, taxpayers that delivered intra-Community supplies to a person registered for VAT in another Member State, submit a RS within 25 days after the end of the calendar quarter to a competent local tax office.
Tax offices process RS and transmit the data to the CLO.
Values of intra-Community supplies, stated by taxpayers in the RS, are compared by the tax offices with the values of intraCommunity supplies, stated by the same taxpayers in VAT returns.
Results of the comparison are used as part of assessment proceedings.
In Germany, taxpayers that performed intra-Community supplies are obliged to submit quarterly RS within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter.
Taxpayers submit the RS to the CLO, as from 1 January 2007 electronically.
For tax offices, the data from RS are at disposal only after their processing at the CLO.
Taxpayers both from the CR and Germany declare in RS only supplies of goods.
Rendering of services is not stated in RS.In contrast to the Czech tax offices the German tax offices are not able to correct wrong lines in a submitted RS by themselves.
Owing to this limited access to the German VIES data wrong VAT IDs were not corrected even if taxpayers communicated the right VAT ID to the tax office.
The German tax administration does not compare the data of intra-Community supplies that are declared in a German taxpayer’s VAT return with his RS.
Differences between the data of these two returns are usually not detected before the German CLO submits the VIES data to other Member States.
Considering these findings of the BRH it is obvious that a comparison would increase the reliability of the submitted VIES data.
Data on supply of goods for the Czech taxpayers, delivered from other Member States, are compared in the CR with data on acquisition of goods as stated in the Czech taxpayers´ VAT returns.
Comparison is made by CLO separately for each calendar quarter.
The most important deviations are transmitted to the tax offices for review.
Unlike the Czech tax administration, the German one does not generally check the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.
Such a general verification is carried out only for taxpayers, which are not fully entitled to deduct input VAT.
Furthermore, the German tax administration checks the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other taxpayers only if the RMS produces an inspection note or if taxpayers are selected for an audit at any rate.
This process disburdens the tax offices to clarify the reasons of any difference.
On the other hand the disclosure of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
Combating carousel fraud requires continually updated information about intra-Community acquisitions.
The current system of RS, especially VIES, provides the tax authorities with information which may even be six months old.
This time lag could be shortened by up to four months if taxpayers had to submit a monthly RS.
The monthly submission would not be a considerable increase in bureaucratic costs because most of the taxpayers in CR and Germany are obliged to submit monthly VAT returns anyway – and the RS do not require any further information than the VAT return.
To avoid any bureaucratic costs the submission of the RS could be connected with the submission of VAT returns.
However, an obligation to submit monthly RS would cause more temporary mismatches between the declaration of intra-Community supplies and intra-Community acquisitions and it would increase the data ﬂows between CLO.
In 2006 the German Federal Government considered the general institution of monthly RS.
The implementation failed because of doubts of the federal states.
They feared that a monthly submission of VIES data to CLOs of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In fact – if the obligation of monthly RS and the monthly submission of VIES data should be effective – a monthly update of VIES would require a European standard of monthly RS.
Statistical information on supply and acquisition of goods between the CR and Germany
As regards foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the CR.
The total quantities of intra-Community transactions in goods between the CR and Germany are set forth in Table No. 2.
The two SAI requested data on the number of erroneous IDs or VAT IDs contained in the O_MCTL reports transferred between the CR and Germany for the individual quarterly periods reviewed.
These data are contained in the following tables.
They show significant differences.
The reason of these differences may be a different basis for calculation of numbers of O_MCTL reports.
While the Czech CLO relates its numbers to the respective calendar quarter, for which RS were submitted, the German CLO relates its numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O_MCTL report was received.
International exchange of information at level 3
International exchange of information in the CR: Procedure
International exchange of information helps tax administrators to obtain information from other Member States related to intra-Community business transactions and the taxpayers who carried out these transactions.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 218/92 makes a distinction between two basic categories of exchange of information: exchange of information on request and exchange of information without a prior request.
International exchange of information on request is performed through a “request for information” (hereinafter “RFI”) using the standardised SCAC form.
Tax administrators in the CR communicate their RFI or answer a delivered RFI via the financial directorate to the CLO, which provides for translation of information entered in the standardised SCAC forms into the foreign language and their sending to other Member States.
The CLO also provides for receipt of RFI from other Member States and answers to sent RFI, their translation into Czech and distribution to the competent local tax administrators for processing.
Art. 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 stipulates that the maximum period of time for processing RFI is 3 months from receipt of the request.
All RFI submitted during the audited period between the CR and Germany were subjected to SAO audit.
Out of the total number of 94 RFI received in the CR from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were processed within the set three-month deadline; a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) were processed after this deadline and, in the remaining 1 case, an answer had not been sent to Germany by the time of the SAO audit.
More detailed information on the periods of time within which answers to RFI received from Germany were sent from the CR is contained in Graph No. 2.
Of the total number of 335 RFI sent from the CR to Germany, an answer was sent in 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) within the set three-month deadline, a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) of requests were answered after this deadline and, in 19 cases, an answer had not been sent from Germany at the time of the SAO audit (in the remaining one case, it was not possible to identify on the basis of the data provided when the answer was delivered from Germany).
More detailed information on the periods of time within which answers to RFI were furnished from Germany to the CR is contained in Graph No. 3.
The percentages of the values of intra-Community transactions stated in RFI submitted between the CR and Germany are disclosed in Graph No. 4.
The above graph illustrates that the value of business transactions reviewed through RFI was most frequently in the range above EUR 60,000.
International exchange of information without a prior request occurs either by means of automatic or structured-automatic exchange of information, or by spontaneous exchange of information.
Tax administrators from other Member States often received information that might be important for VAT administration without a previous request.
In the CR, all the information is collected at the CLO.
Information is transferred electronically between the individual Member States.
“Automatic exchange” pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 refers to systematic communication of prespecified information to other Member States, without a prior request and at preset regular intervals.
“Structured-automatic exchange” refers to systematic communication of pre-specified information to other Member States without a previous request as soon as the relevant information is available.
The CR provides other Member States with information on supply of new means of transport via automatic exchange.
This information is available for the tax administrator from the form Report of the supply of a new means of transport pursuant to § 19 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. and from a copy of the issued tax document.
In processing this form, the tax administrator enters the necessary data in a specially created template and immediately submits this to the contact employee at the financial directorate, where these data are collected and submitted to the CLO for subsequent processing. Then they are transferred to other Member States within a set deadline, i.e. by the latest within two months after the end of the quarter in which these data were available.
The CR also provides the other Member States with information on mail-order sales, which are exempt from VAT in the Member State of origin, information on operations within the EC that seem unauthorised and information on potential “missing traders”.
Such information is sent to other Member States via spontaneous exchange using a SCAC form.
International exchange of information in Germany: Procedure
In Germany the local tax office in charge initiates both requests for information and spontaneous information.
The tax office sends the completed form SCAC 2004 by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which transmits the SCAC forms to the foreign CLO.
The tax offices are instructed to write their requests for information or their spontaneous information only in German; even the used SCAC form is monolingual.
Half of the German requests for information checked by the BRH were sent to ensure the taxation of an intra-Community acquisition in the other Member State and prove the tax exemption of the intra-Community supply from Germany to the other Member State respectively.
When the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it checks the amount of supplies mentioned in the request for the minimum threshold of EUR 15,000.
If there is no adequate reason for the request, the German CLO declines any request for an amount below this threshold.
Furthermore, the German CLO translates the free texts of the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)] if these texts are neither in German nor English.
To answer the requests for information the CLO sends the request to the tax office in charge referring to the 3-month-time-limit.
There are no other deadlines set for processing the request on specific organisational levels of the tax administration.
Although the German CLO has the technical conditions to monitor the elapsed time limits, it lacks the staff capacity to remind the tax offices of answering the incomplete requests for information.
The tax offices get the information required by sending a letter to the taxpayers or by conducting an audit.
The auditors usually chose between two different types of audits: A special VAT audit which covers any taxable process of a period of some months or a so called VAT inspection which can cover only one transaction which has been done recently.
This short and ﬂexible kind of audit does not require any notification of the taxpayer and it has been of merits to investigate a single taxable transaction.
In the context of the automatic exchange without a prior request Germany provides other Member States with information – about VAT IDs granted to entrepreneurs who are resident in other EC Member States, – about the refund of input tax to those entrepreneurs who are resident in other EC Member States.
Furthermore, Germany has committed itself to providing other EC Member States with the following information through a structured automatic exchange:
a. The supply of new means of transport to entrepreneurs without using their VAT ID, b. supplies by distance or catalogue selling to other Member States which are not taxable in Germany, c. significant differences between the intra-Community acquisitions declared by a taxpayer and the VIES data submitted by other Member States, d. intra-Community supplies of goods which the German taxpayer did not report in RS, because the supplies were treated as domestic transactions, e. potential “missing trader” which made intra-Community transactions independent of the validity of their VAT ID and f. entrepreneurs who supplied goods to potential “missing traders” or recipients who misused their VAT ID.
Comparison and evaluation
Sending of RFI or spontaneous information is initiated both in the CR and Germany by competent local tax offices that send filed SCAC forms to the CLO.
While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCAC forms (CzechEnglish) and translates dispatched information into English or German language, respectively, German tax offices comply with the instruction, according to which they have to write RFI or spontaneous information exclusively in German on a single-language form.
The German CLO does not provide a translation of German texts.
When reviewing RFIs transmitted between the CR and Germany in the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005, the SAO found that the Czech tax administration settled 74,5 % of received RFIs in a given three months deadline, while RFIs sent to Germany were settled by the German tax administration in the given deadline in 40,6 % cases only.
Although the German CLO refers the tax offices to the 3-month-deadline it does not monitor the elapsed time limits.
The outcome of the missing reminders is the high quantity of delayed answers to RFIs.
Because of these problems the BRH recommended a steady reminding exercise of the CLO.
The situation has already improved.
According to our latest information the German CLO now reminds the Tos tax offices of answering the incompleted requests for information.
VAT risk management
Risk management in the CR
In the CR, several units at various organisational levels of the tax administration are concerned with VAT risk management.
Within the MoF, the following units are concerned with the aspect of risk management and combating VAT fraud:
VAT Methodology and Performance Department and, in its framework, the VAT Risk Management Unit that, i.a., manages the selection of risks of potential tax evasion and evaluates trends in these risks at a domestic and community level.
Nationally it coordinates the performance of the task of “Trustworthiness of VAT returns” and VIES data utilisation from the standpoint of tax evasion as part of intra-Community transactions.
On the basis of data on the trade balance of the CR it evaluates risky commodities, prepares VAT risk management conceptually and cooperates in this area with the relevant EC institutions and with other Member States.
The Department of International Cooperation in VAT Administration that, i.a., provides for exchange of information in the area of VAT, participates in the creation and maintenance of an information database, analyses data from other Member States contained in the VIES system, provides for informing the public and for other forms of international cooperation in the sense of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
The two SAI requested data on the number of erroneous IDs or VAT IDs contained in the O_MCTL reports transferred between the CR and Germany for the individual quarterly periods reviewed.
These data are contained in the following tables.
They show significant differences.
The reason of these differences may be a different basis for calculation of numbers of O_MCTL reports.
While the Czech CLO relates its numbers to the respective calendar quarter, for which RS were submitted, the German CLO relates its numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O_MCTL report was received.
The Methodology of Tax Control and Investigation Department that, i.a., performs risk analysis as part of methodological management of tax audits and, in accordance with risk analysis, establishes priorities for orientation of tax audits in the plans of the financial directorates, prepares risk analyses as part of reducing tax evasions including the collection of information obtained in tax administration and from other sources and proposes measures to reduce tax evasion.
Investigation departments are established at the financial directorates and, i.a., look for tax entities and high-risk areas regarding tax fraud (i.e. internet business, gold, pharmaceutical industry), look for unregistered tax entities from the standpoint of tax evasion (e.g. in the area of internet services, mediation of work, radio and printing services, etc.), analysis of connections in chain frauds and provision of information to local financial authorities.
Specialised audit departments have been established at 12 selected tax offices.
They have regional competence and perform tax audits outside the territorial competence of the tax offices on the basis of authorization.
The need to establish specialised tax audit departments followed from the increasing number of determined new and advanced types of tax evasions that occurred particularly amongst entities connected in chains.
This department concentrates on audit of tax entities according to the requirements of the investigation departments, tax entities with specific activities and international companies and tax entities with a large scope of activities as regards the magnitude of turnover.
The following mechanisms used to reduce risks in the area of VAT were integrated into the ATIS system: – the task “Trustworthiness of VAT returns” for evaluating the risk level of submitted tax returns, – the task “Choice of tax entities for inspection”, enabling selection of taxpayers for audit on the basis of selected criteria, – the task “VIES”, through which the tax administrators have access to data provided from the other EC Member States.
The task “VIES” permits, i.a.: – verifying the validity of VAT ID of taxpayers from other Member States, – obtaining from other Member States the value of goods supplied to a Czech taxpayer, declared in the RS by all its suppliers in other Member States, – generating a list of taxpayers who did not submit RS, – performance of formal control of data that taxpayers in the CR entered in RS prior to sending these data to other Member States, – generating a list of taxpayers for which data on supply of goods to other Member States entered in their VAT returns does not coincide with RS data, – generating a list of taxpayers, for which the value of goods acquired from other Member States entered in VAT returns do not coincide with the data declared in the RS of all his suppliers from other Member States.
As part of activities to reduce the risk of tax evasion, tax staff have access to the registers of the state administrative authorities, such as the commercial index, real estate register, motor vehicle register, business license register, etc.
More detailed information is provided in Chapter 4.4.1 Submission and processing of recapitulative statements in the CR.
Risk management in Germany
Because of the federal structure in Germany both the federal tax administration (in particular the CLO) and the tax administrations of the 16 federal states participate in the development and the operation of RMSs.
Although there are joint working groups for the development neither the CLO nor the tax administrations of the federal states share a completely consistent database.
At the level of the CLO unit ST I 2 (hereinafter the “KUSS“ – coordination unit for special VAT audits and tax investigations) collects audit findings on tax fraud in a separate database called OPUS.
KUSS established another database called ZAUBER in cooperation with the tax offices to communicate the names of discovered “missing traders” or VAT fraudsters.
KUSS coordinates both connected cases of national and cross-border tax fraud.
The experience gathered by KUSS is incorporated into the development of RMS in the working groups.
Furthermore, experts of several other units of the CLO and the MoF are entrusted with RMS duties and responsibilities.
At the level of the CLO, a formal control is done of the composition of VAT IDs of other Member States in submitted RS of German taxpayers.
This formal control is processed before RS data are submitted to other Member States to improve the clarity and use of the VIES data submitted (see 4.4.2).
The verification of VAT IDs mentioned in RS is proven on the basis of O_MCTL-Codes submitted by other Member States (for the process of correcting an invalid VAT ID see also 4.4.2).
Furthermore, the RMS of the CLO is based on the VIES data transmitted by other Member States and it creates several types of inspection notes based on several characteristics usually found in carousel transactions to detect a potential “missing trader”.
The tax offices of the federal states are instructed to process these inspection notes and in some cases to report the result of their investigation to the CLO.
The audit findings of the BRH confirmed that it is necessary to include all available characteristics in order to be able to assume a case of tax fraud with a sufficient probability (instead of focussing on a company’s turnover only).
So the BRH suggested to the MoF to imply a mix of diverse characteristics for producing the reports.
The RMS should include other facts like the taxpayer’s payment behaviour, the (economic) branch or the shareholders.
A second level of RMS is processed by the tax administrations of the federal states and focuses on processing of VAT returns.
RMS for example generates a list of those taxpayers who declared intra-Community supplies in their VAT returns.
This list is sent to the CLO to monitor the complete submission of RS.
Furthermore, this type of RMS compares the intra-Community acquisitions declared in the taxpayer’s annual VAT return with the data of the VIES-system.
The tax administrations of the federal states avoid a comparison of the quarterly data because this comparison would disclose too many mismatches which may attributed to other reasons than tax evasion or tax fraud; for example:
– differing times when the supplier and the acquirer thought the intra-Community transaction was carried out;
– differing accounting and declaring of sales discounts and incentives.
In addition to comparing the VAT return data and VIES data many federal states implemented components of RMS based on the data of VAT returns, and some other facts (like the composition of the firm‘s name, the age of the shareholders, the number of employees and the taxpayer’s payment behaviour).
Bavaria implemented a rule-based RMS, permitting a team of tax fraud specialists (hereinafter the risk managers) to program their own rules to identify potential tax fraudsters.
This RMS is applied when the tax offices are processing the monthly VAT return.
So the tax office in charge receives suspected cases of the RMS before the VAT is fixed.
Since this RMS is not able to learn the risk managers have to adjust the rules on the basis of the feedback of the tax offices.
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has programmed an adaptive neural network with the data of tax files in which an audit disclosed tax evasions.
Based on these data the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.
The RMS produces a list of tax files monthly, which are suspected of being involved in tax evasion.
On the basis of this list the tax offices in charge decide to audit the proposed taxpayers.
After the audit the auditors have to report their findings, so the RMS can learn from the results of its list.
North-Rhine Westphalia uses an adaptive neural network which is combined with a rule-based fuzzy-system.
Based on many data of assessed VAT returns and some other facts this neuro-fuzzy- or data mining system calculates the probability that a taxpayer is involved in tax fraud.
Afterwards it produces a monthly list of potential tax fraudsters.
Based on this list the local tax offices choose relevant taxpayers for an audit and report the audit findings to the data processing centre.
The implementation of any of these three RMS in other federal states is in progress.
Since none of these three RMS is based on the same approach a combination of all the systems seems to be useful for tackling tax fraud.
It will remain to be seen if such a system achieves the expected results.
Comparison and evaluation
Although specific criteria of the RMS of CR and Germany could not be discussed in this report, the SAO and the BRH found that each Member State developed its own RMS.
Like the different approaches of the three federal states in Germany the RMS of each European state has its own strengths and weaknesses.
The tax authorities of the European Member States currently discuss new tendencies and new models of crossborder VAT fraud.
VAT fraud – especially carousel fraud – did not turn out to be a national but a European problem rather.
Taxpayers involved in fraudulent activities act simultaneously not only in one Member State but in several states.
An effective RMS cannot be developed by one Member State only.
Successful criteria, components or approaches of a RMS have to be exchanged and implemented in each Member State of the EC, if not so fraudsters will choose that Member State with the weakest RMS.
VAT loss caused by the Europe-wide fraud need not to affect the Member State of the initiator of the fraud.
Each Member State that is involved in the fraudulent activities can be affected.
So there should be a European exchange and discussion of RMS.
Selected audit findings on verification of commercial transactions
As part of the parallel audits the SAO and BRH reviewed the quality and use of information on selected business transactions that were subject to international exchange of information between the tax administrations of the CR and Germany.
In addition, the two audit institutions jointly reviewed several business transactions where there were doubts about their execution or discrepancies in the manner in which taxpayers in the two countries reported such business transactions in their VAT returns or RS.
At the request of the BRH, the SAO reviewed a total of 8 cases related to business transactions performed between 8 Czech and 8 German tax entities.
In addition, in 43 cases, on the basis of notification by the BRH, the SAO reviewed the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany, reported by Czech taxpayers in their tax returns and RS.
Upon request from the SAO, the BRH reviewed a total of 23 cases related to business transactions performed between 23 German and 21 Czech tax entities.
Relevant information was exclusively exchanged on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 using official communication by the CLO.
The review of those selected cases revealed, i.a. that, the different ways of registration in the EC Member States cause problems as mentioned in chapter 4.1:
1.
According to the data from VIES, in the 3rd quarter of 2004, a Czech taxpayer acquired goods from a German taxpayer at a value of EUR 60,500.
When the Czech taxpayer declared acquisition of goods at a value corresponding to only EUR 29,869 the Czech tax administration sent a request to Germany for verification of the value of the supplied goods.
The German party stated in the answer to the RFI delivered from Germany that, in the 2nd quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer supplied goods to the Czech taxpayer at a value of EUR 27,381, in the 3rd quarter at a value of EUR 31,997 and, in the 4th quarter, at a value of EUR 10,276.
It further followed from the answer that the VAT ID of the German taxpayer was valid only from 28 September 2004 but, on the basis of an additional request by the German taxpayer for certification of the validity of VAT ID, in 2006 the German CLO retroactively issued a certificate with validity of the VAT ID from 1 May 2004.
The German taxpayer corrected the RS.
On the basis of this information, this was a case of acquisition of goods by the Czech taxpayer.
Through an inquiry at the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that, on the basis of an investigation by the tax administrator, the Czech taxpayer submitted additional VAT returns for the individual taxable periods in 2004, in which he increased the value of the goods acquired from other Member States and simultaneously made claims for deduction of VAT on acquisition of goods from other Member States.
However, the Czech tax administrator could not unambiguously determine from these additional VAT returns whether they also include the value of supplies from the above-mentioned German supplier.
On the basis of a request from the SAO, the BRH found that the German supplier was registered for VAT in September 2003.
However, because he did not request the allocation of a VAT ID on registration, he was allocated only an identification number for transactions in Germany.
Although it is not usually possible to allocate a taxpayer a VAT ID retroactively in Germany, in this case, in 2006 the German tax official assigned to this German taxpayer a VAT ID retroactively as of 1 May 2004.
The German CLO allocates a VAT ID retroactively if the German entrepreneur did not cause the delay of the allocation; for example if the CLO caused the delay after the taxpayer’s application of a VAT ID.
In this case the CLO allocates VAT ID retroactively because the entrepreneur does not provide an own valid VAT ID for an intra-Community supply according to § 6 UStG.
Vice versa a German recipient does not provide a valid VAT ID of his supplier to declare an intra-Community acquisition.
Because of these different processes between the Member States the German CLO allocated VAT ID retroactively in this special case.
2.
As part of international exchange of information, the Czech tax administrator requested review of the VAT registration of the German taxpayer.
VIES gives a registration date of 5 March 2005, while the date 1 October 2004 is given in the certificate of registration of the German taxpayer issued by the competent local German tax office.
The German authorities stated in the answer sent from Germany that the German tax entity was registered on 1 October 2004, but that, for organisational reasons, he was allocated a VAT ID in Germany only on 16 February 2005.
Through a question sent to the competent local tax administrator, the SAO found that the Czech tax administrator performed a VAT audit at the Czech taxpayer for the taxation periods of the 3rd quarter of 2004 to the 2nd quarter of 2005.
In this audit, the tax office found that the Czech taxpayer included in his VAT return services at a value of CZK 9,897 (EUR 314), provided to the German taxpayer prior to his VAT registration (i.e. prior to 1 October 2004).
The tax office subsequently assessed VAT of CZK 1,880 (EUR 60) for the tax entity for the taxation period of the 3rd quarter of 2004.
On the basis of a request from the SAO, the BRH found that the VAT ID was allocated to the German taxpayer only on 16 February 2005, when he informed the tax office about his business which was started in 2004.
Furthermore the tax office registered him retroactively for VAT as 1 October 200415 to monitor the submission of the annual VAT return of the year 2004.
In this VAT return the taxpayer declared intra-Community acquisitions from CR in the amount of EUR 160 (» CZK 5,000).
3. In the VAT return for September 2004 and RS for the 3rd quarter of 2004, the Czech taxpayer declared the supply of goods at a value of CZK 114,615 (EUR 3,642) to a German taxpayer.
In reviewing the registration of the German taxpayer in the VIES system, the Czech tax administrator found that his registration was valid from 11 November 2004, i.e. after supply of the goods to Germany by the Czech taxpayer.
The Czech taxpayer submitted an additional VAT return, in which he declared a tax base for performed domestic supplies at a value of CZK 114,615 (EUR 3,642) and VAT of CZK 21,777 (EUR 692), which he paid.
Through a question to the competent local tax office in the CR, the SAO found that the Czech taxpayer subsequently submitted a request for renewal of the proceedings in the matter of the additional VAT return and, as evidence, submitted the statement of the German tax administration that the German taxpayer had been registered for taxes since 1 January 2000.
Consequently, the Czech tax administrator reviewed the validity of registration of the German taxpayer as part of international exchange of information.
It followed from the answer delivered from Germany that the German taxpayer was allocated a VAT ID only on 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of supply of the goods.
Consequently, the tax administrator in the CR rejected the request for renewal of the proceedings.
The BRH found that, in this case, intra-Community acquisition of goods was not involved because the German taxpayer obtained a VAT ID only on 11 November 2004.
However, the German recipient declared the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and he declared VAT on this intra-Community acquisition, as he demanded the refund of the input VAT in the same amount.
Since there would be no change in VAT value that the German taxpayer would be obliged to pay, the tax administrator in Germany did not correct the data in his VAT return.
The BRH further found that the name of the German taxpayer mentioned in the RFI was changed during the processing of the answer in Germany, as a consequence of which there was confusion between two German tax entities.
This change of the name of the German taxpayer also confused the Czech tax administrator.
4.
As part of international exchange of information, the German tax administrator reviewed the acquisition of goods by a Czech taxpayer in the 1st quarter of 2005, at a value of EUR 22,686 from a German taxpayer.
Through an inquiry to the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that this administrator performed a local investigation concerning the Czech taxpayer in which he reviewed whether the supply of the goods was performed and whether the Czech taxpayer entered the invoice for these goods in the accounts and paid it.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare the acquisition of the goods in his VAT return, because the German supplier did not state his VAT ID in the tax document, but only the tax number intended for domestic transactions in Germany.
In the VIES application, the Czech tax administrator found that the German taxpayer was registered for VAT for intra-Community transactions only from 21 April 2005, i.e. after performance of the supply to the Czech taxpayer.
The Czech tax administrator also requested that the German tax administration send a copy of the certificate of registration of the German taxpayer so that, if required, he could take steps to assess taxes.
The Czech tax office assessed this business transaction as acquisition of goods from a nontaxpayer in Germany and thus did not subsequently assess taxes for the Czech taxpayer from this business transaction.
The BRH found that, according to the German legislation, for a taxpayer supplying goods to other Member States there is no need for a VAT ID ensuring that intra-Community supplies of goods are exempt from VAT.
The supplier must only have the VAT ID of the acquirer in the other Member State and must be capable of demonstrating transport of the given goods to the other Member State.
Thus, according to the German VAT law, this was an intra-Community transaction and VAT should be assessed in the CR.
Anyway it is important that the Czech tax administrator took note of this transaction because the supply of a machine of that value was not the German supplier’s core business.
As described in chapter 4.6.2 the German CLO declines to answer RFIs which are applied to intra-Community transactions if the amount is less than the minimum threshold of EUR 15,000:
5. According to VIES data in the 3rd quarter of 2004, the Czech taxpayer acquired goods from the German taxpayer at a value of EUR 12,561.
The Czech tax administrator performed a tax audit of the tax entity for this taxable period.
As part of international cooperation, the Czech tax administration requested review of supply of these goods via a SCAC form.
The Czech taxpayer stated that he did not receive the goods, that he had never done business with the German company and that the acquisition of these goods was not entered in his accounts.
The German tax administration rejected the request for provision of evidence – contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents, stating that the turnover did not exceed the amount of EUR 15,000 and no other explanations were given.
As the Czech tax administrator did not obtain any evidence for retrospective tax assessment on the goods acquired, the tax audit ended without any findings and the tax liability remained assessed in the original amount.
On the basis of a request from the SAO, the BRH found that the German taxpayer acted as a “fiscal representative” (§ 22 (a) – (e) UStG).
The German taxpayer reported these supplies in its annual VAT return and in the RS.
His right to exemption of the supplies was recognised.
On the basis of notification by the BRH, the German tax office will send documents to the CR, required for subsequent assessment of taxes on the acquired goods.
It was shown in chapter 4.6.1 that replies to RFIs sent by the German tax administration exceeded the 3-monthtime limit more often than replies of the Czech tax administration:
6. SAO found in the audit that, on 5 October 2005 the Czech tax administration sent a request for information to Germany, related to reviewing the value of goods supplied in the 4th quarter of 2004.
In the RS for this period, the German taxpayer declared supply of goods to the Czech taxpayer in the value of EUR 86,307; however, for the same period, the Czech taxpayer declared in the VAT return only the acquisition of goods for a value corresponding to EUR 35,314.
In the answer to the RFI delivered to the CR on 9 May 2006, i.e. following expiry of the deadline for processing, stipulated in Art. 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German party stated that the request could not be processed, as the operation of the German company was terminated at the end of 2005.
Since the German tax administration did not comply with the deadline for processing the RFI, the Czech tax administration did not have the documents necessary for the tax proceedings in the CR.
7. In 2005, the Czech tax administrator requested - via a SCAC form - review of a supply of automobiles to a German taxpayer at a value of EUR 1,265,554, performed in the 3rd and 4th quarter of 2004 since the transaction showed characteristics of carousel fraud.
The SAO found that an answer to the RFI had not been received from Germany at the time of the audit.
Through an inquiry to the competent local tax administrator, the SAO found that the Czech taxpayer did not include in his VAT return the supplies of new means of transportation for this German taxpayer at a value of CZK 11,816,103 (EUR 37 5,472).
The Czech tax administrator corrected the tax return information and the Czech tax entity submitted a corrected RS.
On the basis of the request by the SAO, the BRH found that, for technical reasons, the German CLO did not transfer this RFI to the competent local tax office for review.
Following notification by the BRH, an audit was performed at the German acquirer in Germany, which provided evidence that the acquisition of all the automobiles was properly taxed and that the relevant automobiles were sold to other taxpayers in Germany.
8. According to VIES data in the 4th quarter of 2004 the Czech taxpayer acquired a passenger car from the German taxpayer, at a value of EUR 48,500.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare acquisition of these goods.
In an inquiry to the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that the Czech taxpayer has not submitted a VAT return since August 2004.
The Czech taxpayer did not submit tax returns even after being invited to do so by the tax administrator; consequently, on 23 May 2005, the tax office assessed VAT for the period from October to December 2004 in the amount of CZK 0.
On 2 June 2005, the CLO referred to this supply from a German taxpayer.
Since the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the tax administrator, the administrator sent a RFI to Germany in relation to the above-mentioned supply.
As the answer to the RFI was delivered only on 7 February 2007, it was not known by the time of completion of the SAO’s audit in which way the Czech tax administrator used the information obtained by international exchange.
Because of failure to comply with obligations following from the Act on VAT, registration for VAT was cancelled for the Czech taxpayer as of 23 August 2005.
In some cases only a partial reply was sent because the audit carried out by tax offices at taxpayers was not finished at the time of the audit of the SAO and BRH:
9.
In 2005, through a SCAC form, the Czech tax administrator requested review of supply of automobiles to a German taxpayer at a value of EUR 16,991 performed in the 3rd quarter of 2004, showing the characteristics of carousel fraud.
In his answer to the RFI, the German tax administrator stated that he had available only the invoices issued by the Czech taxpayer for supplies at a value of EUR 16,335.
On the basis of the request from the SAO, the BRH found that the audit performed by the German tax office at the acquirer in Germany had not yet been completed.
The German acquirer declared the acquisition of goods at a value of EUR 16,335 twice, in the tax returns for the months of August and September 2004.
10.
In 2005, through a SCAC form, the Czech tax administrator requested review of supplies of automobiles to a German taxpayer at a value of EUR 198,167, performed in the 4th quarter of 2004 and 1st quarter of 2005, showing the characteristics of carousel fraud.
The German tax administration sent a partial answer to the RFI to the CR, in which it confirmed that the German taxpayer acquired several automobiles and further stated that the investigation in Germany had not yet been completed.
The SAO found that the competent local tax office performed several local investigations at the Czech supplier for the purpose of reviewing the claim of excessive VAT deductions, in which it did not find unauthorised claiming.
The BRH found that in this period the German taxpayer declared in his VAT returns the acquisition of goods from other Member States with a total value of EUR 579,114 and that the audit performed by the German tax office at the acquirer in Germany has still not yet been completed.
In chapter 4.4.1 the reasons of mismatches between the declaration of intra-Community acquisitions in the recipient’s VAT return and the data of the RS of the supplier are described.
The audited cases showed that temporary mismatches or the improper declaration of a transaction as an intra-Community supply of goods in RS were not the most frequent causes for the deviations:
11.
According to data from the VIES system, in the 1st quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer allegedly acquired goods at a value of EUR 35,716 from the German taxpayer; however, the Czech taxpayer did not declare this acquisition.
Since the Czech taxpayer failed to cooperate with the tax administrator and no activities were performed in the registered seat of the company, the Czech tax administrator requested, as part of international exchange of information, review of the way in which the German taxpayer communicated with the Czech taxpayer.
The answer to the RFI delivered from Germany showed that, according to the findings of the German tax administration, the Czech tax entity was unknown at the address communicated and an agreed transporter accepted the goods.
The order was for the total sum of EUR 155,000 but the German taxpayer supplied only goods at a value of EUR 21,659.
The Czech taxpayer sent the German taxpayer false confirmation of payment of the sum of EUR 155,153 in favour of the German taxpayer.
Following identification of the fraudulent conduct on the part of the Czech acquirer, the German taxpayer managed to reobtain the supplied material, with the assistance of his other Czech customers, with the exception of one item at a value of EUR 7,916.
Through an inquiry at the competent local tax office in the CR, the SAO found that the tax administration, i.a., on the basis of the obtained information, subsequently assessed the Czech taxpayer VAT for the goods acquired from other Member States in the amount of CZK 388,522 (EUR 13,044).
On the basis of an inquiry from the SAO, the BRH confirmed that, following corrections, the German supplier declared supply of goods to the Czech taxpayer at a value of only EUR 7,916.
According to the German legal situation the German taxpayer declared the reclaim of the goods and the reduction of the taxable amount in the quarter of the reclaim.
So his RS contained the following declarations concerning the Czech taxpayer:
12.
As part of international exchange of information, the German tax administration requested, through a SCAC form, review of supply of goods and provision of services, performed in the 3rd quarter of 2005.
According to this RFI in this period, the Czech taxpayer had supplied goods to the German taxpayer at a total value of EUR 396,126 and had provided services at a value of EUR 11,885.
The SAO found that the Czech tax administration performed a local investigation concerning the Czech taxpayer for the purpose of reviewing this supply.
In response to the RFI, the Czech tax administration stated that the Czech taxpayer supplied the German taxpayer with a production line, including assembly.
The Czech taxpayer supplied the individual parts of the production line prior to accession of the CR to the EC and the line was assembled after May 1, 2004 on the basis of an order.
The German taxpayer did not accept the assembled line because of asserted defects.
In the 3rd quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer issued an invoice to the German taxpayer for the sum of EUR 107,100 for assembly and EUR 11,885 for services.
The German taxpayer accepted the invoices, but did not recognise them and did not pay them.
Through an inquiry at the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that all the invoices were properly entered in the accounts of the Czech taxpayer.
VAT returns for the 3rd quarter of 2005 contain only those amounts that were documented by the Czech taxpayer and that were related to invoicing after May 1, 2004.
The BRH found that, on the basis of the answer from the Czech tax administration, the competent local tax office arrived at the conclusion that those transactions were a consistent supply of goods from the Czech taxpayer to the German taxpayer including the service of the assembly.
In this special case, the place of this so-called work supply is where the production line is assembled.
The German recipient of the work supply is obliged to pay the VAT according to the German VAT law.
Simultaneously, the recipient may apply for deduction of VAT in the same amount.
As there would be no changes in the VAT value that the German taxpayer would be obliged to pay, corrections in the tax return were neglected by the German tax office.
13. According to VIES data, in February 2005 Czech taxpayer A purchased a machine from German taxpayer C at a value of EUR 58,000.
The Czech tax administrator sent a request to Germany for review of this information.
In answer to the RFI, the German party stated that German taxpayer C supplied that machine to Czech taxpayer B in 2004, but that he returned the machine to German taxpayer C in October 2004.
According to the information of the German tax administration, the machine was not transferred back to Germany, but was transported to the organisational unit of German taxpayer C in the CR.
It further followed from the answer to the RFI that, in February 2005, German taxpayer C sold the machine to Czech taxpayer A.
This taxpayer received the machine in the seat of the organisational unit of the German taxpayer in the CR.
As the supply was performed only within the CR, this did not constitute an intra-Community supply of goods.
By means of a question to the tax administrator in charge of taxpayer B, the SAO found that according to VIES data, German taxpayer C supplied goods to Czech taxpayer B in the 3rd quarter of 2004 (another machine), at a value of EUR 88,027.
Taxpayer B stated that he did not receive these goods and these the competent local tax administrator in the CR sent a RFI to Germany.
According to the answer to this request, the machine was supplied.
In a further investigation at taxpayer B, the Czech tax administrator found that the machine at a value of EUR 88,027 was not entered in the accounts of taxpayer B and that this could be a machine of the same kind as was supplied by the organisational unit of German taxpayer C to Czech taxpayer A in February 2005.
The SAO further found that the Czech tax administrator competent local for taxpayer A performed a local investigation concerning this taxpayer.
The tax administrator had the invoice of German taxpayer C of 7 February 2005, in which taxpayer A is stated as the customer for the machine.
The Czech tax administrator found that taxpayer A had not entered this invoice in his accounts.
Taxpayer A had concluded a leasing agreement with another Czech company, where the subject of the leasing was a machine of the same kind.
The leasing company supplied the machine on 9 February 2005 and the leasing company provided for the transport of the machine.
The Czech tax office failed to use the information contained in the answer to the request for information for assessing the tax obligation of taxpayer A.
The BRH found that German taxpayer C did not supply the machine at a value of EUR 88,027 to the CR, but to another German taxpayer D.
Thus, this did not constitute intra-Community supply of goods, but taxable supply in Germany.
Consequently, the German tax administrator did not recognise the claim of German taxpayer C to exemption from VAT and corrected the data in his tax return.
The German taxpayer D supplied the machine to the Czech taxpayer B.
According to the German legislation, this supply was not taxable in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the CR.
BRH further found that, in his RS for the 1st quarter of 2005, German taxpayer C entered the supply of a machine at a value of EUR 58,000 to Czech taxpayer A.
This supply was not reviewed during the tax audit performed by the German tax office.
The following figure shows the contractual relationships between participants of the above mentioned business transactions.
14.
Auditing received RFIs, SAO found that on 4 October 2005 the Czech tax administration received an RFI from Germany, in which a German tax administrator requested confirmation of intra-Community supply from a German taxpayer at a value of EUR 879,680,625 to a Czech taxpayer.
According to the German tax administrator, there was a suspicion that that was a case of fictitious intra-Community supply of goods.
It was further stated in the RFI that the German taxpayer had not done any active business since 1999.
SAO stated that the Czech tax administrator performed a local investigation concerning the Czech taxpayer.
The executive of the Czech company stated that the above-mentioned case was probably a claim of the German taxpayer in relation to the German tax administration that was set up by the Czech taxpayer as a shareholder in the German company at the German tax office.
According to information provided to the SAO, to the present time the Czech tax administrator has not had any information that the German tax administration is processing the matter in relation to the Czech taxpayer.
The available information indicates that this was not a case of supply of goods; nonetheless, this value is still included in the VIES system as intra-Community supply of goods to a Czech taxpayer from Germany.
The most important reason for those discrepancies was that the recipients did not declare the intra-Community acquisitions in their tax returns (see also chapter 4.4.1):
15. According to the VIES data, a German taxpayer supplied goods to a Czech taxpayer in a total value of EUR 33,205 in the period from the 3rd quarter of 2004 to the 1st quarter of 2005.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare this acquisition.
The Czech tax administrator requested review of the supply of the goods from Germany as part of international exchange of information.
In its answer to this request, the German party stated that the German taxpayer sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech taxpayer and that the Czech taxpayer picked up the remaining goods in person.
In an inquiry to the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that, prior to obtaining an answer to the RFI, the Czech taxpayer submitted an additional VAT return for this period.
In spite of this submission, the differences in the acquisition values were not resolved and thus the Czech tax administrator recommended that a tax audit be performed at the Czech taxpayer.
The audit has not been carried out yet.
16. According to the data from VIES, in the 3rd quarter of 2004 a German taxpayer supplied to a Czech taxpayer goods at a value of EUR 46,854.
For the same period, the Czech taxpayer declared intra-Community acquisition of goods only in an amount corresponding to the sum of EUR 14,856.
As part of international exchange of information, the Czech tax administrator asked for a review of the amount of the actual supply.
In the response to this request delivered from Germany, 3 invoices were provided, with a total stated value of supplied goods of EUR 31,999, i.e. a value corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech taxpayer and the data in the VIES system.
In an inquiry to the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that, following receipt of the answer from Germany, the Czech tax administrator contacted the accountant of the Czech taxpayer and they agreed that, after reviewing these invoices with the owner of the company, she would discuss the submission of an additional VAT return for the 3rd quarter of 2004.
By now, the additional tax return was not submitted.
The Czech tax administrator informed the SAO that he would proceed so as to comply with the set deadlines for any retroactive assessment of VAT for the relevant taxation period.
17.
In the 4th quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer supplied goods to the Czech taxpayer at a value of EUR 11,600.
As part of international exchange of information, the German tax administrator requested confirmation of whether the Czech taxpayer actually existed, because the alleged shareholder of the German taxpayer established a number of fictitious companies in Germany.
During reviewing of the business transaction by the tax office, the Czech taxpayer confirmed the acquisition of the goods.
However, according to a statement by the Czech taxpayer, the goods were not transported from Germany to the CR and were further sold in Germany during 2005.
The Czech taxpayer submitted documents on sale of the goods in January 2005.
The Czech taxpayer was not registered in Germany as a VAT payer and did not declare or pay taxes for the sale of the relevant goods neither in the CR nor Germany.
All these facts indicated tax evasion in the territory of Germany and the Czech tax administrator communicated these facts to the German tax administration in the answer to the RFI.
In an inquiry to the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that, on the basis of a performed investigation, the Czech taxpayer submitted an additional VAT return for the 4th quarter of 2004, in which he included the value of goods acquired, i.a. from a German taxpayer and simultaneously exercised the right to tax deduction in acquisition of goods from other Member States.
He did not enter VAT on sale of goods in Germany to the Czech VAT return.
The Czech tax administrator assessed an additional VAT return following the local investigation without any changes.
According to the Czech legislation, the case in question did not consist in acquisition of goods from other Member States, as the goods were not sent or transported from another Member State to the CR.
Thus, the Czech tax administrator drew an erroneous conclusion in the local investigation.
The BRH found that, immediately after receiving the answer to the RFI, stating that the goods did not leave Germany, the German tax administrator corrected the tax return of the German taxpayer and requested payment of VAT of EUR 1,600.
Furthermore, the competent tax office sent a hint to the tax office of the real recipient of the goods to ensure that the further sale of these goods is properly taxed.
In the following cases taxpayers declared intra-Community transactions, which were probably not realised in fact:
18.
The Czech tax administrator obtained a request from the German tax administration for information on whether the Czech taxpayer acquired a passenger car at a value of EUR 47,400 from the German taxpayer in February 2005.
The request included an annex consisting in a copy of the VAT registration certificate of the Czech taxpayer.
It also included a copy of the passport of the person who was said to have performed the transport of this automobile.
The Czech tax administrator found in the investigation that this was a stolen passport, that the person mentioned in it did not import any vehicle into the CR and he stated that he did not have any contacts with a German tax entity.
The Czech tax administrator never issued the certificate of VAT registration, whose copy was sent by the German party.
The Czech tax administrator entered these data in the answer to the RFI together with the fact that he cannot confirm the acquisition of the goods – the automobile in question.
Through a question to the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that the Czech taxpayer does not have his seat at the address listed in the Commercial Register and the executive of the company could not be contacted.
After performance of a tax objection proceeding for the taxation period of February 2005, the Czech tax administrator assessed the Czech taxpayer tax obligation in the amount of CZK 0.
In a further investigation, the Czech tax administrator found that the relevant automobile was sold to a further Czech entity, who purchased it through an Internet advertisement.
BRH found that, on the basis of the Czech answer to the RFI, the competent local German tax administrator did not recognise the claim of the German taxpayer to VAT exemption for this supply.
19. During an audit a German tax office was not able to clarify a difference of EUR 3,000 between the amount of acquired goods declared in the taxpayer’s tax return and the amount submitted from other Member States.
A Czech taxpayer was said to have supplied goods at a value of EUR 89,424 to a German taxpayer during the 4th quarter of 2004 and 1st quarter of 2005.
As the acquisition declared by the German taxpayer did not correspond to the data in VIES, the German tax administrator requested review of supplies and their payment as part of international exchange of information.
In the answer to the RFI, the Czech tax administrator stated that the single executive for the Czech company had been erased from the Commercial Register on 8 July 2005 and a new executive had not been entered.
The German recipient of the goods was presumably a relative to the shareholder in the Czech company.
The Czech taxpayer submitted a VAT return and a RS that, following deletion of the executive from the Commercial Register, was signed by an unauthorised person – this shareholder in the company.
The accountant of the Czech taxpayer told the tax administrator that the shareholder in the company deposited the cash paid for the invoiced goods in EUR to the account of the company.
Cash documents were not drawn up.
Through an inquiry to the competent local tax office, the SAO in the CR found that the tax administrator recognised that the Czech taxpayer had the right to exemption from VAT for supply of goods to other Member States in the value of CZK 1,326,307 (EUR 42,145) for the 1st quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 (EUR 47,548) for the 1st quarter of 2005.
The BRH found that the tax administrator in Germany did not correct the VAT return of the German acquirer because a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German taxpayer in the meantime.
Since the earlier audit did not detect any signs for tax fraud there would not be any chance to recover an assessed VAT liability.
20. According to VIES data in the year 2005 a German taxpayer acquired goods from CR in the amount of EUR 4,251,196 after he had acquired goods in the amount of EUR 43,274 in the previous year.
Neither in his VAT return of 2004 nor in his VAT return of 2005 did the German taxpayer declare intraCommunity acquisitions.
Furthermore, he did not declare any proportionate supplies.
Because of these differences the German tax office started an RFI concerning the 4th quarter of 2005 and the 1st quarter of 2006.
In the RS for these two quarters a Czech supplier declared intra-Community supplies of goods in a total value of CZK 167,246,083 (EUR 5,615,299).
On 6 September 2006, the RFI was delivered, in which the German party requested review of whether the intra-Community supply declared by the Czech taxpayer had actually occurred.
In the answer to this RFI, the Czech tax administration stated that it was not possible to comply with the German request because the Czech taxpayer did not have an executive.
As can be seen from the documents provided to SAO by the relevant tax administrator, a protocol was drawn up with the executive of the Czech taxpayer on 30 March 2006 on commencement of VAT audit for the 4th quarter of 2004 and for January to December 2005.
The taxpayer was simultaneously invited by the tax administrator to submit all the accounting and tax documents for that period, but he did not submit any documents.
According to the Commercial Register, the functional term of the sole executive ended as of 16 May 2005 but a new executive was not appointed.
The Czech taxpayer ceased submitting VAT returns in April 2006.
As part of this audit, the SAO reviewed jointly with the BRH several cases of intra-Community supplies performed between the CR and Germany that were not subject to previous exchange of information between the tax administrations of the two countries.
The two supreme audit institutions shared information on the reviewed cases via CLO of both countries.
21. A Czech company (eCR) which is not resident in Germany informed the competent tax office (Chemnitz-Süd) that it was going to accomplish taxable transactions in Germany.
Because of this information the company has been registered since June 2005 but it did not get a German VAT ID.
The (eCR) accepted an order of a Danish entrepreneur (eDK) to manufacture several wind power stations and to deliver those wind power stations on behalf, at risk and for account of the Danish customer to Austria.
For lack of sufficient capacities of its own the Czech company passed a part of the order to a German taxpayer (eD) who is resident in Germany.
The following figure shows the contractual relationships and the way of transport of the wind power stations:
According to the German legal situation the place of these transactions has to be determined as described in the following:
– The Danish entrepreneur (eDK) sent the wind power stations for assembly in his name, at his risk and for his own account to Austria.
Because of the assembly his supply takes place in Austria – the supply of the wind power stations is taxable in Austria.
– Since the forwarding agent was instructed by the Danish entrepreneur (eDK) and the transport was on his behalf, on his risk and for his own account, the supply of the German subcontractor (eD) takes place where the transport started – in Germany.
Although the wind power stations have been sent to another EC Member State (A) and the recipient is a registered taxpayer of an EC Member State (CR) the supply of the German subcontractor (eD) could not gain any tax exemption because the EC Member State of destination differs from the EC Member State of the residence of the Czech company.
So this supply is properly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (eCR) deducted the input VAT in its tax returns.
The place of the supply of the Czech company (eCR) is also determined by where the transport started.
However the transport of some wind power stations started in the CR and of some others in Germany.
– The supply of those wind power stations, which are manufactured in the CR, takes place in the CR.
– The supply of the other wind power stations, which are manufactured in Germany, takes place in Germany.
So the Czech company (eCR) delivered both intra-Community supplies from the CR to Austria and intra-Community supplies from Germany to Austria.
The BRH found that neither the Czech company (eCR) declared any intra-Community acquisitions in its German tax return nor submitted a RS to the German CLO.
So it may be possible that the Czech company declared all the intra-Community supplies uniformly as intra-Community supplies from the CR.
The SAO found that the eCR did not declare any intra-Community supplies to Austria but intra-Community supplies to Denmark.
To provide evidence for the taxation of the intra-Community acquisitions in Austria the cooperation of at least four tax administrations (the Austrian, the Czech, the Danish and the German) would be required although that case does not show any sign of tax fraud or of tax evasion.
Furthermore, the SAO and the BRH reviewed transactions to show the size of the differences between the declarations in the VAT return and the VIES data caused by the different legal provisions of VAT in 2004.
The reviewed cases demonstrate also that a change in these legal provisions takes time until the taxpayers and the tax offices apply the new legislation:
22. In the RS for the 2nd to 4th quarter of 2004, a Czech taxpayer declared supply of goods to a German taxpayer in a total value of CZK 792,977,452 (EUR 25,197,885).
In the same period, another Czech taxpayer declared in its RS intra-Community supplies to another German taxpayer in a total amount of CZK 18,157,265 (EUR 576,970).
Information provided to the SAO by the BRH indicated that both cases involved the supply of electrical energy.
Both Czech taxpayers stated the above-mentioned supplies in their RS in accordance with Act No. 235/2004 Coll., valid in 2004.
In a further review of these transactions, an audit group from the SAO found that there were differences in legislation on supply or acquisition of electrical energy between the CR and Germany in 2004.
While, in the CR, taxpayers declared the supply of electrical energy in accordance with the applicable statutory text of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. as intra-Community supply of goods, on the basis of German legislation applicable in 2004, this did not correspond to intra-Community acquisition of goods, but rather to taxable transaction with place of transaction in the territory of Germany.
Differences in the legislation were eliminated in the CR by adoption of Act No. 635/2004 Coll. amending some laws to comply with the administrative fees act effective as from 1 January 2005.
23. A review of selected intra-Community transactions in cooperation with the BRH, showed that a Czech taxpayer declared intra-Community supplies to a German taxpayer in a total value of CZK 240,411,163 (EUR 8,071,823) in his RS for the 1st and 4th quarters of 2005, and that another Czech taxpayer declared, in the RS for the same period, intra-Community supplies to another German taxpayer in a total value of CZK 263,470,776 (EUR 8,846,050).
Information provided to the SAO by the BRH indicated that both cases involved the supply of electrical energy.
Pursuant to statutory text of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., effective as from 1 January 2005, in the case of supply of electrical energy, the place of transaction is the place where the acquirer has his registered office, the place of business or where he has his commercial premises for which these goods are supplied.
Therefore, the Czech taxpayers should not have entered the supplies of electrical energy in their RS in 2005.
The fact that both taxpayers declared intra-Community supply of electricity in their RS led to distortion of data in VIES by a total of CZK 503,881,939 (EUR 16,917,873).
Conclusion
The cooperation achieved the objectives of BRH and SAO.
Both SAI obtained a deeper knowledge of the systems of administration of VAT in the CR and Germany.
The cooperation revealed differences of the two systems and disclosed that the legal provisions governing VAT administration vary.
During the parallel audits, suspicious cases of intra-Community transactions were detected.
Some of them merit further review.
On the basis of audit findings, both SAI produced recommendations on VAT administration.
To monitor implementation of these recommendations and to review the above mentioned cases a follow-up audit should be conducted..
The new experience and knowledge gained by cooperation of both audit institutions are the basis for successful accomplishment of future audit missions of VAT administration.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a knife attack, has been released from the hospital.
According to a report in the daily newspaper "O Globo", the far-right ex-military wanted to fly to his hometown Río de Janeiro.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will attend any events in the last week before the presidential elections.
The politician had been attacked on the street in early September during an election campaign in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, in several Brazilian cities, thousands of people took to the streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (English: "Not him"), especially women's associations protested against the ex-military.
The associations also took to social media to protest against Bolsonaro's racist and misogynist statements.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic hub São Paulo.
In the capital of Brasilia, protests mixed with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers’ Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He took the position of former president Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years in prison due to corruption and therefore cannot stand for the presidency.
The presidential election in Brazil will be on October 7.
As the former mayor of the megacity of São Paulo, Haddad has so far been behind the extreme right candidate Bolsonaro according to polls.
The “Trump of Brazil” has been in politics for a long time, but only recently has presented himself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach absolute majority in the first round, there will be a runoff election on October 28th.
Experts assume that Bolsonaro will not be victorious - no matter who he is up against.
Bolsonaro is known for being against gay and black people and for glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He shocks the people of Brazil with verbal derailments over and over again.
Once he said that the supporters of Lula's left-wing Labor Party should be shot dead.

Following a long illness: Danish rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 following a long illness, shared his producer Jörn Jeppesen on Larsen’s website.
Larsen was surrounded on his deathbed by his wife and six children.
Since the beginning of the year the musician had been under treatment for prostate cancer.
Larsen became famous with the band Gasolin', which in the 1970s was enormously successful in Scandinavia.
Their songs were influenced by music greats such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
In 1978, after the dissolution of the band, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His album "Midt om natten" from 1983 is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
The Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen paid tribute to Larsen on Sunday as a "street boy" who was "against everything, but in everyone’s hearts."
The head of government also recalled that in the year 2010 the monarchy opponent Larsen performed on the occasion of the 70th birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.

A night of rock in the shoe factory: Loud as a jackhammer
Here we stand, taking the bone saw and igniting a concert evening with the strength of a tiger. The band names Here We Stand, Tiger Bonesaw and The Ignition alone suggest such a description of the rocking live music event on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik, the community center housed in an old shoe factory: Pure hard rock brought to you by three bands who are also friends.
After the soundcheck and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians take time for a group photo.
There is no hint of stage fright in the process.
Afterwards, the lead singers and their bands from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all of them associated with the Mosquito booking agency from Oelde - visibly enthrall the approximately 120 visitors of the Mint Mosquito rock night with their loud performances.
Kicking things off, the Tiger Bonesaw quartet around frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika manages to win the crowd with their latest, unknown pieces, which the band penned themselves for their soon to be released CD.
In front of the stage, people dance to the powerful yet harmonious band performance.
Despite loud calls for an encore, Tiger Bonesaw then hand over the reigns to the three-member Here We Stand.
Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass, and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate the variety within hard rock with their alternative sound, which is sometimes reminiscent of 1970s classic rock.
Following the high energy rock of the Tigers, Here We Stand adds a synthesizer on top of the guitar sound.
Among other titles, the yearning, almost ballad-like Take Me Home captivates the audience by switching between melodic passages and the guitar-heavy rock reefs typical of the multi-layered songs.
Meanwhile, the quartet The Ignition from Tönnishäuschen have earned a special reputation since the band formed in 2005.
The band presented their full-energy hard rock on Saturday.
It is obvious and unmistakable that The Ignition have a great deal of stage experience from their performances in front of very large audiences - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 China tour.
Playing off his band, Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann has his very own take on the evening’s only cover - Word Up by Cameo from the 80s.
Meanwhile, it feels like the volume is dialed up even higher than before as guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a solo while running through the cheering crowd.
Of course, when it comes to hard rock concerts, a certain decibel level has to be expected: According to the sound crew, that level was around 98 decibels for the three band concert with Here We Stand, Tiger Bonesaw, and The Ignition during the Mint Mosquito night of rock.
That is approximately the same level as a jackhammer, which is still significantly lower than the peak volumes at Wacken Open Air festival referenced on the band website of The Ignition.
However, the Ahlen audience has no need during this night of rock for 120 decibel sound as loud as a jet engine, as is common at the heavy metal get together in the north of Germany.
After just under four hours, the three hard rock bands have long since won the audience over with their confident, expert performance and own songs.
In the end, all three bands can honestly, if figuratively, say: "Here we stand, having taken the bone saw and ignited a concert evening with the strength of a tiger."
Above all, they enjoyed the plentiful applause from the audience.

One dead in glider accident at Essen / Mülheim Airport
A fatal accident occurred at Mülheim / Essen airport.
On Sunday a glider crashed into the parking lot at Mülheim/Essen airport.
The pilot died in the accident.
Close to Mülheim/Essen airport a fatal accident occurred on Sunday.
As reported by the ‘Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung’, a glider crashed into the parking lot at the airport.
The pilot was reportedly killed.
The WAZ further reported that the student pilot was alone on board - the aircraft was apparently a one-seater.
According to reports, the aircraft had already been on its landing approach at the time of the accident.
The crash site is not far from a marquee within airport premises.
However, starting this weekend, an Oktoberfest is being held.
The Mülheim / Essen airport is located on the city limits of the two Ruhr cities and directly on the ramp to highway 52.
During large events at the Essen conference center or the city’s Grugahalle venue, a park and ride service is offered from the parking lot.

Trump adores Kim: "And then we fell in love"
It is no secret that the US President is well disposed towards North Korea’s ruler Kim, despite the nuclear crisis.
Now Trump has made a real declaration of love to his colleague.
This is also linked to Kim’s ‘wonderful letters’.
At the tender age of 72 years, the married US president has a new flame.
The tragic thing is: It is a long-distance relationship.
On Saturday, in total public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Supporters in the US federal state of West Virginia have heard tender words from Trump for the descendant from the ruling dynasty of Pyongyang half his age, although the struggle for North Korea’s nuclear disarmament is proving to be a particularly tough job.
I was tough and so was he, it went backwards and forwards between us, reported Trump.
Then we fell in love.
OK?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim had brought his heart to melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection also bore fruit politically: Trump pointed to Kim’s announced to halt all nuclear and missile tests, even though critics say it is mere cheap talk.
The US president seemed to be fully aware, that not everyone was fond of the affection for the notorious martial threats of the "Rocket Man" - so Trump’s nickname for Kim.
He accepted the expected criticism during his appearance at a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: ‘Donald Trump says, they have fallen in love’.
How terrible, how terrible is this?
That is so unpresidential.
He cared little for that, said Trump, pointing his finger at the crowd: "I always told you, it is so easy to be presidential."
But 10,000 people outside would not be surging into this packed arena, we would only have 200 people standing outside.

Thanks to video from Libyan prison, refugees are rescued
Nigerian refugees have used a mobile video to point out their catastrophic conditions in Libya which has made it possible for them to be rescued.
At the risk of their lives, the group had shot the video in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July and spread it online.
They refuse to send us back, said a man in the video message.
We are suffering here. We are dying here.
The recording was sent to the website “France 24 Observers,” whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were ultimately flown out to Nigeria at the end of August.
Without the video, we likely would not have been able to return to Nigeria, said Efe Onyeka, who made the video, according to the news agency AFP.
The 25-year old was arrested in Libya when attempting to make her way into Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video, he said he risked his own life.
One of his companions was almost beaten to death by guards, said Onyeka.
In general, the conditions in jail were catastrophic; “They beat all of us with pipes and sticks.”
They didn't give us anything to eat. We had to drink out of the latrine.
The IOM organized the voluntary repatriation of the refugees who were stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back to their home in the West African country this year with the help of the program, said the IOM spokesperson Jorge Galindo.
Given the poor conditions in Libya, this case of the now rescued Nigerians is no exception.
However, a call for help via mobile phone video was new to them.
International organizations are criticizing the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African country, which is largely controlled by militias, is the main country of passage for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.

A German was trapped in his automobile for days
A 75 year old man had to endure several days and nights in his car in a forested area in Middle Franconia, after his car got stuck away from all forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
On Saturday afternoon rescue workers accidentally discovered the car near a meadow and freed the person considered missing since Tuesday evening, the police said on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was apparently found in a healthy conditions despite the cold nights and long period without supplies.
He said he is now pleased to be home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family, when on Tuesday he did not return from a journey in his SUV across local grassland and fields.
The whereabouts of the man remained unclear for days, despite intensive search efforts.

Laschet urges Turkey to act according to the rule of law
Cologne - According to the Minister President of NRW Armin Laschet (CDU), during his talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, called for the rule of law in Turkey.
The relationships of both countries are currently ‘overshadowed’, Laschet said on Saturday, following a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
These concerns are related to all the arrest waves, freedom of media and religion.
He therefore made it clear to Erdogan that "if in the future relations are going to become normal and if economic relations are going to deepen, then the rule of law is a very important condition."
According to Laschet, he also referred to the cases of Germans being imprisoned in Turkey.
He had expressed the hope that freedom of expression would be respected.
Thereupon Erdogan once again underlined the independence of Turkish system of justice.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been transferred to the building of the Executive Transport Wing of the Federal Ministry of Defence at Cologne Airport.
Originally it should have taken place at Wahn castle - but the castle owners declined due to political views against Erdogan.
After the speech Erdogan went to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet declined a joint appearance in the building.
He did say though: ‘The Muslims who go to this mosque, are also citizens of our country’.
And we are their contact persons - and not the Turkish president.

Lack of trust in the US: North Korea demands disarmament
While US President, Trump does not tire of highlighting the success of negotiations over North Korea’s denuclearization, the East Asian regime is describing relations more demurely.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for a concession from Washington.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho, speaking at the UN General Debate, has accused the US government of stalling negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula through continued sanctions.
The recent standstill has seen the US implementing coercive measures, which are lethal to trust-building, said Ri in New York.
Disarmament under these circumstance would be unthinkable for North Korea.
Without any trust in the US, there is no trust in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way that we can disarm ourselves first, the North Korean head diplomat said.
The idea that North Korea could be ‘brought to its knees’ due to the sanctions, is ‘a pipe dream of people who don’t know us’.
To build trust his country has stopped its atom and missile tests and has destroyed a nuclear test system, Ri said.
However, the USA has shown no "corresponding reactions" to that, the minister criticised.
Last year alone, because of North Korea’s nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council passed sanctions on the internationally isolated country three times.
In recent days the US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been pushing for strict adherence to the sanctions at the United Nations.
Concurrently, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump first met with North Korea’s ruler, Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore the US President is aiming for a second summit meeting with Kim.
In October, Pompeo will be traveling to Pyongyang again for talks about the termination of the North Korean nuclear weapons program.

The HoT served: New kitchen with donations from the community
The many visitors of the House of the Open Door (HoT) didn’t realise the fact that they were actually in a youth club: White blankets and floral decorations on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
Youth from the HoT had conjured up the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The facility was financed by donations from the community, for which the youth wanted to express their thanks with the meal.
The start was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, head of the HoT, remembers.
We had already filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break, and we were well prepared for the big day.
But then the bad surprise came on the first day after the summer break: A power outage had cut the power to the huge two-part refrigerator, the food was spoiled and had to be thrown out.
Now we had to start from the beginning again: We got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and youth wanted to do it alone, says Westbuer.
And so everyone helped.
The result was impressive and the guests were excited.
Professional chefs could not do any better either, an impressed visitor said, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served and the guests enjoyed quiche, meatloaf or cake.
It is really great what the children and young people have put together, said pastor Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen amazed the guests with card tricks and other performances.

Jürgen Sator leaves the NRW executive board of the Tafel
Out of frustration over criticism from their own ranks, the head of the Essen Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has given up his position.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essen Tafel had introduced a limit for foreigners.
He had resigned in July as vice-chairman of the NRW Tafel, said Sartor to the "Welt am Sonntag".
Too many had stabbed me in the back.
The head of the NRW association of the Tafel, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed understanding for the decision of his longtime deputy to dpa.
Sartor took the sharp criticism to heart.
I can understand his step - many people spoke up who did not even know exactly why the Essen Tafel does that.
But Sartor is still working for the Essener Tafel - “six days a week, nothing has changed about it,” says Weilerswist.
Sartor criticized colleagues from other Tafel associations in "Welt am Sonntag.".
One should not think, "that without us, people in the city would be starving."
It would be the government’s obligation to ensure that people did not starve to death.
The man from Essen did not participate at a congress of the Tafel in Berlin on Friday.
They’re oversimplifying it all, he said.
There are all those do-gooders who criticized me so much back then.

It was a very different story for TV Heuchlingen: In Kirchheim, TVH quickly fell behind with 0:1, but victory was theirs after 90 minutes at 2:1. Meanwhile a 3:0 for SGB at the top of the table allowed them to

Gladbach forfeits double lead - Schalke without Embolo receives first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach must wait for an away win in Wolfsburg.
At 2: 2 "die Fohlen" twice forfeited the lead.
Schalke gains its first win of the season with a score of 1:0 over Mainz.
(sda) Four times Schalke maneuvered themselves offside with early goals in the first five league games.
Now, the team of Domenico Tedesco again showed the same strength, which allowed it to take the first place behind Bayern last season.
Alessandro Schöpf secured the lead of the home team in the eleventh minute after heavy preparatory head work by Yevgeny Konoplyanka, as a result of which the home team preserved the mini buffer with a solid defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback Borussia Dortmund are moving back up the national league again.
The team of Lucien Favre playing against Bayer Leverkusen by half-time had brought itself to a 0:2 loss, but in the second half came to a 4:2 win.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) with a doublet within four minutes brought the game to a tie. Paco Alcacer, who was sent to the field by Favre in the 63rd minute as a substitute, provided another doublet in the closing stages of the came (86./94.) as the crowning conclusion of the performance increase after the break.
The VfB Stuttgart also received its first victory.
The Stuttgarters had to take fear of the Werder Bremen, which already before the end of the first half-time had been reduced to a team of ten because of a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler fabricated a strange throw-in own goal, which helpd the guests tie the game in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to its first win.
Michael Lang playing in Wolfsburg, did not experience a completely successful, but neither a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbachers, using the Swiss quartett line-up of Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang gave away the lead twice, but ultimately achieved a 2:2 score, which means that since the year 2003 they still await an away win in the VW city.
Renato Steffen was responsible for the 1:1 tie goal for Wolfsburg, which was his second goal in the Bundesliga.
The Aargauer Yann Sommer was powerless against the low shot from 20 metres, as well as against the second goal against an hour later.
The trends at Gladbach are very promising though.
Alassane Pléa proves to be a goalgetter in the ofensive of "die Fohlen".
Against Wolfsburg hit The French record purchase from the OGC Nice scored against Wolfsburg for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in seven competitive matches.
After seven rounds Gladbach holds 4th place.
Within 40 minutes the previously undefeated Werder Bremen put VfB Stuttgart in an uncomfortable position.
After 19 minutes, Florian Kohlfeldt’s team were surprised by Stuttgart’s counter-attack, when the ex-Lugano Anastasios Donis scored his first goal of the season, after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic was added to the team: The 23-year-old Serbian got a yellow/red after a shirt-pull against Daniel Didavi.
Although Stuttgart’s defender Borna Sosa and goalie Ron-Robert Zieler Bremer, through a strange throw-in own goal (68) brought Bremen back into the game, a quarter of an hour before closing a shot by Gonzalo Castro led the majority owning Stuttgart team back to the road to victory.
Nuremberg won the battle against Düsseldorf 3:0, effortlessly.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens brought the home team on track with a foul penalty.

Macedonians are to agree on a new state name
In Macedonia around 1.8 million citizens will today agree whether the name of their country in North Macedonia should be changed.
A yes could help settle the dispute with neighboring Greece that has been simmering for nearly three decades.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its eponymous northern province and sought to block any Macedonian advances to the West.
Voters are therefore also deciding on the country’s future integration into the West.
The USA have announced that the country could quickly become a Nato member if there is a positive outcome from the referendum.

Syrian detained awaiting trial.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat three senior citizens partially causing severe injuries.
On Friday at about 22.00 the 41-year-old asylum seeker had rioted in the Fluchtgasse in Alsergrund.
When the policemen arrived, they questioned the accused about his behavior, who with clenched fists attempted to attack passers-by.
The Syrian thereafter tried to beat and kick the officials.
A short time later it turned out that the suspect had recently beaten three older ladies (aged 65, 67, 75) in the Währinger street, at a tram stop with his fists bringing them to the ground.
Additionally he stomped on the trio with his feet.
The senior citizens were partially seriously injured.
They suffered hematoma, bruising and concussion.
The police stated, the asylum seeker was also seriously injured, "through causes still requiring identification."
He was taken to hospital and monitored throughout his treatment.

SPD Politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his boyfriend
Almost a year after marriage came into force for everyone, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-term boyfriend Christoph Rohde.
The two exchanged vows on Saturday in Hamburg.
Kahrs previously told the ‘Bild’ newspaper that a registered civil partnership was not for them.
If we get married, we want to do it properly. He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs speaks on budgetary policy for the SPD parliamentary group in the German Bundestag and is one of the Seeheim region speakers of the conservative SPD wing.
Kahrs had caused quite a stir with an angry speech on June 30, 2017 during a parliamentary debate over allowing homosexuals to get married.
For example, he accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the subject.
He felt this was its Schabowski moment, alluding to the inadvertent announcement of the East German border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017 same-sex couples have been able to marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality of status with marriage, for example concerning adoption laws.

Garden day: 400 meters of hedge trimmed
The members of the citizens’ association Kinderhaus and the Gesellschaft für Leprakunde were faced with a lot of work.
Because around 400 meters of hedge around the gardens of the residents of the Pfründnerhause had to be trimmed.
Supported by the residents, about twelve helpers went to work.
We are doing this to reduce costs, explained the chairman of the citizens’ association Walter Schröer.
And a lot of costs have accumulated.
Because of the hot summer, we're late getting started, but fortunately it’s just some profile trimming.
Because they had already cut the hedge in the spring.
The breakfast that always follows the work also has a long tradition.
Everyone should eat to have enough energy, said Walter Schröer.

World championships in Rio: Hannes Aigner receives gold at the canoe slalom world championships
The Augsburg Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the end of the canoe slalom world championships in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old completed a perfect run on the Olympic stretch.
Two years ago, he missed the Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, having done plenty of runs on this setup, and today everything went perfectly’, said the Olympic bronze medalist from London 2012.
At the finish line, he threw away his paddle for joy and victoriously stretched both arms into the air - knowing that it would at least be enough for a medal.
After all, he started at number four.
Yet the six remaining starters could not top his best time of 89.69 seconds.
The Czech, Jiri Prskavec came second in front of the Russian, Pawel Eigel.

The Gauting police inspection announces the first attempted break-in this autumn in a single-family house.
Fortunately, the culprits failed.
The days are getting shorter - burglars are taking advantage of this.
Yesterday the police station Gauting reported the first break-in attempt of this autumn.
It is thanks to the alarm system that the attempt in the Königswieser Straße at the single family home remained as such.
On Friday just before 20.00 the alarm rang when the offenders took action.
The burglars assumed the inhabitants were not at home.
Yet apparently the alarm surprised them so much that they fled without loot.
Useful info to the PD Gauting, phone (089) 8 93 13 30.

The fall of Hertha: Overtaken by reality: Bayern calls for Ajax
The title of unbeatable is gone: The defeat in Berlin will not allow the FC Bayern to give up.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach will now determine the interim conclusion for Niko Kovac’s tenure.
Under no circumstances should the first small drop in power with the new coach Niko Kovaca should increase for Munich to the autumn minimum.
A week ago, everyone still thought we were unbeatable.
Now we are overtaken by reality, said Thomas Müller after the 0-2 defeat of Hertha BSC and asks for a return leg in the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us, is aware that we are really angry and that is why we will crank up on Tuesday.
For the first time within more than a year of playing away there were scored no goals, as at the same time two mandatory preseason games in series without a victory, the league leaders in the Bundesliga lost to Borussia Dortmund.
The overall situation is not nearly as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, but the champions shall be aware.
The FC Augsburg with the 1:1 ratio having its long running man-on-man tactics and the Berlin through its playful pinpricks over the outside have delivered within two days two similar blueprints, as the last overpowering appearing of Bayern failed.
Those who know Bayern are aware that we will not put up with that and that we will do everything to become successful again, Kovac said.
Apart from this, he quietly bypassed his native city with his losers and put his first defeat as Munich coach down to the inadequate handling of opportunities.
A win over Amsterdam and Borussia Monchengladbach on Saturday would make the first preliminary conclusion of his term being positive before the international break - otherwise the tone will probably get worse.
So before the second premier class appearance in this season after the 2-0 over Benfica Lisbon, Kovac undertook no extraordinary measures.
As it was planned, after the day off on Sunday started quick preparation for the second preliminary round match against Ajax, who beat AEK Athens confidently 3-0 as well.
Now they’ve scored a victory over us in two games, but we will also reach our goals again, announced captain of the national team Manuel Neuer.
Already after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt, at the same position the most notably in plain text spoke Joshua Kimmich.
The right defender take on the role of admonisher.
I do not believe that this is all bad luck, we need to work it out again, because we do not go for most of the opportunities and make mistakes, said the 23-year-old shortly before leaving the Olympic stadium.
On the seventh match day of the previous season Bayern was even five points behind Dortmund, which has now taken over with one point ahead.
And so Kimmich appreciated only with a shrug of its shoulders at least positively, that now the public debate about supposedly invincible Bavaria has ended.
Yes, that’s good, said the national player.
It is a good thing for the league.

DFB boss comes under fire: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack of Erdogan on Grindel
The Turkish president Erdogan condemns the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany amidst serious accusations.
The DFB president Grindel admits mistakes but upholds the association’s line.
Now will be created a new post.
Berlin - Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought on different stages for interpretation in the lengthy Mesut Özil dispute.
After the Turkish President criticized the speech of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of large Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the head of DFB upheld the association’s line.
Early on Sunday morning, Grindl, who had been personally attacked by Özil, reported on the consequences of the issue on the Mainz ZDF “Sport studio”.
As we have a lot of players with a migration background in the U teams, in future we must draw very specific conclusions, so something like this this does not happen again, said the 57-year-old and plans to get a national player without a migration background as an additional integration official.
Grindel also explained again that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
The latter was very critical of the racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our Mesut Özil, born and raised in Germany, and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this association because they allowed me to be photographed with them in England," said Erdogan in Domstadt on Saturday.
Frankly speaking, as their president, I could not accept the fact that our two young men, who had been risen to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel pointed at Gündogan's statement that in contrast to Özil, after the World Cup affair, which had been taken photos of the two with Erdogan, he felt that he was "reasonably treated by the DFB".
He also said he wanted to stand up for players in future.
That thing they say: If I win - I’m German, if I lose - I’m a migrant - that will not work.
I am very sorry that he had such an impression, said Grindel.
I’ve always said that we had to defend Mesut more.
Yet he does not see grounds for Özil to return to the national team.
As a consequence, in addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic of Cameroon ancestry, now should be appointed an additional integration representative.
If somebody without a migration background is an obvious influencer in society and football and says: The issue is an important one, we need to do something about it’, this would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our local teams, where integration needs to work’, Grindel said.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he wants to run for the post of DFB President again next year.
I do my work and take care I do it as well as possible, Grindel said.

Elderly creates three accidents within three hours
Coburg / Roedental - As reported by the police, on Friday between the hours of 10 and 13, the 75 year old caused the accidents.
First, the 75 year old driver spoke with a lady at the red traffic light in the area of the Lauterer Höhe.
She informed the senior citizen that he had driven against her car.
No exchange of personal data occured as the 75 year old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later the police received a report by phone about an automobile driver who had come off the road and driven into a reflector post.
When asked, the man did not want the police on the scene and then drove off.
Afterwards the Rödental native drove home.
However, the retiree in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, got lost and while making a turn rammed a construction vehicle.
Finally, the police were able to find and stop him.
His car showed clear signs of damage from accidents.
The 75-year-old made a confusing impression and could not recall much.
The damages amounted to approx. 1 300 Euros.

Moorland Fire in Meppen: Still nearly 1000 forces on site.
About four weeks after the outbreak of moorland fires on a Bundeswehr site in Emsland, 980 emergency forces are still busy with firefighting operations.
The federal armed forces announced this on Sunday.
70 volunteers were recently withdrawn since, according to a spokesman, the situation continues to be stable.
Also it was reported, that a further withdrawal of emergency forces is planned.
On Sunday night, an above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the state of emergency was lifted, which had been proclaimed a week earlier on September 21th, because it had been feared that the flames would spread by wind and flying sparks and thus endanger adjacent forests and settlements.
On thursday, it was reported that there is no longer a threat of the fire spreading to adjacent communities.
At times more than 1,500 deployment forces on site attempted to get the big fire under control.
The German Air Force used a transport helicopter to support the work on the German Federal Armed Forces test site near Meppen.
There are also reconnaissance flights with the Bundeswehr's drones.
According to the German Federal Armed Forces, reconnaissance flights with “Tornadoes” are again planned for October 2 and 5.
The fire was caused by test rockets, which the Airbus technicians had fired off.
The smoke draught of the moorland fires went up to a hundred kilometers far, even farther than the northwest of Germany, up to Bremen at times.
On Monday, the German Federal Armed Forces wants to set up a contact center to receive damage reports.
The first damage claims have already been announced by hoteliers and vacation home owners.

SPD Politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his boyfriend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly a year after marriage became available for everyone, the politician has married his longtime boyfriend in Hamburg.
The two have been together for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost a year after marriage came into force for everyone, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-term boyfriend Christoph Rohde.
The two exchanged vows on Saturday in Hamburg.
Kahrs previously told the “Bild” newspaper that a registered civil partnership was not for them.
If we get married, then right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the fiscal policy speaker for the SPD parliamentary group in the German Bundestag and is one of the Seeheim region speakers of the conservative SPD wing.
On June 30, 2017 Kahrs caused a huge stir about the opening of marriage to homosexuals in the Bundestag debate.
He had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "stumbling" on the subject.
He felt this was its Schabowski moment, alluding to the inadvertent announcement of the East German border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017 same-sex couples have been able to marry just like heterosexuals.
Before this they were able to register their civil partnership from 2001, but there was no equality in terms of marriage and the right to adopt.

Referendum over a new state name has begun in Macedonia
In Macedonia the eagerly anticipated referendum for a new name for this small Balkan state, has started.
About 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in future.
Neighboring Greece insists that it should due its eponymous northern province.
As a lever, Athens had blocked any rapprochement between Skopje and the EU and NATO for almost three decades.
If the citizens vote yes, they also give the starting signal for their country's integration into the West.

Switzerland is starting an electronic register for organ donors
The register should facilitate organ donations and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
Swisstransplant emphasizes that the new process will not change the way organs are only extracted with express consent.
(dpa) Switzerland starts its electronic register for organ donation this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donations and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
Those who want to donate their organs in cases of death, can register themselves.
Your wishes will then be available to Swisstransplant, if required.
Swisstransplant emphasizes that the new process will not change the way organs are only extracted with express consent, as is the case in Germany.
It is assumed that 15 percent of the Swiss have donor cards, says Franz Immer, Director of the Swisstransplant foundation.
But only in five percent of cases, a card is found at the crucial moment when donating is possible.
In over 60 percent of conversations, relatives do not know the dead person’s intentions.
You then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, according to their wish, which is often very stressful, says Immer.
A similar registration system already exists in Great Britain.
In Germany, the recording of details about possible organ donation on the health card has been considered, as stated by the speaker for the Federal Office for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert.
There is no register where people can record their wishes, for or against organ donation, she says.
Federal Health Minister has spoken about new guidelines for organ donation.
According to his suggestion, everyone will be considered an organ donor, unless he/she or relatives contradict this.
Among others, the Catholic Church objects the proposed regulation.

14-year-old pupil is a world champion in mental arithmetic
The 14-year-old pupil Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is the world champion in mental arithmetic.
On the weekend he defeated 39 competitors in Wolfsburg.
On Sunday the announcement was made by Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Science Museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest world champion participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese pupil, the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as reported by head judge Ralf Laue.
Every two years the competition is organised by the computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony).
Examples of previous tasks included are: 14 130 214 x 17 981 822 or 57 809 355 + 28 x 16 448 333.
On Saturday afternoon there was a show where competitors competed against guests with calculators among the audience as spectators are not allowed to watch the competition.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he can keep a ball in the air while calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries, tried to qualify for the competition.
Two years ago Grüß as a 14 year old, at the time, was present in Bielefeld.
With terms like super brain, genius or prodigy, the organiser Laue can do little with.
It is possible to train in mental arithmetic, he said.
Many participants trained several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even computing competitions set up in stadiums.
Square root extraction from six-digit numbers, for example, is also included in the disciplines.
In the various calculations, the candidates get surprise tasks, for which they need to find a solution strategy.
The main judge said the Germans also had a good chance.
Otherwise, Asians are often at an advantage as already in early childhood mental arithmetic is learned more intensively and with other, effective methods.

Urgent appeal: Video with naked Serena Williams: It’s all about early detection of breast cancer
Tennis star Serena Williams shows her emotional and sensitive side.
With this video the 37-year-old wants to draw attention to breast cancer and speak up for its early diagnosing.
It is about life and death, but also courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings up the song "I Touch Myself" of the group "The Divinyls" topless with only hands covering her most intimate parts.
The singer, Chrissy Amphlett, died because of it.
The emotional video is part of the ‘I Touch Myself’ project, about how the early recognition of breast cancer, can save lives.
Serena Williams herself could have died a year ago.
There were some complications when she was giving birth to her daughter Alexis Olympia.
To save the baby’s life an emergency surgery was started.
In a subsequent CT in Serena’s lung were discovered blood clots.
Just in time...

Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The federal government plans to extend the ban on using extremist symbols.
Next week the turquoise blue coalition is sending a relevant draft legislation on the so-called “Symbol Law" for appraisal.
As a result, there will be an obvious increase in the number of terrorist or comparable groups, caught by this ban.

Cold polar air is bringing fresh snow to the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle will be shaking out her beds for the first time in the west next week: Cold polar air will reach the Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg regions on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snow fall limit sinks to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - it was reported, that in narrow valleys, there might be intense snowfalls to about 1,000 meters.
20 to 40 cm of fresh snow is to be expected above 2,000 meters from the Bregenz Forest to the High Tauern mountain range.
Therefore, road conditions on higher mountain pass roads (Arlberg Pass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brenner Pass, Gerlos Pass, Felbertauern, Grossglockner High Alpine Road) may be wintry.

On Monday farmers are allowed to start the annual hedge bank maintainance
On Monday Schleswig-Holstein farmers can start with the annual hedge bank maintainance.
For around 200 years, the "green ramparts" which are unique in Germany, have shaped the landscape of the forest-poor state.
The tree and undergrowth hedges, up to five meters wide, are ‘forest replacements’ and for many animals and plants are the last areas of retreat.
Hedge banks connect as corridors scattered habitats, through which the exchange of organisms can still function, as the executive director of the Nature And Biodiversity Conservation Union (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Hedge banks are living fences
In the year 1766 the hedge banks were created at the command of the Danish King Christian VI who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The ‘living fences’ were not just field boundaries and cattle fencing, they also provided farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
From that time comes the name "Knick": By "bending over" (Umknicken) the branches, the dense, intertwined boundaries could develop.
Today, around 45 000 kilometers of hedgerows stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, giving the image of a wooded, diversely structured landscape.
According to the NABU’s details they are used by approximately 7,000 animal species as an alternative habitat.
One kilometre of hedge bank may contain up to 1 800 different species and up to 30 pairs of birds may breed there.
The hedge banks can only fulfill their ecologically important role if they are maintained accordingly in the winter.
Otherwise, it is stunted to a sparse tree line, which causes not only losses in biodiversity but also in the windbreaking effect, said Ludwichowski.
The hedge bank maintenance, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, can only take place outside the breeding period or from October until March.

After the tsunami on Sulawesi an Indonesian talks about local situation
The local Radika Pinto describes the local situation on Sulawesi island following the earthquakes and tsunami in the interview with RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND):
Were you on location when the tsunami took place?
No, I was in Jakarta on Java island at the time.
At the time of the earthquakes, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I heard about the tsunami, I immediately returned to Sulawesi.
I arrived there on Sunday morning, because I still had to drive for more than 20 hours by car after the flight as the airport at Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has opened the airport again, so aid supply can be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, which were completely destroyed.
Our ‘World Vision’ office is also destroyed, but we have set something up provisionally, where other people have also been accommodated.
Where are the people of Sulawesi living now?
Many ran to the surrounding hills, where they held out through fear of another tsunami and earthquake, and where there is no access to water and food.
Many stopped in front of their houses with aftershocks still being experienced.
As many food shops and gas stations are completely shut, some people are stealing provisions and gasoline.
The public services have completely shut down and the national government is helping.
Even a prison was destroyed, the prisoners are running around free, and searching for them is difficult.
There are still lots of bodies lying around, many people have not been found and are missing.
How is the communication and information flow on the island?
At the moment we have mobile reception, which did not work previously and we have been receiving information via radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other persons, not knowing if they are alive and where they are staying, because people were not at home during the earthquake and were on the way to work, for example.
The tsunami warning system did not work correctly.
Do you have any information about this?
We do not know the reasons for this, but when the all-clear was given, many people thought ‘OK, no tsunami’, and then it came.
In other regions not affected by the tsunami, there was false information about a tsunami hitting the region and they ran to the surrounding hills.
An island like Sulawesi that sits on the Pacific rim of fire, is not prepared for earthquakes?
Yet there are earthquakes every day, but this one was the worst.
We normally know how to react to an earthquake and are trained for evacuations.
But the complete infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has affected a lot of people.

Muscle injuries to Werder: VfB has to do without Aogo and Donis
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missed for a long time in the VfB Stuttgart's line-up due to serious muscle injuries.
Aogo tore a muscle fiber in his rear left thigh during a 2:1 win against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the Bundesliga soccer team announced on Sunday.
Donis was diagnosed with a torn muscle bundle in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably also miss matches after the international cap break.
A downtime forecast was not given by VfB Stuttgart.
A torn muscle bundle usually heals within six to eight weeks, a torn muscle fibre usually heals a little faster.

Triumph of hyperrealism at San Sebástian film festival
San Sebastián - Each year, the Film Festival of San Sebastián closes the season of Europe’s most prestigious festivals.
Despite all the talk of cinema’s demise one can summarize: 2018 was a remarkable year for the movies.
After an impressive contest in Cannes, with particularly strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a festival in Venice, which attracted much attention for its Oscar hopefuls from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of its best competitions in recent years.

On Sunday morning the Olching fire department tried to capture an injured duck.
However, the operation took some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - On Sunday morning walkers along the Olchinger See noticed a white, injured duck.
It stopped in the area of the water safety station.
Passers-by called the police and fire department to help the animal.
The first attempts to catch the duck went wrong however.
Despite its injury, it continued to dodge the emergency services.
In the end the duck fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade could circle the animal and push it back ashore, where after almost an hour it was then put in a transport box with a courageous grip by a firefighter.
The duck, with an injured breast, was then taken to the LMU’s animal hospital in Oberschleißheim.
However, initial assessments revealed that its chances of surviving were fairly low.

Biathlete Julian Eberhard aims for the World Championship medal
Biathlete Julian Eberhard was sad for a long time about fourth place at the Olympics.
In the coming winter, the Saalfelden native wants to catch up on the missed medal at the world championship in Östersund.
The 31 year old’s last shot cost him the medal that was within his grasp in the Olympic sprint at Pyeonchang.
Seven tenths of a second cost him the bronze in the end.
I deliberately gave myself time to process this, says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his home town of Saalfelden.
My goal was to win a medal. I was in peak form, but it just wasn’t to be.
The Pinzgau region native is all the more motivated to catch up on the missed medal in the new season: "The goal can only be to go to a major event to win something.
At some point you have to win.
The world championship cross-country ski run in Östersund, Sweden is Eberhard's: “I have already taken the track to heart,” he says as he happily remembers his fourth place world cup finish in the individual race last year.
Right after the Olympics, he celebrated Austria’s only individual victory in the last world cup winter in the mass start competition in Kontiolahti, Finland.
In Oslo (NOR), he managed second place.

Joint Report on Parallel Audits of Expenditure on the Construction of the Motorway Prague – Dresden
Background
Without the trans-European motorway networks the high traffic volumes between the member states in modern, united Europe would be subject to considerable constraints and losses in quality.
High-quality transport networks are essential for maintaining and raising Europeans’ standard of living.
Putting in place the right conditions for fast, safe, reliable and efficient passenger and freight transport is an important government task.
Performing this task is a highly demanding exercise in organisational, technical and financial terms.
When putting into place and extending a sustainable European transport infrastructure system, decision-makers often have to reach difficult compromises with European and national policy interests, for example, in preserving the environment.
Building transport infrastructure is expensive, especially owing to the environmental protection measures that are required.
Carefully considered action and decision-making by government departments when preparing and procuring transport construction may bring significant savings of public funds that can be channelled into other beneficial uses.
One of the tasks of audit institutions is to identify shortcomings that prevent ensuring the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of expenditure on the construction of transport infrastructure.
Audit institutions should not merely draw government departments’ attention to the shortcomings identified; they should also recommend measures designed to improve the state of affairs, to the benefit of citizens and to the benefit of Europe.
Summary
In 2005 and 2006, the two supreme audit institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic, the Bundesrechnungshof (BRH) and the Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad (NKÚ) conducted parallel audits of expenditure on the construction of the motorway Prague – Dresden (D 8 motorway in the Czech Republic and the A 17 motorway in the Federal Republic of Germany).
The motorways are connected by a border bridge co-financed by the two countries.
By working together with the NKÚ, the BRH was able to audit in depth the efficiency of the funds used for building the border bridge.
As a result of working closely with the BRH the NKÚ was furnished for comparative purposes with the necessary data of German cost levels of bridges and tunnels.
In the year 2000 the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany concluded a treaty on building a border bridge.
In accordance with the construction progress, the completion date was finally scheduled for the end of 2006.
During the public procurement process, however, the Roads and Motorways Directorate of the Czech Republic (hereinafter “RMD”) committed errors that led to the tender being prolonged and time for construction shortened.
The contract with the contractor was therefore signed later than envisaged.
The contractor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter time and ensure completion in 2006.
As a result, the RMD had to accept a considerable increase in the price of the bridge.
As part of the joint audit effort motorway bridges on the D 8 and A 17 were compared based on the prices per square metre of area of the bridge structure.
The statistical analysis of prices made it possible to identify bridges that came at a high cost per square metre.
This analysis revealed that the border bridge was the most expensive bridge as compared to other large bridges having a length of over 100 metres.
The price increase could also be attributed to the delays occurred in the tender procedure.
When auditors analysed the costs of tunnel structures they found that the prices of tunnels are considerably higher on the D 8 motorway than the prices of comparable tunnels in Germany.
The BRH and NKÚ now possess a database of prices for bridges and tunnels on which they can rely in future audit missions into the efficiency of the funds used for transport infrastructure purposes.
Concerning the construction of bridges the two audit institutions recommend the following: standardising bridge constructions and using composite steel-concrete and special structures only if prestressed steelconcrete bridges are not adequate.
The main features of the cooperation were teamwork and informality.
Throughout the parallel audit, the auditors shared their specific knowledge and skills.
Introduction
This report informs about the conduct and the results of parallel audit missions regarding the funds spent on the construction of the motorway connecting Dresden and Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and the A 17 in Germany).
The audit missions focused on the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the expenditure occurred.
The parallel audits were performed by the BRH in Germany and NKÚ in the Czech Republic.
The parallel audit work was conducted in the years 2005 and 2006.
The NKÚ scrutinised the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of approximately CZK 20 billion incl. VAT in expenditure (approx. € 690 million) on the border section of the D 8 motorway, which is numbered 0807.
Out of this amount € 64 million were planned to be used from European funds (ISPA).
Apart from the parallel audit work undertaken conjunctively with the NKÚ the BRH had audited the planning and construction of motorway A 17 in the years 2003 and 2005.
The funds used for building all three sections of the A 17 motorway amounted to some € 670 million, where € 277 million will be co-financed by European funds (EFRE).
The motorway from Prague to Dresden is part of the Dresden – Central Eastern and South Eastern Europe – Istanbul Pan-European Transport Corridor IV.
The D 8 runs from Prague to the state frontier via Usti nad Labem.
The A 17 runs from the Czech/German border to Dresden.
At the time of audit, the frontier sections of both motorways were under construction.
These sections have been opened on December 21, 2006.
While on the German side the motorway is completed up to Dresden, on the Czech side, the D 8 is not completed, because section No. 0805 at a length of 16.4 km through the Central Bohemian Highlands between Rehlovice and ovosice is still in the preparatory phase.
The stretch 0805 between Prague and Ústí nad abem is planned to pass through the Protected Countryside Area in the Central Bohemian Highlands.
According to forecasts performed in the Czech Republic in 2001, traffic volume on the border section No. 0807 of the D 8 motorway should be 22 940 vehicles per day in 2008.
According to German forecasts traffic volumes at the Czech border will total some 25 000 vehicles per day in the year 2010.
In the year 2000, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic signed a Treaty on connecting German Motorway A 17 and Czech Motorway D 8 on the common state frontiers by constructing a border bridge.
Since the two states participated in building the bridge; examining the construction of the individual bridge was therefore an important aspect of parallel audit missions by the two audit institutions.
Cooperation between BRH and NKÚ
From mid 2005, the two supreme audit institutions discussed to work closely in auditing the construction of the motorway connecting Prague and Dresden.
Both sides had important reasons for this cooperation:
1.
Germany co-finances the construction of the border bridge.
Planning and construction are incumbent on the Czech road construction administration.
Therefore, the BRH had no possibility of auditing this construction project itself.
2.
The NKÚ did not have a comparative database needed for assessing whether the funds were used economically regarding the overall cost level of bridges and tunnels on the D 8.
3.
The NKÚ needed to examine the effectiveness of expenditure by looking at the motorway’s principal technical parameters, and particularly the arrangement of bridges and tunnels that were meant to provide the same level of quality of use on both sides of the border.
After preparatory negotiations, an Agreement on the Coordinated Audit of the D 8/A 17 Motorway was signed on January 4, 2006 by the presidents of the two supreme audit institutions.
Joint working meetings between BRH and NKÚ auditors took place throughout 2006 at roughly six to eight week intervals.
The meetings addressed current problems and tasks, in particular the preparation of a uniform methodology for auditing the prices of bridges and tunnels, information exchange regarding findings arising from the audit of the construction of the border bridge and the preparation of joint reports.
A significant feature of the cooperation was the continuous sharing of information.
While the BRH did most of the comparative work on the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels and the contracting procedures, the NKÚ prepared most of the methodology for scrutinising the prices of bridges and tunnels.
In accordance with applicable relevant government audit legislation in the two countries, there are differences in the manner of concluding audit missions in Germany and Czech Republic.
For this reason, the two supreme audit institutions drew up each a separate national report on its audit findings produced.
The present report reflects the results achieved in the parallel audit missions.
The cooperation will be ended by the signing of a final communiqué in the first half of 2007.
Construction of the border bridge
In the Treaty as of the year 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed on a deadline for completing the border bridge, according to their capabilities, in 2005.
They both agreed to postpone this deadline to the end of 2006.
The RMD acted as investor.
Germany co-finances the construction of the bridge by 42.13 %.
In the period up to 1999, RMD had proposed that the border bridge should have a prestressed steel-concrete structure.
In 1999 by agreement with its partners in Germany RMD approved a composite steel-concrete structure.
They justified this decision by referring to the reduction of pillar pairs from seven to five and the resulting ecological benefit for the valley.
In addition, a comparative calculation done by RMD stated that the composite steel-concrete structure would be the less costly option.
But there was an error in the calculation.
The calculation stated that the new composite steel-concrete structure would be only 397 m long.
In fact, it is 5% longer.
RMD committed grave errors in the public procurement procedure.
RMD failed to prepare tender documents adequately describing both assessment criteria and sub-criteria used for comparing the bids.
This error resulted in subjective and ambiguous assessment by the bids evaluation commission and the managing director respectively.
A non-successful bidder contested the results of the tender procedure.
The subsequent inquiry by the Office for the Protection of Competition caused the bridge construction contract to be signed later than originally anticipated.
That meant that 2004 year summer building season after bid evaluation was lost, and the time for construction of the bridge was shortened.
The constructor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter time, but this involved a substantial price increase.
The steps offered included dual assembly of the bridge superstructures, a change in the pillar design and erecting an assembly facility.
In addition, the constructor was unable to obtain the originally proposed type of steel in the time required.
The new type of steel – at a higher cost of some € 4 million borne fully by RMD – made it possible to shorten the time for performing anti-corrosion protection, which subsequently made it possible to cut the overall time needed to build the border bridge.
Compared to the price offered in the bid of some € 18.3 million net, as a result of the accelerated procedure and further funding adjustments, the total cost of the border bridge will rise considerably.
Shortened time for works resulted in price increase in the range of some € 5.9 million.
Currently net costs amount to some € 25.9 million not considering price escalation (as of October 2006).
Comparison of the prices of bridges and tunnels
The two supreme audit institutions analysed the prices of bridges on the D 8 and A 17 in order to identify bridges whose price was excessively high, and compare the prices of bridges on the German and Czech sides.
The analysis relied on arithmetical statistics.
Tunnels on the D 8 were also compared with equivalent tunnels on motorways (A 71, A 38 and A 4) in Germany;
there were no similar tunnels on the A 17 motorway.
In preparing this part of the audit, it was important to identify relevant prices accurately.
The main principles determined by the two supreme audit institutions for comparing the prices of bridges included the following: to rely on the actual price paid for the bridge without value added tax (VAT rates in the Czech Republic and Germany differ and are subject to change); not to consider prices for special bridge foundations; to convert prices in CZK into € using the European Central Bank rate applicable on 30.12.2005 (CZK 29 = € 1).
Bridges of various construction types (such as steel concrete, prestressed steel-concrete, composite steel-concrete and steel) and various sizes are found on both the D 8 and A 17.
In an effort to homogenise the reviewed bridge constructions, the bridges were divided into categories based on construction type.
Within these categories the bridge size was also taken into account in the analyses.
Concrete bridges were by far the most common type of construction on both sides of the border (20 bridges on the D 8 and 36 bridges on the A 17).
The analysis focused chiefly on this category of bridge, as the large size of the sample made it possible to use arithmetical statistics and improved the reliability of results.
Audit work revealed that the prices per m2 of concrete bridges on the D 8 and A 17 depend on the bridge size (its length, area): the bigger the bridge, the lower the price per m 2 of the bridge.
The correlation between price and size is stronger for German bridges than Czech bridges (see graphs below).
Two concrete bridges were identified on the A 17 and four on the D 8 whose price is markedly higher.
These bridges were identified partly by a method enabling the ascertainment of atypical values in a set of numbers and partly by regressive analysis taking into account the correlation between the bridge price and its size (distance above the regressive curve is a key to identifying atypically expensive bridges).
Information about the atypically high price of the said bridges should, however, be regarded merely as an indicator as to which bridges to focus on.
In order to be able to make a generally applicable conclusion the causes of the high price would have to be analysed in each identified case.
One reason may be inefficient administrative action but it may also have been caused by environmental protection requirements or any other acceptable reasons.
Given that the Czech concrete bridges are on average longer than the German ones (see table below), the proven negative correlation between the bridge price and length might lead one to expect that they would be cheaper.
The hypothesis about the lower cost of Czech concrete bridges is also supported by the lower cost of labour in the construction industry in the Czech Republic than in Germany.
The results of the analysis, however, indicate that the price of concrete bridges on the D 8 is higher than on the A 17.
Two possible reasons for this state of affairs were identified during joint meetings.
1.
In Germany most bridges are procured as independent projects.
That makes it possible for small and medium-sized regional firms to take part in the tender.
In the Czech Republic many bridges are procured as part of a contract for a part of motorway route that is several kilometres long.
Small and medium-sized firms do not take part in this kind of tender, as the job is too big for them.
2.
There is greater variety in bridge structures used in the Czech Republic than in Germany.
In this context the NKÚ found that the type of bridge structure is decided long before it is built.
The decision is made during the time when the RMD submits the zoning decision application.
At this time the RMD selects bridge types from several alternatives, but economy plays only a minor role in decision-making.
A general conclusion regarding bridge prices in the Czech Republic and Germany would only be possible on the basis of a thorough analysis of the building work market in both countries; that would have been beyond the scope of this audit, however.
The border bridge is the most expensive composite steel-concrete bridge on the D 8 and A 17.
In the case of tunnels it was found that tunnels on the D 8 cost twice as much as tunnels in Germany.
Yet a comparison of the principal technical construction parameters of tunnels on the D 8 and tunnels in Germany revealed no fundamental difference.
The considerable price differences could be attributed to the fact that in the Czech Republic, there is no real competition in the tunnel building sector.
Nevertheless, the low number of tunnels made it impossible to reach generally applicable conclusions.
Effectiveness and efficiency of the motorway Dresden – Prague
The independent Czech Republic was established in 1993.
In the same year, the government approved the concept of motorway network development.
The D 8 was to be extended step by step from Prague towards the state frontier to Germany.
Section No. 0805 through the Central Bohemian Highlands was to be built before the border section No. 0807.
The Czech Republic is building the D 8 under programme financing.
Two objectives of the construction of the D 8 are defined in programme No. 327 220 “Construction of the D 8 Motorway, Prague – Usti nad Labem – Czech/ German State Frontier”:
1.
improve the connection between Prague and Usti nad Labem – national objective;
2.
improve the connection between Prague and Berlin as part of the Berlin-Istanbul Pan-European Transport Corridor IV – international objective.
According to the programme, construction of the section leading through the Central Bohemian Highlands was scheduled for completion in June 2008 and construction of the border section No. 0807 for June 2007.
It should be noted that the deadline for completing the construction is not identical with the deadline for putting into operation.
The NKÚ ascertained that the preparatory work for the construction of the section leading through the Central Bohemian Highlands is currently in the official zoning decision stage.
Ecological activists have contested this decision with legal actions.
A definitive ruling on the actions is pending.
It therefore cannot be ruled out that the section leading through the Central Bohemian Highlands will be completed several years later than stated in the programme documentation.
During summer 2006 the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed postponing the term of completing of section No. 0805 up to year 2010.
As a result of these circumstances, construction of the border section did not achieve the national goal of improving the connection between Prague and Usti nad Labem.
The RMD performed a capital expenditure appraisal of the border section of the D 8 No. 0807 and of section No. 0805 via the Central Bohemian Highlands in the years 1999 – 2001.
The investment cost included in this capital expenditure appraisal amounts to some € 639 million together for both sections No. 0805 and No. 0807.
Table 2: Results of the economic assessment (EIRR=economic internal return rate)
All planned motorways and highspeed roads open, both sections of the D 8 open in 2007.
Traffic volume on the northern part of the border section of 18 000 vehicles per day in 2010.
All planned motorways and highspeed roads open, both sections of the D 8 open in 2007.
Traffic volume on the northern part of the border section of 22.000 vehicles per day in 2010.
All planned motorways and highspeed roads open, both sections of the D 8 open in 2007.
Traffic volume on the northern part of the border section of 25 000 vehicles per day in 2010.
The economic analysis performed in 2001 relied on the assumption that the section near the frontier and the Central Bohemian Highlands section would both be finished at the time.
At the time of audit it is clear that the Central Bohemian Highlands section will not be opened by the original deadline.
That will reduce the aforementioned EIRR values.
The ex VAT costs of both sections specified as of 31.12.2005 were € 897 million, i.e. 27.4% higher than the cost level applied in the economic analysis in 2001.
There is a risk, however, that section No. 0805 will follow a different, more expensive route, which would impact on the aforementioned economic viability level.
As a result of the economic analysis, the construction of both motorway sections is economically viable at a traffic volume of at least 18 000 vehicles per day in 2010.
The forecast for 2008 indicated 22 940 vehicles per day but a study addressing the issue of detour routes in place of the missing section through the Central Bohemian Highlands reckons with a traffic volume in year 2007 of 12 600 to 13 750 vehicles per day, which puts the investment below the economic viability threshold.
A higher traffic load on the detour routes in place of the lacking Central Bohemian Highlands section gives rise to a high probability of congestion and thus also increased external costs that were not taken into account during the original economic analysis.
The aforementioned reduction in revenues and increase in costs means that the already low EIRR the construction of the D 8 border section was supposed to have will not be attained.
Proto je stavba příhraničního úseku D 8 neefektivní.
When building the A 17 motorway, cost overruns also occurred similarly to those of the two above sections of the D 8.
As part of the overall economic assessment for the 1992 federal long distance road plan, the German Federal Ministry for Transport assumed a cost of some € 320 million.
The resulting cost benefit ratio was 4.6.
In the meantime, costs have soared to some € 670 million reducing the cost benefit ratio by more than half.
Apart from the parallel audit work undertaken conjunctively with the NKÚ the BRH had audited the planning and construction of motorway A 17 in the years 2003 and 2005.
When doing so the BRH found that the relevant authorising states body demanded a landscape tunnel for the third section of the A 17 that was not needed.
During the course of audit work, the BRH succeeded in convincing the Federal Ministry and the German road works administration that the tunnel was not necessary.
As a result savings were made that accounted for single building cost of some € 10 million and € 0.15 million of annual operating costs.
When examining the first section of the A 17 the BRH found that the building project had not been adequately prepared.
This is illustrated by the following example:
At the planning stage, the road works administration failed to do a survey on the condition of the bedrock at the Dölzschen rock, since it was not easily accessible.
Only after the tunnel driving machine reached the rock they made up for it.
The tests showed that the interior rock was weathered to a higher extent than expected at the time of tendering.
This resulted in costly measures such as anchoring, injections and protection nets against rockfall that amounted to some € 3.3 million.
The road work administration had to bear the costs not only for additional extra operations such as the safety measures at the Dölzschen rock but also measures that would not have been needed if the building project had been adequately prepared in the first place.
Such expenditures include cost for disrupted building operations (€ 3.2 million), additional training for drilling staff (€ 0.5 million) and soaring wages and expenses on goods as a result of time overruns for the project (€ 7 million).
Thus excess costs amounted to some € 10.7 million that were not matched by any additional value.
On the basis of the lessons learnt from this project and other projects audited the BRH demanded the Federal Ministry to take more rigorous leadership regarding its oversight over road works.
In this context, the Federal Ministry should provide the necessary momentum for road works administrations to introduce quality assurance systems.
Benefits of cooperation for the BRH and the NKÚ The cooperation achieved the objectives of both audit institutions.
The BRH now has audit findings on the preparation, contract public procurement procedure and course of the construction of the border bridge.
The two supreme audit institutions developed a database of the prices of bridges and tunnels that can be relied on in future audits.
The NKÚ found that the main technical construction parameters of bridges, tunnels and the route of the D 8 motorway are no different from the A 17 parameters.
Auditors of both institutions taking part in the cooperation gained new experiences that can be put to use in future audits.

Brett Kavanaugh: High-speed FBI investigation
Time is extremely tight and the number of planned interrogations is very restricted.
Republicans in the US Senate want the break-neck speed FBI investigation to help secure a majority for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which has become paper thin amid allegations of sexual misconduct.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline of Friday for investigators to clarify more than 30 years of suspected incidents from years back.
The recent turnaround in the drama surrounding Kavanaugh's nomination, which has involved a culture war, had been triggered on Friday.
After an 8-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first accuser Christine Blasey Ford, in which the lawyer directed angry tirades at the opposition democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee wanted to pave the way for final confirmation of the ultra-sensitive judge at the US Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when Senator Jeff Flake, against his original announcement, suddenly declared he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
Following tumultuous scenes his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who described the bitter arguments on Thursday as a ‘scam’, then included further attacks against the women and spoke in contrast about a ‘blessing in disguise’.
He said that this way any lingering doubts could be eliminated.
Later, Trump attacked Democrats sharply at a rally because they opposed Kavanaugh: "They try to block and destroy."
Trump is ordering an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh case
The White House has also severely narrowed the powers of the investigators.
They will focus on investigating the known allegations by two women, nothing more, a government official told the Wall Street Journal: "They will not be going on a fishing trip."
According to the ‘New York Times’ only four witnesses will be heard.

FC Schalke 04 after defeating Mainz: You could feel the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first win of the season against Mainz.
There is a great sense of relief at Schalke after the first win of the season.
Nevertheless, time was also a factor against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - By now, Christian Heidel is well-known for being a huge pessimist at football matches.
The home game against Mainz 05 was no different.
I saw every ball going in.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty area, said the sports director of Schalke 04 - and breathed a sigh of relief.
After all, the "royal blues" had managed to seal the narrow 1:0 win against Mainz over the course of the match and thus celebrated the first victory of the season.
In fact, things could have been very different.
After Alessandro Schöpf (11th) had given the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco the lead and therefore security, Tedesco said: "In sum, the first half was good, both in terms of how we played and in terms of pressing". As the match continued, mental strength became increasingly important.
Schöpf is usually not an aerial threat
The last ten minutes felt like two hours to me, said Heidel: ‘I can understand if the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench’.
The boys were afraid to squander the lead and therefore kept retreating.
And threw everything they had into our defense.
To hold on to the first three points of the season.
We all felt a huge weight lifted off our shoulders, said Schöpf, whose scoring header played no insignificant part: "And I am actually the worst header on the team."
But in the end, victory is all that counts.
The relief was felt throughout the entire arena, not least by Tedesco.
We wanted to start strong in the early stages and make a firework of it, said Schalke’s head coach.
The win was an important one.
Finally we can enjoy ourselves for a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played smart, calmly and with courage, that is how we must approach matches over 90 minutes
The biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: The "Royal Blues" missed their chance to establish control over the match early.
After all, they did get their chances, for example via the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who hit the crossbar twice (59th/72nd) or Amine Harit (62nd).
That way it would not have been such a nerve wrecking victory, said Tedesco: "You really could feel the fear a little bit."
So I am glad that we won.
He was not the only one at Schalke.

Fischbachau: Smoke column in the Leitzachtal visible from 2 km
The smoke was hard to miss.
On Sunday at around 13.30, at a distance of approximately two kilometres a hiker in the Leitzachtal observed a fire.
The police are now investigating.
Fischbachau - The cause was soon discovered by the police and fire departments: A stranger had set fire to garbage on a two square meter area at Gschwendner Berg.
According to the police, it appears the fire was monitored for a long time, but the embers were inadvertently left behind.
Close to the forest too.
30 Fischbachau firefighters were tasked with dispersing and extinguishing it.
The police now think it is a case of arson.

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
Professor Doctor Aladin El-Mafaalani is standing before them.
He has once again accepted the invitation from Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
For many year, I have made it my mission to bring interesting people to Greven, explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates in organizing the evening with the "Kulturpolitik" alliance.
El-Mafaalani casually starts the reading, describing the writing process of the book, talking about how difficult it was to explain the topic comprehensibly.
With a lot of gestures, tangible numbers and a joke or two, he introduces the audience to one of the most contentious topics: Migration and integration.
Why are there increasingly conflicts, despite successful integration?
The Syrian-born author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
The German society sits at the big table, the migrants of the first generation at the kid’s table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to sit at the table.
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany. They always sat at the big table and now want to have a say too.
This leads to conflicts.
Therefore, it is not of importance whether one is politically right or left, but: "Am I for or against an open society?" he emphasizes.
At first rather restrained, then the discussion round gets more and more lively.
And there is a need for discussion.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, and two teachers explain how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stands in front of the stage, not on it, symbolizing the discussion: It is a discussion at eye level.
The sociology professor does not force his opinion onto the audience, emphasizing that he speaks of the average, not of individual destinies.
He is happy that people are interested in the topic, because “we can only find a solution once we understand what the problem is,” says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the subsequent signing session, he still has an open ear for the guests’ questions and the discussion continued in the foyer over Kurdish specialties.

Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 properties
The demand is obviously huge: Over 100 interested parties have applied to buy one of the properties in South Landsham.
The Pliening community sold the first properties in the South Landsham development area on the open market.
This was reported by the mayor Roland Frick.
Anyway the application phase for each of the 20 properties, which the municipality is offering at better conditions and prices - similar to the earlier local model, has now ended.
At least 100 applications have been received, says Frick.
At present, the documents are being reviewed with regard to the application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the Mayor of Pliening, the goal by the end of the year is to have the candidate ranking list for the 20 plots of land ready for submission to the local council.
After that the awarding of the plots can follow.
In the area to the south of Landsham a total of 50 single-family and semi-detached properties will be created, including four areas for apartment blocks earmarked for eight residential units.
The development is practically completed, only the streets and pathways now need to be asphalted.
A single plot and two for apartment buildings belong to a private individual, the rest to the municipality of Pliening.
The municipality sells the bulk of the plots on the open market, 20 plots according to the socially responsible model.
The two multi-family houses of the borough are to be built according to Frick as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented flats subsidised by the Free State.
Room for 200 people
Roughly estimated, there will be space for about 200 people within the properties of the developing area of Landsham-Süd.
Not only this: At the start of October, Frick says the new construction of a daycare center will begin.
This will accommodate three kindergarten and three toddler groups, including a multipurpose room.
The opening is planned for September 2019, the start of the next kindergarten year.

This way, Schalke player Naldo is also a great athlete on the bench
Not in the starting lineup for the third time in a row: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues has not been in the Schalke starting line-up for the third time in a row, many people would have understood it if the almost two-meters-tall Brazilian player had got his frustration off his chest.
But when the Schalke players gathered after the 1-0 win over FSV Mainz 05 in the center circle as usual and head coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his players, the 36-year-old nicknamed Naldo stepped in and said; "We have to thank, coach!"
That was very emotional, he is such a great sport, Tedesco said later about the reaction of his vice-captain, who holds no grudge despite his seat on the bench.
Naldo, who was awarded best Schalke player last season, probably knows that he is actually not going to be stuck on the bench - he does have a good reason for this break.
A reason called “load control.”
It was not easy to tell him
It was not easy to tell him that, I tell you, Tedesco said when he told Naldo that he was not in the starting lineup.
He is an important player. He is an important person.
But it’s always about the thing, it’s about the club,” said Tedesco as he justifies the step.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can catch their breath at the moment.
And that we keep everyone together, said Tedesco explaining the rotation, which has recently hit Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian reacted wisely: by proving himself as a model team player on the bench.

Compared to the rest of the euro zone, the descending mood in Austria's industry continued to accelerate further in August.
The purchasing managers index (PMI) was at a 37-month low at 46.7 points.
Across Europe, however, Austria still has the third-best mood in Europe after Ireland and the Netherlands, stated the Markit Institute on Monday about its survey of 3,000 companies.
In contrast to Austria, the euro zone PMI rose by 1.1 points to 45.1 points, putting the index below the growth indicating 50-counter mark for the 13th month in a row.
Only Ireland's industry cracked this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
Bottom were the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer did fall, but it fell more slowly than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached 44.0 points, its highest level since March.
However, the slightly eased downswing could mean that the worst is over, said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, the industry - at least in the third quarter - remains the number one growth brake.
A quick return to the growth zone is not in sight: Export orders to the eurozone have not fallen this much since November 2011.
That is why companies have cut back jobs for the seventh month in a row.
Industrial production in China in August fell more strongly than initially assumed.
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The PMI figures are based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, the developments in terms of turnover, employment, warehousing and prices are recorded.
