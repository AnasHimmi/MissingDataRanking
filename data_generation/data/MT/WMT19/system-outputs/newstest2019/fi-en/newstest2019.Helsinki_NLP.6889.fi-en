Eemeli Kouki led the Hurricanes to a home win in the opening - another win for Savo Volley
No fewer than seven times in a row for the men's volleyball championship medals, Hurrikaani-Loima started the 2018-19 season with a home win when Raision Loimu fell 3-0 on Saturday.
Eemeli Kouki, the overall player who returned from Romania to Finland, was the most effective in the Hurricanes by 22 points.
There were some tunes overseas, but they did not happen, and then a call came from Loima.
Pretty quickly, the homes were agreed, Kouki said.
Tomi Rumpune, who has played like Kouk in Loimus, backed Kouk by 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was the team logging Sam Kaislasalo, who is playing on a match-by-match contract, by 17 points.
Winning the opening game is always important.
Many players had experience with the opposite side, and it brought extra extras to the game.
Our game is not ready yet, but continuing the medal pipeline is obviously a goal, Kouki said.
Määttänen Savo Volley's most effective
Miro Määttänen was the most effective at Savo Volley by 18 points, when the team toppled Vieralla by 3-0.
Our game was erratic, especially on the offensive end, but thankfully we got squeezed out.
At least I did not have any conscious different downloads when I was playing against my former team, "Määttänen said.
During the 2000-01 season, he started his career with a 3-pointer in Vierema's third-round series and finished with 12 points.
The head coach, Mr Tuovinen, welcomed several things.
The hall was small, that is, the atmosphere on the roof all the time.
A good feeling remained from the home opening.
Miro was fit, Sillikin played a good game, Tuovinen said.
Siltala's previous season in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver in Pielaveden Sammo when Tuovinen was head coach even then.
Thiago Maciel was the Ducks' most effective with 14 points.
Mikkonen again Akaa-Volley star
Joni Mikkonen, who won the league's top scorer in 2012-13, has also started this season strongly.
The logger scored 25 points as Akaa-Volley took his opening win of the season after falling to the Tigers 3-2.
The season has started quite well in its own right.
It was a close defeat today, because we were 17-21 in the fourth round.
We dug in somewhere, and the fifth round came at the same time, "Mikkonen said.
The most effective of the Tigers, who were still in the final a few seasons ago, was the logging Edvarts Buivids, who scored 28 points.
Compatriot Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs backed by 17 points.
There was almost no grip on the guy's logging, Mikkonen boasted.
"Don't worry boy, this is not an execution, it is a lesson.
Finland ranks number one in the world in comparison with human capital
Finland is at the forefront of the world in comparing human capital, according to the scientific journal Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
During the years, 1950s were compared.
In both years Finland was number one in the statistics.
In 2016, the top five were almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Finland was behind Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, the Netherlands ranked one higher, and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found on the list.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan were ranked the worst in the rankings.
When measuring human capital, the level of education, access to education, skills and health is considered.
The World Bank has signalled that human capital is linked to economic growth.

Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico in check, local game finished unscored
Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was stretched to glory disposals and the local game of the Macedonian teams ended in a goalless draw late on Saturday in the Spanish Football League.
Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa, from Atletico Madrid, were the closest goals, but Belgian guard Courtois had to fight back.

Abortion rights are now being attacked in the US - a powerful documentary says why
The US Senate is currently trying to determine whether one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could choose Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee set by President Donald Trump.
In the Republican Party, many hope that Kavanaugh's crucial voice will overturn a decision known as Roe against Wade that made abortion legal in the USA in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg documentary Reversing Roe - The United States and abortion rights show how the current situation has become over the years.
As incredible as it seems, the subject is also relevant in Finland.
The foreign minister, Mr Soini (sin), has done publicity work against safe abortion and has received varying degrees of support from MPs in our country in terms of power.
At the beginning of the powerful documentary, the gynaecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has remained the only doctor to perform abortions in the state of Missouri due to the tightening of the laws.
An armed guard at the clinic says he is defending America's religious freedom.
News videos are a reminder of the deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
Let's move to a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At the time, a consortium of Lutheran churchgoers advised women to have reliable abortion doctors.
The reasoning behind the interviewed pastor is good, but in fact it is not even necessary, a photograph of a woman who died of an abortion herself is enough.
The number of deaths in the USA was approximately 5000 a year.
The legalization of abortions was defended, especially by the Republican Party.
Back in 1967, in California, the Abortion Rights Act was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, it was Reagan, in his presidential campaign in 1980, who began transformatively confusing religion with politics to garner voters.
His abortion position was also favored by his successor George Bush.
And Donald Trump did the same.
At the deepest heart of the matter, the documentary reaches the bottom of its search for the politicisation of the abortion issue.
When pro-apartheid religious organizations were denied tax exemption, they became politically active.
Abortion was chosen as a stick horse.
Religion has brought extraordinary knots to politics.
In writing this, the USA is facing a situation in which Kavanaugh, now accused of sexually harassing several women of sexual harassment, has been chosen by the president, who has been grabbing the votes of the religious right on his abortion file.
Kavanaugh can have the power to decide the rights of 164 million American women and girls based on scales.

Israeli military shooting at seven Palestinians, including two children - major protests at border
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months as Israel has shelled protesters in the border zone.
On Friday, Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza border zone, the Palestinian Ministry of Health says.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, two children are among the dead: boys aged 12 and 14.
The ministry says 505 people have been wounded.
Of these, 89 were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli military has confirmed that it opened fire and carried out an airstrike on the border zone as protesters threw rocks and explosives at Israeli troops.
The military says it has started using force so that the protesters do not break up the border fence or seek it on the other side.
At least 191 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza protests since March, when Palestinians launched weekly protests at the border.
The number of wounded is 12,000, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights.
The protesters demanded access for Palestinian families to the areas from which the Palestinians were forced to leave when the state of Israel was established in 1948.
One Israeli soldier has been killed by a Palestinian sniper.
The explosive devices, which have been dropped on the Palestinian side with kits and helium balls, have ignited forest areas and farmland in Israel.

Paedophile assistance service was immediately filled with bookings - approximately 40,000 in Finland experience an interest in children
According to the estimate, two per cent of men and a small percentage of women experience at least some sexual interest in pre-teenagers.
In Finland, this amounts to approximately 40,000 persons.
Until now, it has been difficult for those who are sexually interested in children or young people to get help.
A joint Serie project between the Criminal Care Supervisory and Sexpo will train professionals to confront paedophiles as customers, as well as help people who experience sexual interest in children.

However, these are promised to be released during the autumn.
Sexual preference against children is a source of shame for many.

Korean leaders or Congolese gynaecologists?
Us President Donald Trump as the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize - the idea might sound strange, but Trump is one of the biggest favourites for the award, based on betting odds.
The backdrop is Trump's role in getting North Korea, at least at the level of speeches, to commit to nuclear disarmament.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who have already met three times this year and pledged to seek a peace treaty between their two countries, are among the biggest favourites for peace.
The warming of relations between the Koreas is considerable, as last year's relations were still good.
Nevertheless, the reward of Kim, who has been swimming with nuclear weapons for years and is leading his country with an iron grip, would undoubtedly stir criticism as well.
The Nobel Prize recipients will be announced as of Monday, and the most attentive, the Peace Prize, will be on Friday.
If the prize is not given to those involved in the diplomacy of the Korean peninsula, Denis Mukwege, a Congolese doctor, is one of the top candidates.
The prestigious gynaecologist has treated thousands of women who have been victims of gang rape at his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo and emerged as a leading expert in the world.
With his work, Mukwege has drawn attention to sexual violence, a spooky byproduct of many conflicts.
The United Nations Refugee Organization, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been considered a strong candidate.
The Nobel committee has reported that 331 candidates will be eligible for the award this year.
The names of the candidates will not be made public.
Trump himself would not mind if he got the Nobel.
In May, a reporter asked him at the White House if he thought he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks that, but I would never say it, "Trump said, smiling.
I want to get this ready.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, "the president continued, referring to the North Korea talks.
But there are elements that make Trump's Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides the award, has often paid tribute to individuals and organizations representing liberal democracy and the multipolar world order - precisely the kind of international cooperation that Trump has seen as an opponent.
In the 21st century, three US politicians have won the award, all of whom have been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, and Barack Obama in 2009.
So rewarding Trump would require an ideological U-turn from the Nobel committee.

Fire notice in the tunnel: motorists behaved like harmonies and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos that occurred on the number one test in Lohja took place on 8 September.
As a result of the announcement, traffic in the tunnel area was cut off in the direction of both Tampere and Helsinki.
When it became clear that this was a systemic fault, the fire service sought to make traffic normal.
But it did not work out very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Telecommunications Centre said it could not be opened because there are motorists on the road, too, and they are driving how it hurts, "Pasi Kääriainen, a firefighter, told STT at the time.
At the time, the highway was even driven in the wrong direction after just a moment of waiting.
When the first begins to act against the rules of the road, a few others often follow suit, Tapio Heiskanen, head of transport security contact, is surprised.
According to the traffic rules, motorways and tunnels must not stop for more than a compelling reason.
Transport security reminds that, in exceptional circumstances, you cannot go out of your way to compromise traffic with hasty solutions.
Alarm vehicles must always be given as unfettered a pass as possible.
Driving in the opposite direction on the highway is particularly prohibited, as is the conclusion and cancellation of the U-turn.
The same bans also apply in tunnels, where the headlights must always be switched on.
Stopping without a compelling cause is also prohibited, as is, of course, parking.
There have even been instances recently where the driver has stopped in the tunnel to brush the snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this activity, "Heiskanen says in a statement released by Transportation Security.
He is in town for a couple of weeks, the perfect opposite of your brother.
He was caught by a group of our parents... when he got released.

Ilves fans would have liked to have continued their celebrations even though the ship was caught in the lake bottom
Ilves fans carried by inland water ship M / S Tampere would have preferred to stay on the ship to continue their celebrations, even though the ship had been caught in the lake bottom of its ring, according to Juho Syrjä, the ship's chief operating officer at the time of the incident.
Late on Saturday evening, M / S Tampere, which has been travelling from Helsinki, fell out of its route and was caught at the bottom of its bottom in Vanajawater, Akaa.
The 19 passengers and five crew members on board the ship were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one was hurt in the wreckage.
Ilves fans would have liked to have continued to celebrate on the ship until the morning, but of course it made more sense to send them on the board of the fire service to port and bus home, Syrjä told STT.
Ilves fans had been on the court to watch the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended in a 4-3 win over Ilves.
According to Syrjä, Saturday's smell was due to the fact that the water surface in Vanajawater was approximately half a metre below normal.
The navigation was also hampered, according to Syrjä, by the fact that the nearest gateway sign was covered by login waste, which meant that its reflectors were not normally visible in the dark evening of September.
No more mentionable collision
Haveri happened on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalme shortly after the ship route had undercut the motorway bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
The greater drama surrounding the incident was not related, according to Syrjä, as the pace of the vessel was very low at the time of the incident and the hit to the bottom caused no more collision.
According to Syrjä, catching the bottom has not caused any leaks or pressures on the ship, and with these prospects the ship's cruises will continue as normal.
The diver went to check the condition of the ship on Saturday morning before the ship started to be towed away from the shallows.
As a precaution, we are still in the shipyard to check that there was no damage, Syrjä says.
Syrjä believes that M / S Tampere's next cruise, booted for next weekend, can be handled as agreed.

Trump judge nominee accused of harassment and plotting may miss out on top office
Brett Kavanaugh, a U.S. Supreme Court judge, may well miss the post he is seeking, according to a statement from the Institute of Foreign Policy.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate conduct during his time studying.
The doubts have brought so much political pressure to the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up presenting someone else to the office, according to Mr. Miliband.
It has occasionally occurred in the United States that the president's nominee to be a Supreme Court judge has generated plenty of controversy.
In that case, the judge candidate has usually withdrawn himself, according to the statement.
In doing so, the president has been able to maintain his face.
The appointment would go to the Democrats' Laar
The US Supreme Court is trying to be above politics, but in Kavanaugh's case at least, the election of a new judge has become a politically sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision will likely rain on the Democratic Party's legislature in the upcoming midterm congressional elections, according to Kavanaugh.
That would stir up turnout among young people and women who are more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, a conservative judge's nomination to the Supreme Court would be a longstanding victory for Republicans.
Every presidential term will not be an opportunity, as in the United States Supreme Court judges will be appointed for a lifetime.
In practice, some of them have opted out of retirement at approximately 70 to 80 years of age.
Republican front-runner hesitates to nominate
Judge nominees for the Supreme Court of the United States will also be subpoenaed by the norm, he said.
Even though Trump has imposed a deadline of just one week for the FBI's additional investigation, he can still point to something substantive, according to his account.
Yes, it might bring.
There is rarely any smoke without fire, says Mecca.
At least it is certain that Kavanaugh's appropriateness or inappropriateness to the post will still be vigorously discussed before the Senate makes its decision, according to the statement.
Republicans have a majority of 51 to 49 votes in the Senate, but at least two female Republican senators are thought to be skeptical of Kavanaugh's nomination.
The most embarrassing thing would be for the nomination to be put to the vote and Republicans to lose.

Woman identified as Salisbury suspect's military intelligence agent
A Russian woman has told broadcaster the BBC that she identifies a Russian man suspected of poisoning Salisbury as an agent of Russia's military intelligence service.
The woman said the photos show that Anatoly Tshepiga, who works in the GRU, is a military intelligence officer.
The online community Bellingcat and Russian community Insider Russia said they had previously revealed one of the men suspected of the poisoning as Czech.
Earlier, they said they had found evidence that the current identities of the men were undercover identities.
The BBC group travelled to the village near the border between Russia and China, where Tshepiga grew up.
The woman, who lives in the village, identified the photos released by the young Tshepigan Bellingcat.
He identified the same man from the images of British police who appeared to call Ruslan Boshirov himself today.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Novitshok in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been awarded the honour of the Russian hero in 2014, for example.
Russia still denies the alleged GRU link.
Earlier in September, the men suspected of poisoning told Russian TV that they had been tourists in Salisbury.

Seniors throw bags at war reform
Now there is a vivid example of what the Sipilä government's defined restrictions on war reform mean in practice.
The Sote services of my birthplace, Helsinki, will be produced by the municipal consortium of the Arch, the former regional director of Attendo, who was elected director of the health service in 2016.
The leaders of the consortium warn the council against a restriction on change.
If war spending increases now, the municipal government grants will be cut in the future.
The county's central policymakers were startled, and most of them are ready for a major restructuring of the care of the elderly, which would put an end to the facility management of the health department bed and a small unit of the memory diseases.
Home hospital treatment would be increased, meaning that elderly people living in remote villages would be punched next to a health centre to be treated "at home."
Attendo relied on the municipality to pay customers for it.
The Left did not swallow the bad preparation, but organized a good audience event with lots of relatives, middle managers and delegates from other parties.
I presented the preparation of the sote province with digs on how, at the moment, the elderly are being treated most at home throughout the North.
Carina West, a delegate from the neighbouring council, was also involved.
The local newspaper made a big story about the occasion, and it brought the draftsmen on the back foot.
The draftsmen do not write in any papers that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Helsinki that is now waiting for empty residents.
There are no other service producers.
The draftsmen only talk about the voucher, but do not say what level of treatment they will receive or what kind of personnel structure Attendo will treat the elderly until the palliative treatment.
Without a nurse?
In fact, the facilities of the health centre will be stopped because there is no doctor's call at night.
Attendo will also be resorting to doctors at the Centre for Health in Helsinki.
The example of Helsinki reflects how centrist officials run delegates with inadequate knowledge and the delegates put their backs against the wall with a restriction on change.
In doing so, the Centre Party will empty the inhabitants of Helsinki, who will remain unsafe to live there voluntarily if there is an opportunity to move out.
Was it one election slogan of the centre to keep the whole country inhabited?

Turkish President Erdogan opened a major mosque in Cologne
In the German city of Cologne, thousands of people protested when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is visiting the country, opened a mosque of Europe's largest.
Several hundred people had gathered on the Rhine River from early morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read in the signs of the protesters, and the slogans condemned fascism.
Several protests have taken place during Erdogan's visit on Thursday, and security measures have been rigorous.
In Cologne, approximately 10,000 people were expected to protest in advance, including the human rights situation in Turkey.
Supporters of Erdogan had also gathered at a large mosque nearby.
However, police had cordoned off a large area of the mosque for security reasons.
In his inaugural address, Erdogan praised the success of his visit to Germany and said it had strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel vowed on Friday to rebuild relations between the two countries, which have deteriorated significantly since Turkey's 2016 coup attempt.
However, Merkel stressed that there were deep differences between the two countries over issues such as human rights.
Criticism surrounds the visit
Both Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker and North Rhine-Westphalia Prime Minister Armin Laschet cancelled their participation in the opening ceremony as criticism of Erdogan's visit intensified.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, said he came to the anti-Erdogan demonstration from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who cannot take to the streets in Turkey.
They have been arrested, killed and subjected.
For Erdogan, everything that is different from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the final stage of Erdogan's trip to Germany, in North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant proportion of the population is of Turkish origin.

Three charges of murdering a journalist in Slovakia
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
On Friday, the prosecutor said three people were charged with the February murder of Kuciak and his engagement, as well as other crimes.
Earlier this week, police arrested eight people in an investigation into the murder, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot in February with his engagement at his home in Bratislava.
He had studied the links between politicians and the Italian mafia.
Police have suspected the murders are related to Kuciak's reports.
The case and Kuciak's published article have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.

Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Today, the journalist Arto Nyberg will be interviewed live on his forthcoming talk show, for example Vesa Heilala.
Vesa is in the studio to report on her upcoming space trip, which she booked from Virgin Galactica back in 2010.
The cost was EUR 151,000, which was required to pay the bank loan.
If the original plans were true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the date of the day has been postponed year on year.
Now it seems that after an unfortunate test flight that occurred in 2014 and caused a fatality, things are fair.
If all goes well, commercial flights will start again during this year or next year at the latest.
Vesa's flight number is 300, meaning his journey is approximately one year away from the first departure.
The flight will last 2.5 hours and the weightless space will be 5 minutes above 100 km, the Finnish astronaut says on his upcoming website.
At the same address, he also backfires on his yearning for space.

Manchester City were rude hosts
Manchester City continued their undefeated run in the Premier League when they scored 2-0 at home to Brighton on Saturday.
Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero are the guarantors of the reigning champion team's sixth win of the season.
Sterling was allowed to steer his fourth of the season from close range to an empty goal when Leroy Sané found him in the 30th minute with Brighton's goal backhand.
Agüero raised his own mark to five when he saddled Sterling with the Brighton defense for pieces in the 65th game.
The Argentine was able to locate the 2-0 final points from the penalty spot easily.

Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Raikkonen and surprised Ferrari to "lose a very important driver"
In an interview with Swiss newspaper Blick, Mersun's British driver was asked if he believed Kimi Raikkonen's release from Ferrari's service would help Hamilton in the final season.

AFC's championship championship fight became a complete farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players
The top tier of football boys will end on Saturday, when the final round of the season will be played.
Before the round started at 13, the starting points were clear in terms of the championship battle: FC Bay Academy is enough of a top spot in practice against Vasa IFK.
In order to turn things around in the final round, Ilves, who are second in the championship battle, will have to win PK-35 and hope for defeat by the Chargers.
However, even before the starting whistle, the championship was confirmed in practice, as Vasa IFK had arrived in the bay with only seven players.
If there had been one fewer people, the match could not have started.
FC Bay Academy won the match 16-0.
At the break, the Chargers led 7-0.

Serena Williams is starring in a video of herself singing topless - campaigning for awareness of breast cancer
Tennis superstar Serena Williams shrugs again.
He is now campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by releasing a video on his Instagram account of him singing purely hands in front of his breasts, the AFP news agency reported.
The piece is the 1991 hit I Touch Myself of Australian The Divinyls.
In the video, Williams supports the Australian Breast Cancer Society.
"I pronounced The Divinyls a global hit to remind women to regularly conduct spontaneous [breast] checks," Williams writes in an Instagram post.
And yes, this put me in a discomfort zone, but I wanted to do it because it affects all women, regardless of their skin color, all over the world.
Early detection is everything a and o - it is playing into the lives of many.
The second author of "The Divinyls" is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which has been made in honour of Chrissy Amphlett.
"She passed away from breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first," Williams said.
The video has now been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was published early Sunday morning.
In comments on the video, Williams is praised for being brave.
Williams opted out of the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
The backdrop is the excitement at the US Open three weeks ago.
Williams came to the main judge of the match and argued, among other things, that men are accepted for much more drastic behaviour than female players.

Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
Whether or not many lotteries stay at home.
However, it is worth thinking about whether others should be infected, as the disease can be contagious even if their own symptoms are small.
In between, the symptoms of the flu suddenly strike, sometimes they turn up in creeps.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your own symptoms seem small, according to the Prevent publication.
So is it worth staying home?
According to Prevention, the flu is contagious even when the person himself has no symptoms.
The virus will be transmitted a day before the symptoms start and from then on from five days to a week.
Children may be infecting the disease longer.
As soon as you recognise the symptoms, you shouldn't be in school or at work.
You can go back to work when the cough is relentless and there is no more fever, says Gregory Poland, professor of medicine.

New Miss Finland repeats the mission tradition: "my husband is a jockey"
The jockey and the missus are often linked.
This was also the case for Alina Voronkova, 23.
Alina Voronkova, from Pertunmaa, has received the 2018 Miss Finnish crown on her chin.
The beauty now lives in the bay, where she moved to when she was 15.
Alina's mother is an inker Finnish and a father a Russian.
Voronkova, a father from Russia, was bullied at school.
My mum and Father have moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied because of my Russianism.
In Pertunmaa, I had no friends at all, "Alina says during the announcement of the semi-finalists at the Miss Suomi Games.
After secondary school, Alina decided to start afresh and move to the bay to go to high school.
Soon, the missus beauty found new friends, and the everyday person went on to roll hopefully.
At the age of 15, I imagine being an adult, but when I thought about it afterwards, I really was not.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Mr Hurr, who is familiar with the Pelicans' ranks.
After a career in the Championship, the jockey has played abroad, including Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was in Finland's squad for the 18-year-old World Championships.
During the early days of the courtship, the couple lived almost a year away, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I came to the winning trio and had a career with it, I do not want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we have to live separately, we have the confidence to do well, and in the distance it is a good thing that the initial spark remains over the period, "Alina tweeted in May.

Important point for IFK Mariehamn - Inter coach regretted the mistake
IFK Mariehamn's Simon Silverholt's equaliser against Inter brought an important point for the team in the men's football league on Saturday.

An important goal and a valuable point was summed up by Maarianhamina's head coach Peter Lundberg.

Lehterä showed his under-strength skills, the place to play is not sure yet
Jori Lehterä's strong under-strength play came to the fore when her NHL club, the Philadelphia Flyers, played its last practice match before the season began.
Philadelphia won 4-1, and Lehterä fed Michael Raffl twice to score.
Over the past few days, Lehter has been on display due to suspicions of drugs.
On Wednesday, MTV reported that Lehter is one of 23 suspected drug dealers where some are suspected of drug use and some of the sales, for example.
Lehterä has denied committing the crime.
The club and the player have discussed the subject, and the NHL is investigating the incident.
Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Sam Carchidi, who is closely watching the Flyers, estimated after the match that Lehter is part of a group of six strikers, five of whom will have a place in the NHL team.
In the rehearsal match, Lehter was excellent, according to Carchidi.
In the second set, Lehterä fought the puck for himself in an underwhelming manner, pulled the defender and fed Raffl, who was waiting in front of goal, into the open seat.
For the second time, the pair's collaboration brought the goal right at the end of the match.
The Flyers will start the NHL season on October 4 with a guest match against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defender Urho Vaakanainen is awaiting a resolution of the team's coaching leadership, whether he will join the NHL.

Eddie Hall, who was crowned the strongest man in the world in 2017, is undergoing a striking turnaround.
British Eddie Hall hunted for the title of the world's strongest man for a long and determined time.

The shirts were a size 5XL.
Hall admitted before winning the title that he was doing damage to his body.
The human body has not been created to be this size, Hall said.
The Briton hunted for the world's strongest man's win by all means and the family man promised to end his career if he got the title.
Hall did not want her children to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise and was no longer seen at the 2018 World's Strongest Man Championships in April.
Recently, Hall posted a photo on Instagram showing her considerably more active career in slim condition.
Hall writes his current weight is 169.5 kilograms.
Today, Hall wrote that she is playing aerobically five times a week.
The program includes things like boxing, cycling and swimming.
Moreover, Hall makes four tremors a week at the gym.

The inland water ship M / S Tampere ran aground late on Friday evening in Akaalla, St Lake.

Ex managers demand unpaid fees from Robert Helenius
Boxer Robert Helenius's evening match against Erkan Teper is overshadowed by money.
Today, Ilta-Sanomat reported on an application for a challenge submitted by boxing manager James Helminen and Deputy Judge, who will be charged a total of just over EUR 80,000 in unpaid manager fees.
According to the application for the challenge, Helminen and
We have tried to reconcile, but there is no other alternative.
'There has been a clear mandate and a great deal of work has been done,'says Mr Joukila to Ilta-Sanomat.
The current manager of Helenius, Mr Sundman, sent a note to this newspaper explaining what happened to the boxer's view.
Helenius denies being obliged to pay the amount required.
According to the correspondence, he and Helminen had offered their services in a financially fraught situation to Helenius and promised that they would be able to organise matches and sponsorships for him.
Verbally, it was agreed that Helenius was obliged to pay only percentages of premiums for his matches.
It was repeatedly assured that Helenius would have to pay nothing, only to receive the income they had organised.
This is also normal and the only practice in professional athletes' managerial activities.
The paid work has never been agreed, and it would also have been absurd in Helenius's situation, Sundman explains in a message.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
According to the equivalent, Helenius would have liked to have agreed to the distribution in writing from the outset, but the draft was not reached until the end of 2014.
He said the proposal was poor on its own behalf, and cut off the cooperation with ja Helminen.
Helenius never took any action when he was involved in the relationships between

A heartfelt man and a good journalist
Mr. Vainio, an entertainment artist and musical producer, knew the late radio presenter and journalist Mr. Päll for decades.
At the age of 83, the long-line radio presenter and journalist Mr Pälli died of incurable liver cancer.
The announcement of the presenter's death was published in Sunday's Helsinki Sanomat.
The notice says Päll died on September 3.
Pälli reported the serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen at the time by Ile Vainio, who was saddened by the destiny of the acquaintance.
She left Facebook earlier than her farewell, Ile Vainio says.
Mr. Vainio considers Mr. Päll to be a multi-jockey, who became a great journalist.
He remembers Päll as being a considered person with quick hoaxes and funny stuff.
I learned to know Erk as a little boy when I first went to Finnrecord at the age of 12 and started there as a stockbroker.
We got to know Erk then.
He was then a spokesman for Finn and in various positions, Ile Vainio remembers.
When I went on to make records as a musical producer, there were hundreds of occasions in which Mr. Pälli was a regular journalist at all parties doing stuff about artists.
He was always knowledgeable and I saw how big a fire he had for entertainment, music and people.
When he interviewed someone, he got straight to the skin of his interviewees.
He was a heartfelt man and a good journalist.
For many, he became familiar as a prestigious Yle radio presenter, but he also wrote brilliant press reports.
I was interviewed several times, too.
He was good at talking, Vainio boasts.
Over the decades, Pälli worked not only for the supplier, but also for the Fazer record company Hope.
He was a music producer on the records of Vesa-Matti Loir.
However, Päll's greatest passion was radio work, in which he had a distinctive style.
He has been doing radio work since the 1960s, and he became familiar to numerous listeners in Ylen's ether.
Pälli retired in 1998.

Rain sweeps over Finland at night
A long area of rain is spreading across the country on Sunday night from the direction of the West, the Bureau of Meteorology says.

We believed in Erika all the time, but half an hour before the result, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is Inker and Dimitri Russian.
Alina wears fluent Russian, even though she has lived throughout her childhood in Finland.
Svetlana says that Alina was a little more interested in the play and many other things than her miss career.
Alina was often told that when she was so visible she should start as a miss.
But he announced that he wanted to be a radio presenter.
Only later did Alina get excited about beauty contests.
The parents' wish was for Alina to go to university before participating in the Miss Finland competition.
That is what happened, and in the end Alina still wanted to do a stump before the miss games.
We already asked last year why he was not participating, but he wanted to complete it.
Parents believe that Alina won the contest because it is a healthy example for young people and adults.
He sports a lot and eats healthily.
And Alina likes to be on display, it shows.
Alina's boyfriend, Mr Hurri, is jockeying for his job in Japan, and was unable to encourage Finland to love him in the finals.
Alina's parents believe that the relationship between the young people will last a year.
Yes, that is the intention!
The parents hoped that their daughter would have time to visit soon.
There has been such a long pause in visits due to the missives.
It is already unfortunate, even though messages have been sent.

Sari Piippo left his career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - reminiscent of the idea of a comic book: the lack of drawing skills did not slow down
At one time, Luomuhöppä went from my husband's utterance to suggesting it as a person to a story I was developing, according to Sari Piippo, a subpoena comic blogger, housewife and former EU translator.
Sari Piippo says she was in Brussels for the EU's economic and legal affairs until after the fourth child, the family became a returner ten years ago.
I have been very comfortable as a housewife.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it came to mind that what it would be like when the smallest child started to be big.
Then, in 2014, a comic came into the picture.
Piippo says she never dreamed of doing a comic, even though she had read Donald Ankka, Tintin and Asterix from an early age.
I was last drawn as a child, but when these manuscripts of Luomuhömpä began to emerge, the situation changed.
I did a few dozen scripts in the drawer at the beginning.
My daughter, Viivi Valkama (p. 2000), is a clever cartoonist, but I was not attracted to her until the summer of 2016 when I bribed her with the help of a drawing board.
It took a dozen stripes to get her enthusiasm, and then she was forced to start trying herself, laughing at Piippo, who says the drawing board was a big catalyst for her.
The drawing board is an easy and convenient instrument to try to get something done.
On paper, I was not even trying to draw, says Piippo about his relationship with the drawing, which he usually practises in the evenings.
The manuscripts keep popping up, but usually I do not get ready at once.
One three-screen stripe takes up to more than one hour.
I may do the screens at a time and I am happy to play with the colors.
Starting drawing is always the hardest thing, because drawing is not my strongest sport.
Sari Piippo says he appreciates the newspaper's current comics, including Scott Adams's Dilbert.
The persons of Luomuhömpä are the mother-of-two, who has a salad hair cushion, who has been shaken up in the L theme.
Other persons include the man, Pissis, and the man.
In the world of Luomuhömpä, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from your own life and social media.
Sari Piippo does not want to preach or offer a compulsion, even if there is an intrusion between the creatures.
Piippo says she is reading her series with her husband and children.
After all, it is such a wonderful feeling when you look at the comics you have drawn and say that this is what I have done today.
And challenges are enough for the housewife!
The series "Luomuhömppäs" can be read online at organic omppa.comic blog
Lotto's million-pound was left swelling - these were the correct numbers

Indonesia earthquake: air traffic controllers sacrificed themselves - not leaving the cracking tower until they got hundreds of passengers to safety
Anthonius Gunawan Agung, a 21-year-old air traffic controller, has emerged as the hero of Indonesia's earthquake.
Agung was left alone in the air traffic control tower until a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people safely made the journey from an island shaken by the earthquake.
The young man was in the air traffic control of Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in the city of Palu when the earthquake struck on Friday.
As others fled the air traffic control tower, Agung refused to leave his seat before being escorted from the runway of the Batik Air passenger plane.
In doing so, he was able to save hundreds of lives, Indonesia's Aviation Administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The air traffic control tower was stalking and cracking.
Eventually, Agung tried to save himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg was broken and he suffered serious internal life injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was scheduled to be transported by helicopter to a better equipped facility, but died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, an aviation administration spokesman told The Jakarta Post.
The quake continued to strengthen as the flight entered the air, and its intensity was eventually measured at 7.5 magnitude.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian Aviation Administration has respected Agung's heroism on social media.

Rehn reflected on Europe's end to the trade war: "let's watch the next tweet"
The U.S.-China trade war is mirrored in the global economy as a whole.
Growth forecasts have been calculated across Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly reduced its own economic growth estimates.
In Yle's top statement, President Rehn said that although the escalating tension has no direct impact on European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which is reflected in the investment decisions of businesses.
The situation also concerns the export of Finnish businesses.
For the time being, Rehn thinks that Europe is very much in a baking mood.
It has been able to build an intermediate peace with the United States and has also helped calm the situation with China and Japan.
In Rehn's view, Europe does not seem to be grinding through a trade war.
Keep looking at the next tweet and then evaluate it.
We have a pretty unpredictable partner in the direction of Washington, however, "he said in an interview with Yle.
Europe also faces risks of its own.
One of them is Italy, the eurozone's third largest national economy, which is also one of the most indebted nations in the eurozone and the western world.
Markets reacted dramatically yesterday evening to the deficit budget presented clearly by the Italian government on Thursday evening.
Next year's deficit is over 2.4 per cent of the national product.
Rehn finds the situation in Italy worrying.
Five per cent of the country's borrowing stock is problem credit and unarranged credit is more than ten per cent.
Moreover, its public finances are in weak straits and the country appears to be again exceeding its commitment to its European partners.
It might not be worth painting further crises, Rehn replied when asked whether Italy would take Europe to a new economic crisis.
The second issue facing Europe is Britain's departure from the EU.
Rehn hoped it would be in harmony.
A confrontational difference would have much more negative effects.
Rehn took over as head of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), will withdraw after just over a year.

NHS super-popular box office performances will continue again next week - the last tickets for Helsinki are on sale
The popular box sets, organised by Helsinki Sanomat, will continue again this week.
The other performances will be seen at the National Theatre on October 2nd, 8th and 11th.
On 23 October, the box will visit Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets for sale at the National Theatre.
Tampere's proposal has been finished.
Tickets sell Lippu.fi.
During the evening, journalists and photographers on the platform will tell the true story they have long prepared, which has not previously been published in any NHS instrument.
Again, there is something that nobody has ever heard.
"It is a weird spy in Helsinki night, an impressive reportage from the other side of the globe and a talking story about a very topical health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the black box producers.
After the presentation, the public will have the opportunity to meet with NHS journalists and photographers and continue the conversation.
Helsinki's Sanomat has been organising the evening of live journalism for three years.
From the outset, they have been popular and often finished.
More than 15,000 people have already visited the crowd.
The black box was awarded at the Bonnier Awards as a journalistic act of the year.
The laureates thanked the new way of doing journalism, as well as the desire of journalists to come close to their readers.

Missing mushroom inhibitor found thanks to an "unbiased experiment"
Finnish police drone skills top the world: "we are being asked about training"
According to the headteacher of the College of Policing, the police can use the drone in addition to the search for the missing, for example in crime scene investigations and intelligence missions.
On Tuesday, a police officer managed to find a mushroom inhibitor who disappeared in Raahe with the help of a drone in just one minute.
Kimmo Himberg, vice-chancellor of the College of Policing, referred to the incident and mentioned, among other things, that "through an unbiased experiment and effective education, we are also at the forefront of the world."
The drone is quite a new rebellion, and even newer in the police duties.
Nowhere are there any statistics that the Finnish police are the champion of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong perception that this is the case.
This has become clear, for example, when the experience of the Finnish police has been reported at international events.
There is an awful lot of interest in it elsewhere, Himberg says.
It would be hard for visitors to watch the Finnish police drone activity.
We are being asked about training.
Becoming even more common
Mr Himberg reminds that finding someone missing in Finnish winter conditions as soon as possible is very important.
As has been said, in Raahe's case, the lost drone was found in just one minute.
Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
Himberg says they are expected to be educated further.
Already the drone is used in police duties, and it is becoming more common and more common in the future.
That is what I would dare to say, "Himberg says.
As well as searching for the missing, police can use drones for example in accident or crime scene investigations and certain types of intelligence missions, according to Himberg.
For example, there is already a need to check a region a little further afield, where there is potentially a fear that there will be violence.
The drone can then be used for prior intelligence.

AV Rugby rose to number one
On Saturday, AV Rugby celebrated the win in the division 2 division.
The Yankees were still in the middle of the match with a 7-12 defeat to Helsinki Rugby Club, but found a plot in the second period and whispered the South's guests 26-12.
At the same time, the 2-division championship knew about the historic rise to Division 1 of the World Championship in the country.
In the past, the club has played at number one, but at the time the Finnish rugby league was divided into two levels, a Championship series and a multimillion-dollar division 1.
The club is going to take the league seat, but it knows quite a bit of work for next winter.
The current roster of less than two dozen players must be brought up to 25.
The Division 1 also knows the growth in the number of games and longer journeys, so the fundraising must also be in line with that.

Kotkanemi starts season in Montreal, confirms head coach
Claude Julien, the head coach of the Montreal Canadiens, who is playing in the NHL, confirmed on the club's Twitter account that Finnish striker Jesside Kotkanemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked a super pledge in the first round with Eagles, 18, at number three in the summer draft.
The striker joined the Montreal training strength in late summer and has made strong remarks during September's practice matches.
In his first practice match, Kotkanemi managed to score a goal.
Head coach Julien praised Finn for taking big developments after arriving at the rookie camp.

What is a good leader like?
There has been a lot of talk about leadership in Finland this week.
In an interview with the NHS, the chairman of Nokia, Ricky Siilasmaa, told a Paranoid optimist that he would shed light on his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticises the leadership of his predecessor Jorma Ollila.
The accusations were vehemently denied, but previous Nokia reports have also discussed the inability of executives to act as a team; the fear and lack of speech that caused the mobile phone business to collapse.
The risk-taking capacity and ketchup of the company's upward stage disappeared.
Also during the week, a business giant event was held in Helsinki at the Nordic Business Forum, which drew Finnish business cream to the Messo Centre.
In addition to Barack Obama, 12 stars from the business world rose to the stage.
It was enough to talk about good leadership.
Gary Hamel, a legend of management lessons, said that a good manager should have the courage to take the company to the future, even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that the decisions are made by those who are most mentally connected to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, founder of Whole Foods, a chain known for its vast organic range, said the director must be able to communicate to all staff the company's purpose.
And that purpose cannot just be to make a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote a success book about introverts, told me that the most successful leaders are studied humble.
They act calmly, quietly and purposefully.
Often they are introverts.
Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor, reminded that the characteristics of a good manager must coincide with the stage of the company's life cycle.
In the early stages of the company, the director must know how to tell the story on which the company's future is based.
The company, which has grown into a mature phase, needs a leader who knows the numbers.
At the Nordic Business Forum, 7,500 visitors - mainly Finnish executives - listened to these lessons.
They were in danger of being informed.
A lot is required of a good leader.
That is why leadership so often goes wrong, including at the highest level.
Also present were Siilasmaa and Olja.
They chatted with each other behind the scenes in a comrade manner.
But they are unlikely to wonder whether they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And it was not easy for an outsider to judge their humility.

Macedonia's name has caused decades of dissent - now the people are voting in contentious elections
The proposal for a new name for the country is currently being voted on in Macedonia in the Balkans.
According to the agreement between the Macedonian and Greek governments, the republic of northern Macedonia would be named.
Until now, Greece has blocked its veto over Macedonia's efforts to become a member of Nato and the EU.
According to Greece, Macedonia's name belongs to its northern province.
The referendum question does not mention a new name, but rather questions whether the voter supports Macedonia's membership of the EU and NATO by accepting the treaty.
The vote started sluggishly, at least at a school in the centre of the capital Skopje.
Olivera Argirosvka, a retired nurse who voted at the school, wanted support for the agreement.
The referendum will mean a change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
It is a change, especially for young people, he said.
The name of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been used in official contexts since its independence in 1991.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's government has campaigned for the agreement to be approved.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, whether the turnout will rise above the 50 per cent required is sufficient.
The referendum is not binding, but the victory of the "yes" votes would give the mandate to amend the constitution.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required for a constitutional amendment.
The agreement must also be approved by the Greek parliament.

Erkan Teperin was knocked down by Robert Helenius
Late on Saturday evening, Robert Helenius met Erkan Teperin during a professional boxing match in Germany.
The 34-year-old Finn took a measure of his 36-year-old German opponent at the Waldenbuch in Stuttgart.
The main match of the evening was the IBF heavyweight Intercontinental title match.
The winner can open up the possibility of a match in the harder tasks seen on Saturday, with significant financial significance.
Helenius settled for the match in the eighth set, when he knocked Teper out with a heavy left-hand strike.
Teper was no longer able to rise from the floor.
"Nordic Nightmare" hurt his opponent early in the third set, when blood started bleeding from the German nose.
Helenius and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They had to take it back in December 2015.
Teper then appealed for an injury and withdrew from the match.
It then emerged that the German had shook hands twice during a doping test.
Helenius has taken 28 matches from his professional career and suffered two defeats.
Teper, who has gone into the match as a clear favourite, has won 19 professional matches in his career and lost three times.

Canada fights time to reach agreement on NAFTA with USA
Time is threatening to end in the middle of negotiations between the United States and Canada on a free trade agreement with NAFTA.
The United States has set a deadline for Sunday, and negotiators from the two countries have been talking closely through the weekend.
Canada's chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed her speech at the UN General Assembly in order to focus fully on trade negotiations.
At the insistence of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached agreement with each other, but agreement has not yet been reached with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want to bring the agreement into force before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won Mexico's presidential election, takes office in early December.
Trump has said that Canada's involvement in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that there are plans to sign the agreement at the end of November - whether Canada is involved or not.
Because of these schedules, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday to give the United States Congress sufficient time to evaluate it.

Police apprehended 11 people after Honka-HJK match - fracking on the ground and at a subway station
Eleven people were apprehended by police after the Honka-HJK match of the men's soccer league in Espoo on Saturday, detective superintendent of the West Uudenmaa Police Department confirmed to STT.
The basis for this was to protect against crime and disorder.
Those apprehended were released after the situation had calmed down, he said.
The catches were reported earlier by Ilta-Sanomat.
The match ended 0-0.
After the final whistle, a large crowd of viewers rushed to the field from the crowd reserved for HJK supporters.

Students play a rare delicacy: the ancient tragedy - the simplistic Oresteia affects their visuals
Ancient tragedies are a rare delicacy on Finnish stage.
At the National Theatre, for example, the last time we have seen an ancient tragedy, Sofokleen Filoktetes, was in 1988.
Now, the theatrical school introduced the only remaining play trilogy, the Oresteia of Aiskhylos, to the tour from the National Theatre.
During the 2015 Lavat Open! Projects, the actor students at the theatre school will work with the professional director internationally.
The director of this fourth project, such as the first one, is Ms Roihan, who lives in Berlin.
Oresteia premiered in Berlin in April.
Roihan's reconciliation from Oresteia summarises the report on the end of the bloodshed of the doomed Atreus family and the rule of law, to the credit, for an hour to twenty minutes, especially by intensifying the chorus contributions.
The book manages to be very faithful to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsuuri's fine Finn (2003).
The dramatic lights, and the presentation of the theatre space pages, highlight simplistic and bright stage thinking.
At the heart of it is the dynamic between the performers who break away from the chorus, who play the title roles, and the chorus.
The proposal uses both double and triple name roles.
The actors do not leave the stage at all, so, for example, the murders of Agamemnon and Kassandra, who returns from the war in Troia, are shown on stage, contrary to the tradition of antiquities.
Of course, the proposal does not stress that it is faithful to the ancient agenda tradition.
Rather, a modern, faithful interpretation of the text is created in front of the viewer's eyes, constantly aware of its ritual roots.
Roihan has succeeded in bringing out the masters stage as a close group of actor students, nothing less than one organization, a rhythmic array.
Especially in the chorus sections, actors who bend themselves to very expressive, sculptural group formations will be able to get to their rights on the naked, just adorned with a white curtain, on stage.
Impressive.
Oresteia's presentation tour will continue with Kouvola's and the European Theatre.

On several occasions, the fist fiddled in Kajaan
A man in his late 30s assaulted three men in and out of a restaurant in downtown Kajaan on Saturday morning.
The man first knocked one man inside the restaurant, causing him to be removed.
Outside, he kicked another man to the ground, and when the third man intervened, the assailant beat him, too.
The assailant was apprehended by police.
At the police station, the man continued to behave aggressively and kick the other officer in the leg.
The man also threatened police with assault and killing.
The man was taken to the pipeline to calm down.
The matter is being investigated as three assaults and violent protests against the officer.
In downtown Kajaani, another assault incident occurred in Central Street on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
The victim was first knocked down by a man who was about 20 years old.
A short time later, another man brought him to the ground and the man who had previously hit him still kicked the victim.
Outsiders pulled the assailants further away from the victim and police were called.
However, the perpetrators already have time to leave before the police arrive.
Police are appealing for witnesses to the incident to contact Kajaan police by telephone 0295 416

I also spoke in the lawsuit about the employment environment expert of the Service Employment Union (PAM), Erika Soldier.
He says the crime statistics do not indicate the actual situation.
The problem is growing, although of course employers claim otherwise.
Only cases that have been experienced clearly go to the attention of the police, and many correct incidents of violence remain unreported.
"Companies certainly have a responsibility to statistically determine their near-term situation on the basis of the Employment Safety Act, but these statistics remain for internal use and their data is not collected anywhere," he said.
Mental injuries do not end up in the statistics.
The problem with violence has always been that they do not always have physical injuries.
Nevertheless, psychological trauma can be much more serious than bruises and wounds.
The difference between the violence situation and the threatening violence situation is difficult to draw when aggressive threats of a certain level have to be counted as violence - even if they do not exist.
Too many people are afraid in their workplace, even if the actual act does not happen.

The shop has acquired guards.
When the opening hours of the shops were released, there was also a period of high-profile silliness in the media about its effects on the safety of the sellers.
"Then quite a few employers organised guard services, at least for nighttime hours, as well as to prevent working alone," he commented.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is reached.
This would seem to have had an effective effect now, but this will produce a new negative trend.
When, as a result of the guard, the distractions remained well in possession, the impression emerged that the guard would be unnecessary.
Now, many places are trying to find solutions that could remove expensive security guard services.
Mild assault is a complainant crime, and it is quite understandable that a seller who has been assaulted does not want to make a request for an investigation into a criminal who usually lives near a shop.
But according to the same subparagraph of the law, which was enacted in 2011, mild assault will become subject to prosecution if it occurs in the workplace.

Heidi Sohlberg signed for the miss before the live broadcast began - "Sara, Iiro is married"
The crowning of the miss will not be seen in the traditional way on TV this year, but will be shown on the Viafree website.
The broadcast is run by former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and Iiro Harjula, host of the NHL and KHL studios Viasat and Viaplay.
Janni Hussi is the presenter of the backstage and red carpet.
Before the live broadcast, the presenter trio told visitors and media representatives who had arrived.
Sohlberg initially asked the audience to give Harjula a resounding round of applause.
Now all the women are screaming!
Now look at this male presenter, Sohlberg spun his colleagues as the audience cheered.
The front-row games will be watched by many Miss Finland in previous years.
Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi, among others, sat side by side and Sohlberg threw a small joke in either direction.
Sara, Iiro is married!
Sohlberg logged on to the series.
More probably, Sohlberg referred to Sohlberg, who has just resigned, laughing at the comment, even though he seemed confused at first.
Sieppi spoke about his resignation for the first time in Ilta-Sanomat's weekend newspaper.
The mistress said she did not want to open up the reasons for the discrepancy in public, as it is a matter between her and Scrooge Salminen.
She said she was not in a hurry for a new relationship, but was going to focus on herself.
I am focusing on my own stuff, and in particular I am starting to take my own life alone, "Sara Sieppi told me.
Harjula's marriage claim came up at a later stage when Sohlberg accidentally got it wrong to call Janni Hussi and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The presenter trio laughed at the moka.

The bottom man tortured his tied unmarried spouse by nagging, burning and feeding a spirit sauce
The North District Court has sentenced a 34-year-old man to three years in prison for the multiple offences committed against his unmarried spouse.
For example, the offence involved belt, cable and lump ties.
The court condemned the objects in question as lost to the state.
Rankin was charged with the alleged aggravated rape.
However, the district attorney dismissed this indictment.
Four assaults, aggravated assault, coercion, unlawful threats, deprivation of freedom, aggravated deprivation of freedom, and two counts of criminal damage were read as the cause of the killer.
The crimes took place between March 26 and May 24 last year.
At the end of the last act, the man was apprehended and detained a few days later.
In the past week on Thursday, the North District Court handed down its sentence and ordered the 34-year-old to remain in the prison in Vaasa.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also charged with two counts of aggravated deprivation of freedom and aggravated rape on May 22.
However, the justices dismissed these charges as unproven.
The case was heard in court behind closed doors.
However, the district judge issued a public statement on the sentence.
The district judge said the defendant had targeted his spouse for violence, threats and coercion in situations where he had been bound.
The accused slit his victim with a knife, smoked a cigarette, fed spirit sauce and poured water and coffee on top of it.
By sentencing, the court ordered the state to lose the criminal equipment: belt and cable, lump ties, bath belt, knife and watershed.
Four witnesses
According to the district court, the parties continued to live together between the actions.
You can read from the sentencing statement that a large number of the most outrageous acts took place at the end of the crime period.
The court heard four witnesses, two women and two men.
The 34-year-old must pay compensation for pain, crack, suffering and temporary harm totalling EUR 5800.
He hardly has the money in question, as the offender already has debts to recover from his old age.
The custodial sentence is not the man's first.
This newspaper does not reveal the name of the offender to protect the victim's privacy.

Europe in four-point lead over Ryder Cup solution
On Saturday, European golf professionals solidified their lead in a traditional thigh game against the United States.
Europe leads the Ryder Cup on the outskirts of Paris by 10 points to 6, with twelve singles still to be played on Sunday.
Europe won three of the four four-ball matches that started Saturday, and in the afternoon doubles the victories were matched 2-2.
The European leaders were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches they played on Friday and Saturday.
In the past, no European couple had reached the equivalent.
On Sunday, the couple are aiming for more history.

HJK denounces the fierce harassment of its supporters during Honka match: "violence does not belong in football"
HJK, the national football lottery team, issued a statement on Sunday condemning the disruption of its supporters during Saturday's FC Honka match in Tapiola.
"We regret the events following the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," the statement said.
After the match ended, about 50 HJK supporters rushed to the field and some appeared to be seeking to challenge the dispute with supporters in Hong Kong.
There were also fights between supporters.
The officers were not able to calm the situation down, but police officers and also mounted officers were required to attend.
HJK says in a statement that the team's players and staff are shocked by what happened.
What happened after the match is not in keeping with the values of our traditional 111-year-old club.
"We strongly dissociate ourselves from any activity that compromises the safety of match-fixing events," the statement said.
HJK promises to assist authorities and event organisers in identifying factors threatening security and eliminating the side-effects.
The culture of supporters is part of football and an important issue for HJK.

Filipino inventor flies in drone car - thus avoiding traffic congestion
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and something like Pelle Peloton.
He is now among a growing number in the world who vow to come up with a flying car - or at least his own version of it.
As rivals, for example, he has such factors as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in mass production of his equipment.
According to reports from the world, the man has spent much of his fortune building his dream.

He now calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he made his first successful test flight - he slipped over seven metres on his device.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic congestion.

JHL anticipates: the industrial action starting tomorrow will be seen in children's day care and social and health services
In the public and welfare sectors, tomorrow's overtime and altercation bans will be particularly apparent in the social and health services, as well as in childcare, according to the president of JHL, Ms Niemi-Laine.
The effects will be widespread, and they will certainly be reflected in the way that there are not enough personnel present.
Everyone has to think about which way to apply for their child.
It is now up to the employer to ensure that the services are playing and that no one's life is threatened, Niemi-Laine tells STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the lack of employees was also evident at the beginning of the year, when JHL members were banned from overtime and altercation due to contract negotiations.
Through the flexibility, employers have made it possible for staff not to be hired, but for employees to stay overtime or switch shifts.
This is not an industrial action yet.
It is just the norm, protectively, that for every employee, you take care of regular working hours and you just do them.
By means of the measures, it opposes the government's intention to reduce redundancy protections for small businesses.
Mark Jalonen, head of the labour market for employers, will not prejudge the effects of overtime and exchange bans.
However, he does not believe they are very revolutionary, although services can deteriorate.
Employers across Finland are aware of this and are preparing what can be done.
The area is so impossibly vast, the social and health measures and the technical sector are difficult to say.
The effects can vary widely by region, by region and by employer, Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen says there were already experiences in the past week, including similar actions by the neighbouring and primary carers union Superi and the social and health trade union Tehy, which took three days to complete.
Their effects were pretty limited.
JHL's ban on overtime and exchange applies, for example, to municipalities, church, state and private social and health workers.
For example, family nurses have been restricted to the outside.
At this stage, the industrial action affects almost 100,000 JHL members.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL's actions may take a long time.
The league has also prepared for other industrial action if preparations for the redundancy act continue.
The government should now acknowledge that it is running against the wall and hard.
Jalonen believes that both the trade movement and the government must come to terms with it.
It is extraordinary that the hard ones are already in the pipeline, even though the presentation has not been given yet, "Jalonen said in an update.

A large coral reef is created with children and adults - in the fitness circles of the presentation, the gestures of a rainbow and a sea horse are studied
The Great Korallireutta, a collective in other spaces, premiered last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday was presented for the second time in Finland, this time in the house of Finland.
Like the previous works of the group, the Great Korallireutta is a work that will be built from start to finish together with the public.
This time, however, a clearer proposal will also be built, which will refresh and encapsulate the observations made in the initial rehearsals.
In theatre, there is enough fairytale magic for child participants, too.
The child's perspective has already been included in the preparation phase of the book.
However, the great Korallireutta is not a children's proposal, but a proposal made by adults and children in co-operation.
It gives adults information and observations about the way children accept information and make art.
The ability of children to indulge in rehearsals and joint plays also means the distance between adults and children.
There is a certain amount of fairy ballet, fitness and natural consciousness, but once and for all it goes viral in different, non-human conditions around the visits.
The large coral reef starts with getting to know the movements of coral and coral reef organisms and fish.
Six different fitness districts learn, for example, the gestures of a rainbow and a sea horse.
Finally, a presentation of less than an hour, in which music, lights and shiny paints and costumes help to explore the life of the coral reef.
There are both diving people in the large coral reef who are watching the life of the coral reef and the corals that are being looked at.
There are also organisms looking at corals.
The eyes and observations shown in many directions make the presentation dense and life-changing.
Whether it is the scenery of an organism, the scenery that looks at the landscape, and the other one that looks at the organism, or the landscape - and all this at the same time.
It does not seem difficult for children in any way.
At other facilities, the group is working towards the border between thinking and acting, which is challenging when the group consists of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more significant.
After the workshop, there will be a silent demonstration on behalf of the endangered corals in Sitrator.

Kids grow up too fast - I am happy there were no smartphones in my childhood
Today's children and young people are becoming more irresponsible.
Young people start smoking cigarettes and drinking all the time when they are younger and younger.
I believe that children should be children throughout their childhood, and not mess with their lives because of substance abuse and sex, because others say they do.
I was taken aback when my buddy told me that he had been forced to retrieve his fifth-grade sister over the weekend from a "boyfriend."
When she came to retrieve her drunk sister, she told about her sex experience from that evening.
I could not possibly imagine my own sister in the same situation because we have been told and warned throughout our childhood that substance abuse must not be touched and sex is an adult affair.
I wish the children of modern times could live a decent childhood, and they would not have to grow up too soon because of the group pressure created by the guys.

Yle: authorities told state leadership that the incident in Airiston is not related to national security
According to Mr Kanerva, who was interviewed by Mr Yle, the conservation police and the armed forces visited the defence and foreign affairs committees earlier this week.
The Finnish state leadership has been told that the Airiston Helme investigation is not currently related to national security, but to organised crime, reported Yle.
The information of the sources, who appeared anonymously, was confirmed by the chairman of the defence committee, Mr Kanerva (IOC).
Kanerva said the armed forces and the protection police went to the defence and foreign affairs committees this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is primarily considered economic crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that there was anything else here, Kanerva commented in an interview with Yle.
Yle reports that so far no evidence of a link to national security has been found in the material seized, but the investigation is in its infancy.
There is nothing we can know about what can be revealed from there, "one of Yle's interviewees says.

Video: dream goal saved Liverpool defeat series
Liverpool's 100 per cent Premier League start came to an end, but it was still a happier team for the 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.
Sunday marks exactly one year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and got away with a 1-0 win.
Then the combination of Pep Guardiola sent a signal to the Premier League as a whole that City were serious now.
Everyone remembers how last season ended.
And, surely, Liverpool manager JSQrgen Klopp arrived with the same idea in west London.
The Red had started the Premier League with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool started stronger and Virgil van Dijk, in particular, seemed to dominate his own end of the field alone.
Chelsea, meanwhile, had a fine league Cup win over Anfield Road on Wednesday.
That is when Eden Hazard came off the bench to solve the match with a wonderful individual performance.
Now, of course, from the early minutes, Hazard was involved.
In the 25th minute, he was batting first in a small space with the three-game Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Eventually, the Croat saw Hazard plunge forward, sending a perfectly weighted pass.
Hazard found himself little on the edge of the penalty area, but from there bombed a complete left-foot pull into the back corner.
Pool brass guard Alisson was a bit slow in his fight and did not get his finger on the ball.
Klopp certainly felt the defeat position was lightly unfair, because almost immediately after Antonio
During the second period, Chelsea waterman Kepa also got into action.
The Basque guard reacted quickly to Sadio Mané's pull and pushed the ball from the roots to a corner kick.
At the other end, Alisson zeroed in to throw Hazard through.
The best place for the guests came in the 72nd minute when James Milner found Bobby Firmino with his concentration.
However, the brass star's push was directed towards team-mate David Luiz, who saved the hosts the lead.
It did not last again in the 89th minute, when the replacement Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot from 25 metres.
Sturridge played in his old home stadium and, to his credit, the striker bombed an irresistible draw into the top corner.
Liverpool's 100 per cent league start came to an end with a 1-1 draw, but they are still top of the league - together with Manchester City.
Chelsea are also tightly involved in the championship fight, two points behind the top.

In the transfer debate, the poterots are deep
I remember when, a decade ago, a newspaper asked a variety of Finnish influencers what divides the Finnish people.
Juice Leskinen's answer remained the only one: the Nen Decision.
Some people's surname has a Nen terminal and some do not.
Jakolinjo can be born wherever it is, and there was one bidder here.
Finland has achieved in the EU that the annual cellphone transfer is being abandoned.
A lot of people agree that the transfer of clocks twice a year has been foolish and has caused a whole range of problems.
Eventually, at least in Finland, this achievement seems to be the easiest stage for a solution, although it has not been easy.
The hardest thing now is to resolve where you end up at the end of the day: the current summer or winter time or some other time zone.
The people will also be able to express their opinion on this on the Ofsted page.
The poll has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and will be open until Friday, October 12.
There is a fierce debate on the coffee tables and on social media, and everyone has their say.
Those defending the winter period justify their position with the impact of the morning light on people's wellbeing and summer time, defending the impact of the evening light on people's outdoor desire and, consequently, on their wellbeing.
Both positions have their firm supporters and good arguments.
According to the study, the morning light rhythms the human day and gives vibrancy.
On the other hand, if you do not particularly suffer from waking up in the dark, you increase the brightness of people moving outdoors and give better opportunities for autumn backyards, for example.
The amount of extra light after a normal working day has already been reduced to an hour.
Ideally, I would take both, but bad enough for our location in the northern corner of the Earth, we cannot do anything.
The winters are too dark and the summers are too bright for many anyway.
What is typical of the discussion on the subject is that one's view is being promoted and the other's view is very strongly opposed.
You just do not listen to the arguments of the opposite party, because the most important thing is how you feel about yourself.
As there is an opinion from almost everyone, it is somewhat pointless to try to turn one's head.
That is where the gunpowder is wasted.
It is an awfully easy topic to discuss, because it does not require a great deal of engagement, and there is enough mutuality to justify it.
There is usually the sharpest and equally fruitless dispute about similar issues.
It is a pity if the wrong alternative is chosen, but you do not want to adapt either.
And it always offers an appropriate scapegoat if life feels ape.
I cannot believe that the sparkling Ethel who has an angel smile and the most beautiful body in the Midwest...
Josba fought a narrow foreign win
Josba's first outing in Divari produced a full three set points against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba went on a jubilant 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) triumph on his way home.
Nurmo still led by goal at the start of the third set, but Josba sought textures and recycled men in chains.
In time, the brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi had a 6-5 winning streak.
Both teams played crucial minutes in the ice jump.
Josba's most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2 + 1).
Kakkosketju was a firepower anyway, when he was also hit (1 + 1), Jere Charles (1 + 0) and Jere also (1 + 0).
Miika Kosonenkin (1 + 0) also played her goal at the time of birth.
Josba has six points after three rounds.
The next one will be O2, in two weeks' time.

200th anniversary celebrations at the church in Eno on Sunday
The 200th anniversary of the Eno church will be celebrated tomorrow, Sunday, partly in a very sad mood.
The arson of the church a week ago was a shock.
Eno's church was also guarded during the two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still a place of celebration.
Although no one would like to, the Church of Eno is now the oldest church in the parish consortium.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno, despite all the municipalities and other unions in the world.
The family situation starts at Eno Church at 10pm today.
The congregation house will then be moved to the cattle's length table.
Throughout the day, the programme has all kinds of things, both inside and outside.
For example, the church building can be accessed with the guidance of a retired parish champion who has spent 37 years as a parish champion.
The birthday celebration of the church also marks the end of one era.
The parish house, which was already decommissioned in 1982, will keep its doors open for the last time today.
Now we are in the crowds in the former borough, "says Mark Koistinen.
The parish house was destroyed by internal air problems, but the church has been in a healthy position for the past 200 years.

Elon Musk steps down as head of Tesla government speech - Petos charges agreed to $40 million
Electric car maker Tesla and company chief executive Elon Musk have agreed their lawsuit with the SEC, the US securities regulator.
The SEC suspected that Musk was guilty of securities fraud, and Musk was at risk of being sidelined by the company he founded.
However, Musk will be allowed to continue as chief executive of Tesla.
Instead, Musk will have to step down from the seat of Tesla's chairman for three years.
The company will have to hire an external board chairman.
Musk will also face tougher scrutiny.
According to the agreement, Tesla must hire two independent directors and monitor Musk's communications more closely in the future.
Tesla and Musk will also pay $20m (£17m) each to settle the case.
"The decision is meant to prevent further market disruption and harm to Tesla shareholders," Steven Peikin, SEC director, said.
The case was sparked in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he may be pulling the company out of the stock market.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding is secure.
The tweet temporarily raised Tesla's share price.
The SEC suspected Musk was guilty of securities fraud.
According to the agency, the tweet was false and misleading, and Musk had not spoken about the arrangement with the company's other management or potential donors.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
The SEC said on Friday it would sue the company and Musk.
The SEC said it called for Musk to be fined and banned from running any more listed companies.
The SEC's challenge spooked investors, and Tesla shares went down sharply.

Indonesia quake and tsunami killed more than 800 people
The number of people killed in Indonesia's earthquake and subsequent tsunami has risen to at least 832, according to AFP.
The death toll is still believed to be increasing, as it is ongoing to determine the damage.
Vice President Jusuf Kalla says the final figure may reach thousands.
The earthquake on Friday stirred up a tsunami that tsunami the city of Palu on the island of Sulawesi.
A warning was issued immediately after the quake, which was quickly cancelled.
According to the authorities, almost all of the known dead are from Palu, at least for the time being.
For example, rescue officials are concerned about the Donggala area near the centre of the quake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Already, several people are known to have died.
Calls for help from the ruins
Indonesia's military has been alerted to rescue workers in search of victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived in the affected area today, urged the soldiers to continue their rescue efforts without exhaustion in the days and nights.
One of the centrepieces of the rescue is a hotel in Palu, which is still believed to have between 50 and 60 people in the ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, the head of the agency leading the rescue effort, told that one person was exhumed alive at night from the ruins of the Roa-Roa Hotel, which is popular with business travellers.
We also heard people's requests for help, he told me.
Syaug said heavy clearance equipment would quickly be needed for the quake and tsunami area.

Politicians' phone numbers leaked into the hands of troublemakers in Britain
Many British politicians were subjected to harassment when their contact details were leaked due to shortcomings in the encryption of the app.
Among other things, the troublemakers were able to access ministers' phone numbers.
It was an application used at the Conservative Party conference in Britain, which is in government.
For example, Michael Gove, the Minister for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, were the targets of harassment.
Several MPs received harassment calls.
Due to the lack of encryption, the public was able to access the profiles of politicians who were on the mobile app of the Conservative Party's annual conference.
The audience was able to access the profiles using a politician's email address, which was easily accessible online.
The person who logged on to the profile was able to watch and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to change for a moment Boris Johnson's profile photo to insult a pornographic image and title.
The image of media mogul Rupert Murdoch was exchanged as a profile photo of Michael Gove.
Dawn Foster, a columnist for The Guardian, described the problem by writing that the meeting application allows people to log on to other people's profiles with their email addresses.

A spokesman for the Conservative Party apologised for the leak.
He said technical problems had been resolved and the application was now working safely.
The British Information Authority (ICO) supported the leak.
The application was produced by Australian Crown Comms.

Every week, there is a large crowd of clapping Poles in the audience of The Wall Suomi quiz
Discerning viewers drew attention to the reactions of the studio audience of The Wall Suomi quiz program.
The rapidly spreading US format The Wall landed in Finland as a version of the four last Saturday.
The game show, hosted by Mr Paasonen, is filmed in Poland in the same studio where other international productions of the format are made.
The possibilities of filming in the Polish studio were extraordinary, as the format's big 12-metre high playing walls required space from the farm.
During the launch period, a studio audience for the program was raised on social media, which was bet Polish.
On Twitter, there was a debate about whether the Poles, perhaps sitting in the studio, understood anything about the game being played in Finnish.
Unne Sormunen, head of domestic programmes at Nelonen, tells this newspaper.
He says that in the studio audience there are players close to him, other Finns, expatriates living in Poland, as well as just Polish viewers.
The audience is made up of international claps in Finnish production, just like the audiences of The Wall episodes depicted in the same state of production in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such crowds, known as professional audiences, who visit the descriptions of different programmes, Sormune says.
He reminds that watching the game itself is not so opaque, even if you do not understand the language in which it is played.
It is easy to distinguish between red and green balls falling off the wall.
However, there are interpreters present in the studio for foreign-speaking speakers who carry out the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret what is happening to the studio director as a simultaneous interpretation.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells what kind of scanning is being thrown there, for example, and what the situation is going on, Sormunen says.
He compares the situation with how David Hasselhoff was delivered recently in domestic production.
A few years ago, David Hasselhoff was involved in Talent Finland's portrayal of us in Finland.
Throughout, she became simulated in her ear, knowing everything that was said in the descriptions about Finnish, Sormune's sum.

The sky of the ace darkened even more
It is been a bad start to the season for Ace.
The sky already darkened almost quickly when the team lost 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1) at home to Vaasan Sport on Saturday.
The Ports now have five consecutive losses, scoring a total of two points from round six.
No ace defender or player from two lower chains has scored yet.
The pressures are also increasing all the time.
Against Sports, the audience was already out of the hall when almost half of the game remained.
Six games have only just been played, and of course there is no reason to give up.
There must be concern, of course, because we played poorly enough.
Especially the second set was disgracefully poor, "Jarno Lakki, who made 1 + 2 for Ace, told me.
For Sport, the win naturally mattered.

7 x the most beautiful light - this is what you recognise as a good light bulb
Resurrect the space, create the right atmosphere for the interior and read the book without tiring.
It is worth a hundred for good lighting.
We collected three good reasons for investing in lighting.
Tarja Jokiniemi, director of sales and marketing at Innolux, gave the tips.
Do a service to your eyes
The importance of lighting is increasing, the more the age years are behind us.
Sufficient light can help with the problems that many people face as they age, as vision accuracy diminishes and more people suffer from dazzling.
As parents, the need for light is also increasing.
Someone in their sixties needs light three times more than someone in their twenties.
The effects of light treatment and the features of the lighting are therefore worth a hundred for health reasons.
A good cast gives enough light, but does not dazzle, Jokiniemi tips.
Create beauty around you
The beautiful interior can only be seen with the right lighting solutions.
The grit of the moment can afford to choose.

Instead of mass production, you want to have a tailored, bold cast in your own home with a story to tell.
People are clearly applying for Finnish and Nordic products whose origins and designers are known.
So let's be very designer aware, "Jokiniemi said.
The home is not necessarily acquired by the latest trendy, but by a timeless classic for which many years have been saved.
Certain kinds of timeless, adorable and elegant classics stick to their guns year after year, Jokiniemi says.

Playing man wants to set an example in recycling - goods go out to the world in recycling boxes, plastic changed to paper
Nowadays, the special game movement Pelimies recycles not only the games, but also the packaging materials.
The products of the bedrock shop customers are no longer packaged in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered online are packed with packaging from importers, for example.
All the packages coming to us go for renewal.
We may use the boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is in the condition that it can be used, "Dennis said of the playing man.
As a cushion material, the company mainly uses newspapers and other similar recycling material.

Russian intelligence services have a long tradition of sabotage
There is no reason to expect the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence SVR or military intelligence GRU to have abandoned this approach.
During the Soviet Union, the so-called DRG groups specialise in sabotage activities.
The name comes from Russian-speaking diversionno-razvedyvatelnaja gruppa: sabotage and intelligence group.
The agents operating in the western countries of the KGB are preparing detailed plans for important sabotage targets, according to Vasili Mitroh (1922- 2004), the archivist who defected to the west of the KGB.
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s
The sites included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, KGB purchased the uniforms and accessories of Bundeswehr, railways, dispute guards and road workers for undercover operations for DRG groups.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014, wearing local Ukrainian police riot gear, setting up checkpoints on roads leading from the peninsula to Ukraine and isolating Crimea from its motherland.
Agents of the Cold War era concealed food packaging for sabotage groups with mines, explosives, detonators and media equipment.

HPK keeps Riska in its ranks for the remainder of the season, leaflet probation expired
The sporting director of the HPK in Helsinki says that Filip Riska (centre) has been important for the team in starts, underperforming and in the defensive role of the four-pitch team.
Filip Riska, who played in the early autumn on probation, will resume the final season of the season at the HPK.
The success of experienced Riska, 33, in the roles offered to him convinced club management.
Filip has been an important piece for us in starts, under-strength play and the defensive role of the four-pitch side.
Although there are still improvements to be made, it is a good thing for the young team to stick to such an experienced player, "HPK sporting director

True story on TV today: climber left to die twice
American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: my Journey Home From Everest is based on a man's own experience.
Tonight's film has been made on the basis of them.
Everest will now premiere on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating snowstorm surprised climbers on Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákuri's 2015 guidance reflects the struggle for survival, which has been handled with grain.
Films - and documentaries - have been made about the tragedy before.
Serious events are also being conducted in this case.
22 years ago, the world's highest mountain took the lives of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced executives of expeditions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who served as Weathers' guide.
Weathers' life may have been saved by eye surgery carried out before leaving for Nepal.
As a result of that and the air pressure, he lost sight, which meant that the conquest of the top had to be missed.
Rob Hall continued the journey and no longer returned.
But the Weathers' struggle for life and death had only just begun.
As the storm went up, he strayed and could no longer find himself back in the camp.
When the man came to search, he was found in such poor condition that there was no belief in survival.
Weathers was left to die.
But miraculously, he still got on his feet and found others.
The badly frowned Weathers was thought to be still dying and, once again, he was left to fend for himself.
What is clear is that, contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers was left alive.
At some point, his fellow climbers began to believe in the possibility that he was given help.
In the film, Beck Weathers is performed by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Without him, we are a dying herd that is not going to get reinforcements.
It is becoming increasingly clear, indeed, that there is a bond between the incompatibility of the European Union's fiscal policies and serious unemployment.

The 200-year-old Eno Church has been celebrated today
Eno's 200-year-old church has been celebrated today on Church Hill.
The church was inaugurated on October 4, 1818, and a celebration was prepared for Sunday to celebrate the whole family.
The celebrations began at 10 pm on the church hill of Eno, followed by the antimia of the cattle's long table at the parish house of Eno.
The church was full.
517 persons participated in the family mouth.
The vicar of Eno, Armi Lake, was delighted that so many people had entered the church.
It will be a great pleasure for a long time to come, and it will give strength to the work, "she said.
The church fire has affected many, and it was not ignored at the 200th anniversary of the Eno congregation.
The Church of Eno is now the oldest church in the evangelical congregations of Helsinki after the destruction of the church in the fire.
The wooden church was completed in 1770.
A harbinger was organised in the morning to silence and commemorate the church that was destroyed in the fire.
Photos and videos: Medikaani dodged his power in Greece - Meri disappeared and the street turned into a river
A powerful hurricane-type September storm rolled from lunch to Greece on Saturday.
The intermediate hurricane, or media, has been designated Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red weather warning for the regions of Attika, Peloponnesos, Joonia Islands, Kyklads and Crete.
Photos taken from the region show plenty of flooding across Greece.
A video posted on Twitter shows how a river has suddenly appeared between houses in the city of Kiaton in the Korinthian area, rather than in the street, due to flooding.
Another video shows how the car has been transported by floodwaters.
Heavy winds in the southern part of the Peloponnesos peninsula caused strong sea visits.
The Finnish embassy in Athens instructs people on its Facebook page to prepare for the storm in Greece.
The embassy urges monitoring of weather information and instructions from local authorities.
The intermediate hurricane, or media, brings heavy rains and even flood hazards.
According to one 2011 study published by CNN, only once or twice a year in the world, typically around September and October, when sea temperatures are still high.
The storm, which is now blowing, left flooding in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey north and towards Europe.
Concerns have also been raised in Greece about refugee camps on the islands, such as Lesbian.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in the camps have limited access to proper shelter.
Also below the storm will be areas destroyed by bushfires around Athens in the summer.

North Woods has a season of killer bees, and do not be annoyed by yellow flying takes, which leads to complications.
We must not go to sea now, but the flights are on schedule - thousands of Finns are currently holidaying on Greek islands threatened by the September storm
Excursions to the sea are cancelled and even when walking, it is worth being careful that no branches or other loose goods are flying on top of the storm.
Such guidelines have allocated a good 3,500 to Finn, who is holidaying through the Sunshine Coast in Greece, over the weekend.
The guidelines will be necessary, as even the Zorbas storm, which is escalating to atrocity levels, has been forecast to ramp up the Greek islands this weekend.
In the vicinity of the island of Crete, for example, wind speeds can reach up to 45 metres per second in the bout.
Heavy rains are contributing to the weather's whistling.
All travellers travelling through the Sunshine and Tui to Greece who have announced their phone numbers have been warned of heavy winds via text message, according to tour operators.
Still in the air, sun and heat
According to Inka Ikoski, a communications expert at Sunshine Coast, by early evening on Saturday, the worst has been avoided at the resorts.
For example, flights have landed and risen according to the normal schedule.
Of course, we are monitoring the situation all the time.
Security goes ahead.
Antonia Schroderus, a media consultant, tells me that their flights have also been on schedule.
We are in constant contact with our staff at the site.
At least Crete was still calm, he said in the early evening on Saturday.
There are currently just over 1,500 Finnish passengers on the most popular Greek islands, namely Rhodes and Crete.
Moreover, a few hundred passengers are holidaying in smaller destinations.
The worst storm on the island of Kos, for example, will arrive on Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, Rodos had spoiled the sun and the temperature climbed to 27 degrees, the Sun's Ikonen reports.
Zorbas is estimated to be the next Turkish nuisance, albeit with some mitigation.
In the event, we have already been in contact with Turkey and our personnel there, and have reviewed, for example, the number of Finnish personnel who have been flying to Tuilla, Schroderus said.

The population of the city of Rome shrank from one million to perhaps 30,000, the largest city in western Europe at the time.
If this question is not answered, the national court must allow the implementation of the European arrest warrant under German law, as all other conditions laid down in that legislation will also be met.

Hussi says she purchased the dresses from Meslew.

Two robot cars start operating in Espoo
They will operate for the remainder of the year and take passengers on board, the city of Espo informs.
Otaniemen's robotic cars will play the role of a bus mechanic, as traffic is expected to be launched on a robot bus in the area next spring.
The project will develop and pilot throughout the year robot vehicle traffic and test the technical functioning of the vehicles in Finnish conditions.
The experiment shows how robotic cars are doing on the current street network.
At the same time, the city is offering robotic bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, said Joan Nyberg, head of traffic management.
For the first time, robotic cars will travel fully automatically among other traffic without specific traffic arrangements.
A passenger sitting on board is always responsible for the safety of the vehicles.
The vehicles are sensing their surroundings all the time with multiple sensors and assessing whether the driving route is free.
If it is not, they will interpret whether the obstacle identified is a vehicle, a bicycle or, for example, a snowflame, according to Harri Santamala, executive director of Sensible 4, which is responsible for the development of robot traffic.
Robotic cars run throughout the autumn three days a week: between 13 pm and 3: 30 pm on Tuesday, 10 pm on Wednesday and 10 pm on Thursday.
Robotic cars stop at six stops along the route and take passengers on board.

Mokoma band bassist fell from the stands in the middle and was injured
The Mokoma band posted on their Facebook page about the unexpected situation in Tampere's PakkaRoom.
The Mokoma band's gig in Tampere's PakkaRoom took a dramatic turn on Saturday, when the band's bassist Santtu Huckabee fell from the stands in the middle of an appearance.
The situation occurred when the band was pulling the final piece of the evening.

Police monitor hunting in northern Karjala and Savo
The police department in eastern Finland carried out hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday with the Forest Service and the Finnish Game Centre in northern Karjala and Upper Saxony, the police department said on social media on Saturday.
The main focus of the surveillance was on the legality and authority of the hunt.
Each hunter was checked for a hunting card and a hunting permit was required on state lands.
In addition, the possession permits for hunting weapons were checked, as well as the permitted cartridge amounts of self-contained weapons used in the canal design.
According to the police, 112 hunters were checked during the surveillance, and only one hunter was met in connection with the surveillance, which lacked a required hunting permit.
The hunter was fined 12 days for unauthorized fishing.
Police also breathalysed 133 vehicle drivers, and two of them are suspected of driving under the influence.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic violations during the fine procedure, the police said.
To sum up, the hunters are very well adhering to the authorization of the hunt.
Many hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
One hunter said: "I have been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone has checked the permits."
The police department in eastern Finland will continue to monitor hunting in the autumn, together with other supervisory authorities.

Mykkänen leaves for Turkey to monitor the choice of Syrian quota refugees
Interior Minister Kai Mykkänen (IOC) will travel to Turkey in the coming days to monitor the choice of quota refugees coming to Finland.
Finland has decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps this year.
Selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year, with representatives from the Immigration Department, the Ministry of Employment and Business and the police involved.
The delegation is already conducting interviews in Turkey.
The UN refugee agency UNHCR first selects people who are particularly vulnerable.
In practice, it has meant people deemed to be in a particularly needy position in refugee camps, such as single families, the disabled and the sick, women and children.
More people are elected to the group of people coming to Finland than there are in the quota, as in practice some will not arrive for different reasons.
Mykkänen also meets with Turkish Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu and NGOs operating on the Syrian border.
Also on the way is the Chief of Staff of the Ministry of the Interior, Mr Salmi.
Talk of raising the quota
Finland has been taking quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees a year.
For a couple of years, the quota reached a maximum of 1,000 per year, but no agreement has since been reached in the government to raise it.
The Coalition has advocated raising the quota, but the last time the project has fallen to blue resistance.
He recently proposed gradually increasing the quota to between 1,500 and 2,000 people per year.
During this term of government, Mykkäse's visit will be the first by the interior minister on the ground to monitor the choice of quota refugees.
Previous interior ministers Petteri Orpo (IOC) and Paula Risikko (IOC) had time to move on to their new tasks before the visits were arranged.
Finland receives €10,000 in support from the EU for every particularly vulnerable refugee.
In any case, it was so important that it had to be killed.
"Obsessed with your body." What does that mean?
It is unacceptable that an area as important as internal security policy is outside Parliament's control and decision-making, and that democratic transparency does not apply.

Now you go to the fray - you do not know if you are crying or laughing anymore
Last Saturday, Karjalainen reported on a bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act.
The article gave the impression that the bill, as a matter of principle, prohibits the keeping of all animals that are not specifically permitted by ministry regulations as farm animals, pets or otherwise in connection with business activities.
So everything else is essentially prohibited except the animals mentioned in the regulation.
If the bill ends up in law, it means that we are rejecting the general principle in western democracies that the law specifically prohibits activities that endanger the safety or the good way of society.
As a matter of principle, we are now enacting a ban on all activities that are not specifically authorised by law or regulation.
The change will mean that nothing new can be tried, for example, in business, and nothing else will be done until the law or regulation that approves it has been passed.
The government's performance in the preparation of the law in general has been weak.
Now, if you go down the road that basically in Finland everything is prohibited, which is not specifically allowed, you no longer know whether you are crying or laughing.
I have no doubt that the Animal Welfare Act will require an update.
But the legislative project in this direction does not belong to democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but I wonder if it accepts such a "everything is prohibited, which is not allowed by law or regulation" procedure.
Hopefully there will be a sensible minister who will suspend the progress of such a legislative project.
The dot shows a key estimate, and the line shows uncertainty in the 95 percent reliability period.
The best possible answer would be a ticket - something that certainly happens in a particular place at a certain time.

Alexia's baby, 3, breaks sweet in Jeren's arms
In Karalahtie's family photo, a sweet three-month-old Alexia baby comes to the centre of attention.
Nanna Karalhti tells about the Aito nursery, which was set up in Kerava.
Sports entrepreneur Nanna Karalhti, 30, and ex jockey Jere Karalhti, 43, received a family addition in early July.
The couple's eldest son Jax turned 2 in May, while little Alexia is only a three-month-old baby.
Recently, Nanna Karalhti gave a stage camp with Martina Ajärvi to coaches in Marbella, Spain, which involved the entire Karalahden family.
Nanna posted a photo of the mood in Spain on Instagram showing the entire Karalahden family.
Children Jax and Alexia are in their parents' arms.
Attention is paid to the sweet breaking Alexia baby, who is resting on the arm of Jere's father.
Thankful for this.
Thankful for the goodness, for the forgiveness, for the generosity and joy of the people, writes Nanna Karalhti alongside the family potre.

On Saturday evening, disaster and emergency officials urged citizens to download their mobile phones before the storm and ensure that internet access works so that people can receive timely situation updates, according to local news agency Anadolu Ajansi.
People have been urged to stay at home and far from the windows and to move garden furniture away from the wind, for example.
Heavy rain is expected in Turkey and winds are expected to blow between 28 and 33 metres per second.
In Greece, red weather warning

Kimi Raikkonen summed up the reason for Mercedes' superiority compared to Ferrari
Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen was allowed to admit that Mercedes, the worst competitor, was too hard a pill in time for the Russian GP.
However, there is no reason for panic in the Ferrari camp to sink, the experienced driver estimates.
They just got quicker than us, but no huge thing is at stake.
Our car was the best in time all weekend so far, but they just got too fast, the fourth drive and the Mercedes swing clearly left with Sebastian Vettel.
Ferrari already had a difficult time in the last race in Singapore.
Raikkonen was asked what the equivalent of falling off the board of Mercedes is all about.
They seem to be going faster than us - it is as simple as that.
If I knew the reason for that, we would probably go at the same rate as them.
But I do not know any more than anyone else.
This is the only guesswork, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Ken knows why?
In time, a rare delicacy was seen for Sauber, the future stable of Raikkonen.
Charles Leclerc, who will replace Raikkonen next season at Ferrari, was seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also reached the final time trial session.
For the Swedish driver, the tenth starting place is the best in more than three years.
And although no fewer than five drivers failed to drive completely in the second driving session, the outcome was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging for Raikkonen?
Yes, if you compare where they were from early in the season, it is been a big step forward.
Next year, there will be a different story, so we will see.

That was it - Robert Helenius shot Erkan Teperin: "Robbe is back"
Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper's match at Stuttgart evening went ahead on a steady note.
The German was a more initiative side in the ring, but he did not get any proper hits.
Clearly more accessible, Helenius controlled the match with his hard sets, which found themselves well delivered.
Finn was also clearly in better physical shape than Teper.
The settlement eventually came in the eighth when Helenius knocked down Teper in his left straight.
The hit was so hard that the conman in front of the home audience was not even trying to get up on the carpet.
After the win was confirmed, Helenius was winding down quite moderately.
In the ring interview, he initially praised the good mood and opponent created by the audience.
Then, for a moment, he changed his tongue to Finnish.
Thank you to all the viewers and Finnish supporters.

Helenius was delighted immediately after the match.

Rescuers are searching for the trapped and also the deceased from the hardest-hit areas of the island of Sulawesi: the port city of Return and its neighbouring Donggala.
So far all the victims are from Palus, there is still no clarity about the situation in Donggala.
Hundreds of people are missing and approximately 540 have been badly injured.
There are still people in the collapsed buildings whom the rescuers have been unable to get out.
A hotel called Roa Roa in Palu, for example, has collapsed.
Rescuers say they have heard screams from people trapped in the rubble, but the lack of clearance equipment has delayed the start of the rescue effort.

The hesitant response and lengthy reflection of the Miss Finland finalist caused a laughing stock
A new Miss Finland is currently being selected for Billnäs in Helsinki.
During the interview round, every missifinalist was asked a question.

The hesitant response, especially from finalist number six Emilia Anttikoski, 23, prompted sweet, but benign laughs in the audience present.
The question to Anttikoski had come through Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wants to know what the latest book has been read by a missifinalist.
Anttikoski thought about her answer with a good spell before starting hesitantly.
Thank you for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The latest book I have read is..., "Anttikoski said, wondering.
The pause was met with laughter in the audience, until Anttikoski continued his response:
The last book I have read is...
Yes, I have read books at school!
Probably something related to economics.
So the last book I have read is someone in economics, "Anttikoski replied.
After his response, Anttikoski received a resounding round of applause from the audience with laughter.
Earlier on the mission tour, Anttikoski attracted attention because she did not want to pose in underwear because of her principles.

Status symbols do not attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney, who have analysed the issue, have outlined two species of "coolism" made up of slightly different characteristics: the generally attractive coolism and the opposite dissidence.
Attractively, according to the researchers' description, people had many socially desirable traits: they were outward-looking, friendly, harmonious and competent.
For the dissidents, there was a typical distance, independence, rebelliousness and crack.
They were hungry for experience and had little regard for the assessments of outsiders.
Both types were combined with good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of toughness is not cool for longer: high status in your teens does not necessarily lead to success later in life.

There is a hurricane hitting - weather warning screams red
During the weekend, southern Greece may have as much water as Finland's average over six months.
The Zorbas hurricane will hit Greece over the weekend.
Be prepared if you are staying in Peloponnesos, the Joonian Islands, Kyklaadi or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish embassy in Athens announces it on its Facebook page.
According to the major approach, the Greek air science service has issued a red weather warning for the regions.
The impending storm is also reported in a blog post from the weather service Foreca.
It says the toughest bout of the storm is up to 45 metres per second.
By comparison, the Kuisma storm, which has been in Finland since the beginning of the week, blew its hardest at just over 31 metres per second.
But according to the blog, the biggest concern of the Zorbas storm is not the wind, it is the heavy rain.
More than 300 millimetres of water could enter southern Greece over the weekend.
That equates to approximately half of Finland's annual rainfall.
The weather service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video of the storm developing on its Facebook page.
Earlier this week, the Zorbas storm has caused flooding in Tunisia and Libya.

Valtteri Bottas was shaking and biting adrenaline in Sochi - will he be a helper to Hamilton on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas was still shaking for dozens of minutes after his pole drive from the Russian GP when he was in front of the media.
The fine round left behind Mercedes star Lewis Hamilton and was certainly an important criticism of the Finnish player who has gathered this season.
Nice round.
I do not know what happened to Lewis when he left the round.
It feels good, I am still shaking a bit, "Bottas explained.
I have only been on pole once this year, in Austria (midsummer), so it is been quite a while.
This track has been good for me in the past and I got good rounds again.
It is not easy to overtake on the Sochi circuit, so leaving plays a particularly big role.
And of course Bottas was able to answer for swimming, whether he is pushing for victory tomorrow or whether he is facing the jeering of Hamilton, who is approaching the world title.
My starting point for the race is definitely that I am trying to win.
There can be no other goal when you leave the pole, "Bottas said.
But as a stayer, we are fighting for both championships.
Lewis's lead over Sebastian Vettel is pretty big and the difference is very big for me, so it should be kept in mind.
But we will see what happens, "Bottas added.
After the drive, Hamilton was genuinely delighted with the success of Bottas, and the Mercedes stable boss Toto Wolff had a taste.
Lewis had the intention of winning at Valtteri, but he did not manage a standing bend.
Valtteri knows he has to tear everything out of himself to beat Lewis.
And he was so charged that the adrenaline was biting out of the ears, Wolff spun.
Asked whether the stable would allow Bottas and Hamilton to drive roughly, Wolff replied with dodge.
We 'll be talking tomorrow morning and we will see how the race goes.
I thank God that he is a crook and not a death.

Kite-born Erno Kinnunen reached a rally at the Finnish Championship
The championship series of rally motoring ended rare times.
Hardly ever before, the brothers have ended up as champions of Finland at the same time.
Now, during the closing rally in the surroundings of the country, Eerik and Henrik St. Petersburg, who won the class of SM1 and Henrik SM2, did so.
The Kite-born Erno Kinnunen secured the best accomplishment of his career when the third place finish sealed him the Finnish championship from the SM4 class of double-bogey cars.
Kinnunen, who is competing in Honda Civic, and Dennis Badkelä, a mansion reader, started the contest with restraint because the starting points were clear: investment in the top group would guarantee the championship title.
In the darkness of Friday evening, the couple were forced to give a handicap when some of the additional lights were deceived in the second Test.

Syria demands US, France and Turkey withdraw troops
The Syrian foreign minister is calling on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Speaking at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem says foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
Muallem said foreign troops are in Syria fighting terrorism, and the war on terrorists is "almost over," he said.
In his U.N. address, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
But there is no end to the war that has been going on for seven years.
More than 360,000 people have died in the war.
On Friday, Chancellor Angela Merkel told Germany that a Syria meeting was planned for October, which would involve the presidents of France, Russia and Turkey.

Not quite Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched Supreme Court judge drama on TV
Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused him of harassment, got an extraordinary amount of people on the screens.
The Supreme Court judge's nomination drama, which is running at full capacity in the United States, attracted at least 20 million people to its televisions on Thursday.
At the time, Kavanaugh, who was appointed by Donald Trump and accused of harassment by California professor Blasey Ford, was before the Senate Judiciary Committee to tell his story.
According to preliminary results, the hearings were followed by six main channels, ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC, with a total of 20.4 million viewers.
They added that the consultation was followed by several million more online.
NBC reported that 6.8 million people watched the live show and CNN reported its record for the year with 8.2 million live broadcast starts.
CNN's figure will rise to more than 10 million, according to people who watched the broadcast via YouTube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also reached 8.0 million launches.
Digital start-ups are their own channels, TV ratings come from research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen will publish the final figures on Monday, but they will be soaring anyway.
Few reach 20 million
In the United States, more than 20 million viewers typically only attend sports matches, and the major Oscars and Grammy Awards in the entertainment world, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches and presidential debates in 2016.
Of course, there is a way to go for America's annual most-watched program, the National Football League finals match for the Super Bowl.
This year, the Super Bowl gathered about 103 million people on NBC for screens.
Last year, according to Nielsen, Trump's first speech to Congress was viewed by nearly 48 million people and just over 30 million people at the inauguration.
Top important thing
The Supreme Court judging panel is an extremely important case in the USA, as the posts are lifelong.
Trump was already able to appoint one new judge when Antonin Scalia passed away in early 2016 and Republicans succeeded in preventing then President Barack Obama from nominating a successor to him.
Another seat opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but on several issues he was the so-called "scales" language whose voice could resolve the nine-person court position.
She was a supporter of abortion rights and LGBT rights and settled in 2015, for example, for same-sex marriage rights throughout the federation.
Kavanaugh is far more conservative in his positions.
His election to the Supreme Court could lock the right to conservative supremacy for decades.

Children have the right to access their information to parents
Only parents of children under the age of 10 can see the health records of their children from the Kantas service.

Initially, of course, the situation of the Kantas service was even more worrying: parents were not even able to view the health records or prescriptions of the minuscule.
An interim correction was described in the autumn of 2016 for the under-10s.

In the US, FBI began retracting allegations of harassment against Kavanaugh
According to US media, the FBI is investigating allegations of harassment made by at least two women.
One of the women was appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this week.
Kavanaugh has denied accusations of alleged sexual harassment during his time studying.
Us President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The investigation must not take a week further.
According to the Washington Post, this is a criminal investigation into a more limited investigation, and it may not become public.

Aid agencies prepare to start work in Sulawesi, Indonesia - "It is the most urgent water"
The UN children's agency Unicef and other international aid agencies are ready to help on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to Kirsi Haru, head of information at Unicef in Finland.
Local authorities are leading the rescue effort, but the need for additional assistance is already evident at this stage.
UNICEF operates in almost all countries, and we also have sustained programmes in Indonesia.
Along with normal activity, Unicef always has full emergency response capacity, says Haru.
The first task now is to find people in the ruins, both survivors and the dead.
In the city of Sulawesi, rescue operations are underway, but the situation in the Donggala area is slightly further north.
There are still places where connectivity does not work.
The relief effort is difficult because the roads are also off, says Haru.
The buildings are often lighthearted in Sulawesi, so the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami is great.
Once the survivors have been found, they need shelter - first, for example, tents - and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
The first thing people can do most often is provide water cleaning stables, which Unicefi also has in stock.
Efforts are being made to repair the water systems as soon as possible, but in the event of an emergency, water is being transported to the first resort by trucks, for example.
In crisis situations, many children get rid of their parents.
The search for family members and the reunification of families is one part of Unicef's mission.
Food aid is organised, for example, by the World Food Programme (WFP), which is part of the UN.
In the early stages, previously raised funds will be used for emergency relief.
However, Unicef, among others, has already started raising money to help the victims of Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami.

Billionaire Elon Musk quit as Tesla chairman - fined $20 million for tweets
Elon Musk, founder of aerospace rockets and electric vehicle companies, avoids fraud charges by agreement with the US Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk quit his role as chairman of electric car company Tesla, agreeing to a $20 million fine.
Musk is stepping down as part of a deal he signed with America's securities regulator.
By agreeing, Musk will avoid fraud charges.
The US Securities Commission (SEC) threatened Musk for securities fraud because of tweets he sent in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing to pull the electric car company Tesla out of the stock market, prompting a rapid rise in the company's share price.
According to the agreement, Musk will not be allowed to chair Tesla for three years.
Moreover, Tesla must appoint a new "independent member" to its government and take two "independent directors" to its executive team.
Tesla must also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communications.
Musk is still allowed to continue as chief executive of Tesla.
In addition to Musk's personal fines of $20 million, the Tesla company will also have to pay 20 million equivalent fines to the financial watchdog.
The tweets misled investors
According to the SEC, Musk's tweets misled investors and Tesla shareholders.
Musk claimed he would have secured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange as a private equity company.
According to tweets from the billionaire, the company would have been purchased off the stock exchange for $420 a share.
Tesla's share price rose more than 10 per cent in the 24 hours after the tweets, but fell later.
According to the SEC, Musk's claims had no basis whatsoever.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated the funding he claimed.
He also had not discussed a retreat from the stock exchange with the rest of the management team or the company's board.
On Friday this week, the rate dropped by 14 per cent when the SEC, the securities watchdog, announced the fraud charge.
Agreeing to the news is expected to strengthen the company's rate again.
