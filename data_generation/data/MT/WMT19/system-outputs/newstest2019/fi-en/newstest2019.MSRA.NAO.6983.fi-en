Eemeli Kouki led Hurricane to home victory in the opening - Savo Volley wins second
Hurricane Loimaa, who had been in men's volleyball medals seven times in a row, started the season 2018-19 with a home victory when Raision Loimu fell 3-0 on Saturday.
General player Eemeli Kouki, who returned to Finland from Romania, was the most effective hurricane with 22 points.
There were some tunes abroad, but they didn't happen, and then there was a call from Loimaa.
Quite quickly things were agreed, Kouki said.
Tomi Rumpunen, who played in Loimu like Kouki, supported Kouki with 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was Samuli Kaislasalo, a national team chipper playing on a match-by-match contract, with 17 points.
The victory of the opening game is always important.
Many players had experience from the other side as well, and that brought extra extras to the game.
Our game is not yet ready, but extending the medal streak is, of course, the goal, Kouki said.
Määttänen Savo Volley's most efficient
Miro Määttänen was the most efficient Savo Volley with 18 points when the team knocked down the Ducks in Vantaa 3-0.
Our game was volatile, especially on the offensive end, but luckily we squeezed the victory.
I certainly didn't have any conscious different charge when I played against my former team, "Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in Vieremä Volleyball 3-series in 2000-01, scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was satisfied with many things.
The hall was small, that is, the atmosphere in the ceiling all the time.
A good feeling remained from the home opening.
Miro was a good guy, Herring also played a good game, "Tuovinen said.
Siltala's previous season in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver in Pielavesi Sammo when Tuovinen was head coach even then.
Thiago Maciel was the Ducks "most effective with 14 points.
Mikkonen again star of Akaa-Volley
Joni Mikkonen, who won the league scoring list in 2012-13, has started this season strongly as well.
The chipper scored 25 points when Akaa-Volley took his opening win of the season after knocking down the Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has started quite well for itself.
Today, of course, we were close to defeat, as we were losing 17-21 in the fourth period.
A batch victory was excavated from somewhere, and the fifth instalment came at the same time, Mikkonen said.
The most effective of the Tigers, who were still in the finals a few seasons ago, was Edvarts Buivids, a chipper who scored 28 points.
The compatriot Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs supported by 17 points.
There was almost no grip on a friend's chipper, Mikkonen praised.
- Live worry boy, this is not execution but teaching.
Finland ranks number one in the world in terms of human capital
Finland leads the world in the comparison of human capital, says the scientific journal Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was number one in the statistics.
In 2016, the top five was almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later the Netherlands ranked one higher and Taiwan was found on the list instead of Canada.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan ranked worst in the comparison.
Human capital is measured in terms of the population's level of education, access to education, skills and health.
The World Bank has linked human capital to economic growth.

Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico in check, local game ended goal-free
Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois stretched to brilliant rejections, and the local game of Madrid teams ended in a goal-free draw late on Saturday in the Spanish Football League.
From Atletico Madrid, Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were closest to goal, but Belgian keeper Courtois had time to fight.
Courtois played three seasons on loan at Atletico when he was a Chelsea player.
Early in the week, Fifa, the International Football Federation, selected him as the goalkeeper of the year.
In real terms, Gareth Bale got the best finish, but his shot was directed past the goal at the end of the opening half.

The right to abortion is now being attacked in the United States - A powerful documentary explains why
The US Senate is currently trying to determine whether Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee nominated by President Donald Trump, could be selected as one of the nine members of the Supreme Court.
In the Republican Party, many hope that Kavanaugh's decisive vote will overturn the decision known as Roe v. Wade, which made abortion legal in the USA in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary Reversing Roe - The United States and abortion rights show how the current situation has come about over the years.
As incredible as it seems, the subject is also topical in Finland.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (sin) has done publicity work against safe abortion and has received varying degrees of support from the vast majority of MPs in our country.
At the beginning of the powerful documentary, gynaecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has remained the only doctor performing abortions in the state of Missouri due to tightening laws, will be met.
The clinic's armed guard says he defends U.S. religious freedom.
News videos remind us of the deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
Let's move to a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, a consortium of Lutheran church men guided women to reliable abortion doctors.
The arguments of the pastor interviewed are good, but in fact they are not even needed, a photograph of a woman who has died from a self-abortion is enough.
The number of deaths in the USA was around 5,000 per year.
The Republican Party, in particular, defended the legalisation of abortions.
Back in 1967 in California, the Abortion Rights Act was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, it was Reagan, in his presidential campaign in 1980, who began to epochally confuse religion with politics in order to catch up with voters.
His abortion position was also reversed by his successor, George Bush senior.
And Donald Trump did the same.
The document goes to the heart of the matter in search of the root cause of the politicisation of the abortion issue.
When pro-apartheid religious organizations were denied tax exemption, they became politically active.
Abortion was chosen as the stick horse.
Religion has brought exceptional nodes to politics.
At the time of writing, the US is in a situation where the President, who boasted of his oral harassment but grabbed the voices of the religious right on his abortion position, has chosen Kavanaugh, who is now accused by several women of sexual harassment, as a candidate for the Supreme Court.
Kavanaugh can gain the power based on balance language status to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.

The Israeli army shot seven Palestinians, including two children - large demonstrations at the border
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months as Israel has fired on demonstrators in the border zone.
On Friday, seven Palestinians were shot by Israeli soldiers in the Gaza border zone, the Palestinian Ministry of Health says.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, two children are among the dead: boys aged 12 and 14.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
Of these, 89 were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli military has confirmed that it opened fire and carried out an air strike on the border zone as demonstrators threw stones and explosives at Israeli forces.
The army says it has started using force so that demonstrators do not break down or aspire to the other side of the border fence.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in Gaza protests since March, when Palestinians began weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, 12 000 people are wounded.
Demonstrators demanded access for Palestinian families to areas Palestinians were forced to leave when the state of Israel was founded in 1948.
One Israeli soldier has been killed by a Palestinian sniper.
Explosives dropped with kites and helium balls from the Palestinian side have ignited wooded areas and farmland in Israel.

Teemu Pukki acquired a penalty kick - couldn't shoot himself
Wigan's topper Chey Dunkley appeared to have knocked him down with a tackle from behind in the penalty area.
Referee Gavin Ward allowed the game to continue.
According to his interpretation, the tackle was clean.
Teemu Pukki could not believe his eyes.
I think the situation will be troubled by referee Ward, who sentenced Norwich to a penalty kick in the 85th minute when Pukki was overthrown.
Ward showed a penalty spot, and Mario Vrancic shook a 1-0 winning goal.

Paedophile help service was immediately filled with bookings - in Finland about 40 000 people experience interest in children
It is estimated that 2% of men and a small proportion of women experience at least some sexual interest in pre-teenagers.
In Finland, this means around 40 000 people.
Until now, it has been difficult for those who are sexually interested in children or young people to get help.
SeriE, a joint project between the Criminal Care Foundation and Sexpo, trains professionals to meet paedophiles as clients and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, Sexpossa, which offers advice and therapy, started to receive an e-mail flood and appointments were booked very quickly, "says Yle.
However, these are promised to be released during the autumn.
The sexual preference for children is a source of shame for many.

Korean leaders or Congolese gynaecologist?
US President Donald Trump as winner of the Nobel Peace Prize - the idea may sound odd suddenly, but Trump is one of the biggest favourites to receive the prize based on betting odds.
The background is Trump's role in getting North Korea to commit to nuclear disarmament, at least at the level of rhetoric.
The biggest favourites to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, based on the odds, are South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have already met three times this year and promised to seek a peace agreement between their two countries.
The warming between the two Koreas is considerable, as relations were still good last year.
Yet rewarding Kim, who has been threatened with nuclear weapons for years and is leading his country with an iron grip, would undoubtedly also provoke criticism.
The Nobel Prize winners will be announced from Monday, and Friday will be the most prominent, the Peace Prize.
If the prize is not given to those involved in diplomacy on the Korean Peninsula, Denis Mukwege, a Congolese doctor, will be one of the top candidates.
A respected gynaecologist has treated thousands of women who have been victims of mass rape in his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has become a leading expert in his field in the world.
Through his work, Mukwege has drawn attention to sexual violence, a gruesome by-product of many conflicts.
The UN refugee agency, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been considered a strong candidate.
The Nobel Committee has reported that there are 331 nominees for the prize this year.
The names of the candidates will not be made public.
Trump himself would not mind receiving the Nobel Prize.
In May, a reporter asked him at the White House if he thought he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it myself, "Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, the President continued, referring to the North Korea negotiations.
However, there are facts that make Trump's Nobel Prize unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides on the award, has often paid tribute to individuals and organizations representing liberal democracy and a multipolar world order - exactly the kind of international cooperation Trump has been seen as an opponent of.
In the 21st century, the prize has been awarded to three US politicians, all of whom have been democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
So rewarding Trump would require an ideological U-turn from the Nobel committee.

Fire report in tunnel: Motorists behaved like lemmings and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos on number one in Lohja took place on 8 September.
Due to the announcement, traffic in the tunnel area was cut off towards both Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that there was a system failure, the fire brigade tried to bring traffic to normal.
However, it did not succeed very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Centre said it cannot be opened because there are motorists on the road even in shock and they drive how it hurts, "off-duty fire officer Pasi Kääriäinen told the STT at the time.
At that time, the motorway was even driven in the wrong direction after just a moment of waiting.
When the first one starts working against the traffic rules, a few others often follow suit, Tapio Heiskanen, the contact manager for traffic safety, is surprised.
According to traffic rules, motorways and tunnels must not stop except for compelling reasons.
Road safety reminds us that, in exceptional circumstances, traffic cannot be put at risk by hasty solutions.
Emergency vehicles must always be allowed to travel as easily as possible.
In particular, driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is prohibited, as is making a u-turn and cancelling.
The same bans apply in tunnels, where headlights must always be switched on.
Stopping for no compelling reason is also prohibited, as is parking, of course.
Recently, there have even been cases where a driver has stopped in a tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this activity, "Heiskanen says in the Traffic Safety Bulletin.

Lynx fans would have liked to continue their celebrations even though the ship was caught at the bottom of the lake
Ilves fans transported by the inland waterway ship M / S Tampere would have liked to stay on board to continue their victory celebrations even though the ship had been caught in the bottom of the lake from its bow, "says Juho Syrjä, the ship's master at the time of the incident.
M / S Tampere, which was travelling from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drifted off its route late on Saturday evening and was caught in the bottom of its bow in Vanajavesi, Akaa.
The 19 passengers and five crew members aboard the ship were evacuated to the mainland at night.
Nobody was injured in the haver.
Lynx fans would have liked to continue their celebrations on board until the morning, but of course it made more sense to send them home by fire brigade and bus, "Syrjä said to STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna following the Ilves-HPK match, which ended with Ilves "4-3 victory.
According to the discrimination, Saturday's blood was due to the fact that the water level in Vanajavesi was about half a metre lower than normal.
According to Syrjä, navigation was also made more difficult by the fact that the nearest fairway sign was covered with log droppings, which meant that its reflectors were not normally visible on the dark autumn bridge.
No more notable collision
The Haveri took place on the west side of the narrow Deity Strait shortly after the shipping route had crossed the Tampere-Helsinki motorway bridge.
According to Syrjä, there was no greater drama involved, as the speed of the vessel was very low at the time of the incident and hitting the bottom did not cause a more significant collision.
According to the discrimination, being caught at the bottom has not caused any leaks or depressions on the ship and the ship's cruises are expected to continue as normal.
The diver went to inspect the condition of the ship on Saturday morning before the ship started to be towed off the shoal.
As a precaution, we are still going to the shipyard to check that no damage was caused, "Syrjä says.
Syrjä believes that M / S Tampere's next cruise, booked next weekend, can be handled as agreed.
The cruise season of the ship will continue until Independence Day, he said.
No use for ambulances
The emergency services were alerted to the incident on Saturday evening just after half past twelve.

Trump's nominee for judge accused of harassment and drunkenness may miss out on top job
Brett Kavanaugh, who has been presented as a judge of the US Supreme Court, may well not hold the post he is seeking, "says Mika Aaltola, Programme Director at the Foreign Policy Institute.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour during his studies.
According to Aaltola, the suspicions have put so much political pressure on the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up putting someone else in office.
In the United States, it has occasionally happened in the past that the President's nominee for Supreme Court justice has aroused a great deal of controversy.
In this case, the candidate for the judge has usually withdrawn himself, "says Aaltola.
This has allowed the President to keep his face.
Appointment would rain on Democrats' lard
The U.S. Supreme Court seeks to be above politics, but at least in Kavanaugh's case, the election of a new judge has become a politically very delicate process.
According to Aaltola, if Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision is likely to rain on the Democratic Party in the upcoming mid-term elections to Congress.
It would boost turnout among young people and women, who would be more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, appointing a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for Republicans.
The opportunity for the appointment does not coincide with every presidential term, as Supreme Court judges in the United States are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request between the ages of 70 and 80.
Some Republicans also hesitate to nominate
Judicial nominees for the Supreme Court of the United States are normally subject to a background study, Aaltola says.
Although Trump has only set a one-week deadline for further investigation by the FBI, according to Aaltola, it can still bring out something essential.
Yes, it may bring.
Rarely is there smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, what is certain is that Kavanaugh's suitability or unsuitability for office will still be the subject of lively debate before the Senate makes its decision.
Republicans have a majority of 51 to 49 votes in the Senate, but at least two female Republican senators are thought to be sceptical about Kavanaugh's nomination.
The most embarrassing thing would be for the nomination to be put to the vote and for Republicans to lose.

Woman identified Salisbury suspect as military intelligence agent
A Russian woman has told the BBC that she identifies a Russian man suspected of poisoning in Salisbury as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service.
On the basis of the photographs, the woman said that this was a military enquiry by Anatoly Tshepiga, who works for the GRU.
Bellingcat, the online community, and Insider Russia, the Russian community, said earlier that they had uncovered one of the two men suspected of poisoning as Chepiga.
Earlier they said they had found evidence that the men's current identities were covert identities.
The BBC team travelled to the Far East to a village near the Russian-Chinese border where the Tshepiga grew up.
A woman living in the village identified the young Tshepiga from the pictures released by Bellingcat.
He identified the same man in pictures of British police featuring a man now calling himself Ruslan Boshirov.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with the Novichok nerve agent in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Chepiga has been awarded, among other things, the Order of the Hero of Russia in 2014.
Russia still denies the suspected GRU connection.
The men suspected of poisoning said earlier in September in an interview with Russian TV that they had been tourists in Salisbury.

Elderly people as throwing bags in sote reform
There is now a living example of what the Sipilä government's restriction on change in the grip reform means in practice.
My birthplace Vaala's sote services are provided by Oulunkaaren kuntayhtymä, whose former Regional Director of Attendo has been elected as Health Service Director in 2016.
Local government leaders warn the council against a change limiter.
If sote expenditure now rises, municipal state aid will be cut in the future.
The decision-makers in the centre of the municipality were frightened, and the majority of them are prepared for a major restructuring of care for the elderly, which would put an end to institutional care in the wards of the health centre and a small unit for memory illnesses.
Home care would be increased, which means that, over long distances in Vaala, elderly people living in remote villages would be uprooted next to the health centre for "home" care.
Attendo relied on the municipality to pay it customers.
The left of the election did not swallow poor preparation, but organised a good public event with a large number of relatives, local nurses and also delegates from other parties.
I presented how the municipality of Vaala already cares for the elderly most at home in the whole of North Ostrobothnia.
Carina Läntinen, a councillor from the neighboring municipality, was also present.
The local newspaper made a big story about the event, and it again put the draftsmen of the Oulu Arc on their back feet.
Sote draftsmen do not write in any papers that Attendo has built a new care home in Vaala, which is now waiting empty for residents.
There are no other service providers.
The preparers only talk about the voucher, but do not say what level of care it will provide or what staff structure Attendo will provide for the elderly until hospice care.
Without a nurse?
Namely, the health centre's facilities are being closed because there is no doctor's night call.
Attendo will also rely on doctors from the Vaala Health Centre.
The example of the election shows how centrist officials run delegates with incomplete information and delegates are put back against the wall with a change limiter.
In this way, the Centre Party will empty the inhabitants of Vaala, because who will stay there unsafe voluntarily if there is an opportunity to move away.
Was there one electoral phrase in the centre that the whole country is considered inhabited?

Turkish President Erdogan opened the Grand Mosque in Cologne
In the German city of Cologne, thousands of people protested when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is visiting the country, opened one of the largest mosques in Europe.
Several hundred people had gathered on the banks of the Rhine River since the morning.
Erdogan you are not welcome, read on the signs of the demonstrators, and the slogans condemned fascism.
Several demonstrations have taken place during Erdogan's visit, which began on Thursday, and security measures have been strict.
In Cologne, around 10 000 people were expected to take to the streets beforehand to protest, including the human rights situation in Turkey.
Supporters of Erdogan had also gathered near the Grand Mosque.
However, police had cordoned off a large area around the mosque for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised the success of his visit to Germany and estimated that it had strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel vowed Friday to rebuild relations between the two countries, which have deteriorated significantly since Turkey's 2016 coup attempt.
However, Mrs Merkel stressed that there were deep differences between the two countries, including on human rights issues.
Criticism surrounds the visit
Both Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker and North Rhine-Westphalia Prime Minister Armin Laschet cancelled their attendance at the opening ceremony as criticism of Erdogan's visit intensified.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, said he had come to a demonstration against Erdogan from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who cannot take to the streets in Turkey.
They have been arrested, killed and subjugated.
For Erdogan, anything that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
At the final leg of Erdogan's trip to Germany in North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant proportion of the population is of Turkish origin.

In Slovakia, three charged with murdering a journalist
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
On Friday, the prosecutor said that three people were accused of the February murder of Kuciak and his betrothed, as well as other crimes.
Earlier this week, eight people were arrested by the police in the investigation into the murder, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot in February with his fiancée in his home in Bratislava.
He had investigated the links between politicians and the Italian mafia.
Police have suspected the murders are linked to Kuciak's inquiries.
The case and Kuciak's published article have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.

Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Journalist Arto Nyberg will interview Vesa Heilala live today in his upcoming discussion programme.
Vesa is in the studio to talk about her upcoming space trip, which she booked from Virgin Galactica back in 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000, which required a bank loan to pay.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have visited space a long time ago.
However, the departure date has been postponed year on year.
It now seems that, after an unlucky test flight in 2014, which also claimed lives, things are fair.
If all goes well, commercial flights will still start this year, or at the latest next year.
Vesa's flight number is 300, which means that her trip takes place about a year from her first departure.
The flight takes 2.5 hours and we are in a weightless state for 5 minutes at 100 km, "says the Finnish astronaut on his website.
At the same address, he also gives background to his longing for space.

Manchester City continued their loss-free run in the Premier League when they toppled Brighton 2-0 on their home field on Saturday.
Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero were the guarantors of the reigning champion team's sixth victory of the season.
Sterling was allowed to steer his fourth hit of the season from close range to an empty goal when Leroy Sané found him in the 30th minute with a Brighton goal from the taCatholic.
Agüero raised his own March balance to five when he sawed the Brighton defence to pieces with Sterling in the 65th minute of play.
The Argentine was able to place the 2-0 final readings at the penalty spot easily.

Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkönen and was amazed at Ferrari: "Losing a very important driver"
In an interview with the Swiss newspaper Blick, Mersu's British driver was asked whether he believed that Kimi Räikkönen's release from Ferrari would help Hamilton for the rest of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second driver Sebastian Vettel by 40 points in the World Cup standings.
Just under three weeks ago Ferrari told that Räikkönen would not continue in the stable next season and at the same time Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Hamilton does not, of course, believe that Räikkönen would hit the gloves on the counter.
I don't think Kimi will change in the remaining Games.
He is an exceptional professional - a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favourites and I am convinced Ferrari will lose a very important driver.

UEFA Junior Championship battle became a complete farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players
The top tier of football boys will end on Saturday, when the final round of the season will be played.
Before the start of the round at 1 p.m., the starting points for the championship battle were clear: FC Lahti Academy has practically enough points against Vasa IFK.
In order for the situation to turn around in the last round, Ilves, the second in the championship battle, must win the PK-35 and hope for the Lahti defeat.
However, the Lahti championship was confirmed in practice even before the starting whistle, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one less Vaasa, the match could not have started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
During the break, Lahti led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the division of the Vaasa players is that the team has played partly the same players in the Finnish A-Junior Championship series, the P20 series, and men's Pool C.
Vasa IFK has played in Kakkonen practically all season against relegation.
In the closing round of Kakkonen on Saturday Vasa IFK will be forced to win JBK in a guest match and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose its own guest match against KuFu in Tovala, Siilinjärvi.

Serena Williams is startled by a video in which she sings topless - campaigning for awareness of breast cancer
Tennis superstar Serena Williams shrugs off again.
She is now campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by posting a video on her Instagram account in which she sings only her hands in front of her breasts, according to AFP news agency.
The song is the 1991 hit I Touch Myself by The Divinyls in Australia.
In the video, Williams supports the activities of the Australian Breast Cancer Association.
"I recorded The Divinyls' global hit to remind women to do regular self-help [breast] checks," Williams writes in her Instagram post.
And yes, this put me in a discomfort zone, but I wanted to do it because the subject affects all women regardless of skin colour all over the world.
Early detection is everything a and o - it frightens many lives.
The Divinyls song is co-written by Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, made in honour of Chrissy Amphlett.
"She passed away from breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first," Williams says.
The video has now been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was published early Sunday morning.
The comments in the video praise Williams for her courage.
Williams opted out of the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
The background is the uproar at the US Open three weeks ago.
Williams would come to the head judge of the match and, among other things, claimed that much more drastic behaviour is accepted from men than from female players.
The Statute of the ESCB contains precise rules for calculating the amounts on the basis of which the final distribution of profits to the ECB's shareholders is determined.

Is it worth going to work tomorrow with a little flu?
Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is at its hottest.
Many scars whether or not to stay at home.
However, it is worth considering whether others should go and infect, as the disease can be contagious even if their own symptoms are small.
Sometimes flu symptoms strike suddenly, sometimes they appear creeping.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your own symptoms seem small, according to the Prevention publication.
So is it worth staying at home?
According to Prevention, the flu is contagious even when the person himself has no symptoms.
The virus is transmitted one day before symptoms begin and then from five days to a week.
Children may infect the disease for longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you shouldn't be at school or at work.
You can return to work when the cough subsides and there is no fever anymore, says Gregory Poland, a professor of medicine.
Training should also be avoided.
Too fast a return to the hall slows down recovery.
In addition, remember to wash your hands, mower your handkerchief and throw the rag papers in the bin.
Sore to move, however?
If you have to leave your home sick, consider using a protective mask.
The mask does not control viruses, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
Then your fingers will not be put in your nose or mouth, Poland says.
Sneezing is also limited to the mask.
How, then, can infection be avoided?
The best way is still to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, the latter is difficult to avoid.
In the United States, for example, the average person touches his eyes, nose or mouth every 15 to 30 seconds, Poland warns.

New Miss Finland repeats mission tradition: "My husband is a hockey player"
Ice hockey players and misses are often associated.
This was also the case with Alina Voronkova, 23.
Miss Finland's crown of 2018 has been awarded to Alina Voronkova from Pertunmaa.
The beauty now lives in Lahti, where she moved at the age of 15.
Alina's mother is Ingrian and her father is Russian.
From the father's Russianism Voronkova was bullied at school.
Mother and father moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied because of my Russianism.
In Pertunmaa I had no friends at all, "Alina says at the announcement of the semi-finalists of the Miss Finland competition.
After secondary school, Alina decided to start from a clean table and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon the mission beauty found new friends and everyday life started rolling as hoped.
At the age of 15, you think you're an adult, but in retrospect I really wasn't.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner Joonas Hurr, who is familiar from the Pelicans ranks.
After a career in the Finnish league, a hockey player has played abroad, such as in Sweden and China.
In 2009 he was in the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Championships.
In the early days of dating, the couple lived almost a year away, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I were to get into the winning trio and have a career with it, then I do not want to believe that it would have any impact on our relationship.
Even if we have to live separately, we have good confidence and the good thing about the distance is that the initial spark remains over the whole time, Alina smiled in May.

Almost everyone is concerned about the resilience of the planet.
Yet there is little desire to give up.
Sustainable alternatives to continued growth are being sought, but even the theory of moderate economics runs into major problems.
Over a few generations, sustained economic growth has brought ordinary people, especially in the northern hemisphere, a standard of living that could only be dreamed of in the past.
However, the long-term overhang of the earth's carrying capacity and climate change are causing this bedrock of the market economy to falter dangerously.

An important point for IFK Mariehamn - Interi's coach regretted the mistake
IFK Mariehamn's Simon Silverholt's equalising goal against Interior brought the team an important point in the men's football league on Saturday.
Silverholt finished leveling the match that ended with 1-1 readings in the 78th minute.
Silvelholt got through from the right side and luckily lifted the ball over goalkeeper Henrik Moisander.
With the guest draw, Mariehamn made the difference to the Turku Ball Club, which is present in the league.
An important goal and a valuable point, summed up by Mariehamn head coach Peter Lundberg.
Lundberg noted, however, that the team did not spark the kind of battle he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes in the opening period, but luckily the Turku goal brought us more strongly into the game.
According to John Allen, head coach of the home team Interi, the game was under control, but scoring goals again caused pain.

Lehterä showed his underpower skills, the place of play is not yet certain
Jori Lehterä's strong underpower play emerged when his NHL club, the Philadelphia Flyers, played their last training match before the start of the season.
Philadelphia beat Boston 4-1, and Lehterä fed Michael Raffl twice to score goals.
In recent days, Lehterä has been on display because of suspicions of drugs.
MTV reported on Wednesday that Lehterä is one of 23 suspects in drug sales, where some are suspected of drug use and some, for example, of sales.
Lehterä has denied that he has committed a crime.
The club and the player have discussed the subject, and the NHL is investigating the incident.
Sam Carchidi, a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter who closely follows the Flyers, estimated after the match that Lehterä is part of a group of six attackers, five of whom will get a place on the NHL team.
Lehterä was excellent in the training match, according to Carchid.
In the second period Lehterä fought the puck for himself by underpower, pulled the defenseman and fed Raffl, who was waiting in front of the goal, into the open place.
For the second time, the duo's cooperation brought a goal right at the end of the match.
The Flyers will start the NHL season on October 4 with a guest match against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defenseman Urho Vaakanainen is waiting for the team's coaching management to decide whether to join the NHL team.
I thought the training camp was good.
I did my best and I can be proud of that.
Now the coaches decide whether I get to play.
I believe I am ready for the NHL, Vaakanainen said in an interview published on Boston's Twitter account.
Vaakanainen, who learned his puck in the river boys, played against Philadelphia for 19.31 minutes.
With Boston's goal Tuukka Rask surrendered four times and rejected 20 times.
Fly-backed defenseman Vili Saarijärvi scored a 1-0 goal for Detroit on the power play as the team toppled Toronto 5-1.

Fresh picture shows change: The world's strongest man lost dozens of kilograms
Eddie Hall, crowned the strongest man in the world in 2017, is undergoing a striking transformation.
British Eddie Hall hunted for the title of the world's strongest man for a long time and with determination.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 calories of food a day and weighed up to 200 kilograms, according to the Mirror.
Shirts were of size 5XL.
Hall admitted before winning the title that he was doing damage to his body.
The human body has not been created to be this size, Hall said.
The British hunted for victory in the world's strongest man race by all means and the man with a family promised to end his career if he got the title.
Hall did not want his children to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise and was no longer seen at the 2018 World's Strongest Man Games in April.
Recently, Hall posted a photo on Instagram showing her posing in a much slimmer condition than her active career.
Hall writes that his current weight is 169.5 pounds.
Hall wrote that he now trains five times a week aerobically.
The programme includes boxing, cycling and swimming.
In addition, Hall does four workouts a week in the gym.

Restaurant ship M / S Tampere ran aground in Pyhäjärvi - "Sturdy on the rocks"
The inland waterway ship M / S Tampere ran aground late on Friday evening in Akaa, Pyhäjärvi.
The emergency services were alerted to a water traffic accident on Friday evening after half past twelve.
The 30-metre-long vessel M / S Tampere has run aground, and is firmly attached to its bow on a rock, described fire-fighter Matti Willman.
There were 19 passengers and five crew members on board.
According to the Rescue Department, personal injury was avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland from the ship.
Now they are being moved by bus to Tampere, "said Jari Nieminen, Head of Emergency Services at STT after one o'clock at night.
Ambulances were alerted to the port of Viiala to receive evacuated passengers.
The ship, which travelled from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, had for some reason drifted off its route west of the narrow Jumusensalmi.
The police are investigating the cause of the events.
Daily firefighter Matti Willman told earlier in the evening that conditions on the lake are difficult due to darkness and quite strong wind.
According to the Rescue Department, the fate of the ship is unclear.
Apparently the ship is not leaking.
After the evacuation operation, divers will start checking what the situation is at the bottom there.
Built in 1957, M / S Tampere is now an inland waterway vessel operating as a restaurant ship with a maximum number of 180 passengers.
There is also a meeting room for private use.
According to the ship's website, the cruiser has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-managers demand unpaid fees from Robert Helenius
Boxer Robert Helenius's evening match against Erkan Teperi is overshadowed by a money dispute.
Ilta-Sanomat reported today on a summons application filed by boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and deputy judge Jussi Kokkila, in which Helen is charged a total of over EUR 80 000 in unpaid manager fees, including interest on late payments.
According to the summons application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helen from 15 April 2014 to 30 January 2015.
We have tried to mediate, but there is no alternative.
There has been a clear mandate here, and a great deal of work has been done, "Kokkila says to Ilta-Sanomat.
The current manager of Helenius, Markus Sundman, sent a reply to the Evening Journal explaining the boxer's view of the events.
Helenius denies that he is obliged to pay the required amount.
According to the reply, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services to Helenius in a difficult financial situation and promised that they would be able to organise matches and sponsorship income for him.
It had been verbally agreed that Helenius would only be obliged to pay percentages of his matches.
There were repeated assurances that Helenius did not have to pay anything, only to receive the income they arranged.
This is also normal and the only practice in the management of professional athletes.
Paid work has never been agreed and would also have been absurd in Helenius's situation, Sundman explains in his message.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
According to the reply, Helenius would have liked to agree on the distribution of income in writing from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman did not produce a draft until the end of 2014.
For his part, he said that the proposal was poor and broke off cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius never once had contact with Kokkila and Helminen.
A year after the end of the cooperation, Helenius had been assigned an "unidentified but substantial" bill for the manager's work.
This year, the same allegations have been made.
Helenius considers the aftermath of Helminen and Kokkila cowardly, the response states.
Helenius faces the Boxing Federation today in Stuttgart, Erkan Teperi, the seventh on the IBF heavyweight challenger list.

A heartfelt man and a good journalist
Entertainer and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the late radio presenter and journalist Erkki Pälli for decades.
Erkki Pälli, a long-term radio presenter and journalist, died at the age of 83 of incurable liver cancer.
The presenter's death announcement was published in Sunday's Helsingin Sanomat.
The announcement reports that Pälli died on 3 September.
Pälli reported a serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen at the time by Ile Vainio, who was saddened by knowledge of his acquaintance's fate.
He said goodbye on Facebook earlier, as it were, "says Ile Vainio.
Vainio considers Erkki Pälli to be a multi-talented talent who became a great journalist.
He remembers that Pälli was a liked person with quick glimpses and fun things.
I got to know Erk as a little boy when I first visited Finnrecord at the age of 12 and started there as a warehouse man.
We got to know Erk then.
He was then a spokesman for Finnrecord and in various positions, "Ile Vainio recalls.
When I proceeded to make records as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Pälli was a standard journalist at all parties to do stuff about artists.
He was always knowledgeable and I saw how big a fire he had on entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got straight into the skin of his interviewees.
He was a heartfelt man and a good journalist.
Many people became familiar with him as a respected Yle radio presenter, but he also wrote brilliant newspaper articles.
Erkki interviewed me several times as well.
He was good at speaking, Vainio praises.
Over the decades, Pälli worked not only as a journalist, but also in the Fazer record label with Toivo Kärki.
He was a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loiri's records.
Pälli's greatest passion, however, was radio work, where he had an original style.
He worked on radio since the 1960s, and he became familiar to numerous listeners in the Yle ether.
Pälli retired in 1998.

Dozens of bodies lie in the backyard of a hospital in the town of Palun on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Only one building separates them from the area where injured survivors have been assembled to assess injuries and the need for treatment.
Patients are also being treated outdoors for aftershocks.
One of those who moved around the hospital area was Baharuddin, a 52-year-old returnee who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.

It is known that there were around 560 prisoners, so there are possibly around 300 fugitives.

According to the newspaper, inmates became enraged and set fire to the prison after guards banned them from going in search of their relatives affected by the earthquake and tsunami.

Rain sweeps over Finland at night
A long area of rain will spread across the country from the west on Sunday night, according to the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
Rain mostly comes as water, but frost or snow is expected in central and northern Lapland.
The frosty frosts of the previous night are not going to happen again because temperatures remain higher under cloud cover.
A cloudier night keeps the lowest temperatures pretty effectively in check.
You can visit the West momentarily on the frosty side, "said Ville Ilkka, a meteorologist on duty.
On Sunday, the rainfall area will give way to the east during the morning.
In the south and west it is sunny or semi-cloudy.
In the afternoon, temperatures move up to the height of Oulu around 10-13 degrees Celsius.

Wind and wave warnings are in effect in sea areas.
No actual autumn storms are expected for the next few days, but otherwise there will be typically variable weather in the autumn.

Alina was often told that when she is so pretty that she should start to miss.
But he announced that he wanted to be a radio presenter.
Only later did Alina get excited about beauty contests.
The parents' wish was for Alina to go to university before taking part in the Miss Finland competition.
That is what happened, and in the end Alina still wanted to do a candy degree before the mission games.
We already asked last year why he was not taking part, but he wanted to finish it.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because it is a healthy example for young people and adults.
He sports a lot and eats healthily.
And Alina likes to be on display, it shows.
Alina's boyfriend Joonas Hurri is playing ice hockey in Japan and couldn't get to Finland to encourage his love in the finals.
Alina's parents believe the young people's relationship will last a mission year.
Yes, that is the intention!
The parents hoped that the daughter would soon be able to visit.
There has now been such a long break in visits due to mission hurries.
It is already disappointing, even though messages have been sent.

Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - the idea of a comic book sprang to mind: the lack of drawing skills did not slow down
The organic cabin once left my husband's statement suggesting it for a story I developed as a person, "says Sari Piippo, a comic blogger, housewife and former EU translator from Espoo.
Sari Piippo says she was an EU translator who had done economic and legal affairs in Brussels until after the fourth child the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I have enjoyed being a housewife very well.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it came to mind what to do when I was big, when even the smallest child started to be big.
Then in 2014 came the cartoon.
Piippo says he had never dreamed of making a comic book, even though he had read Donald Duck, Tintin and Asterix from a young age.
I had last drawn as a child, but when these manuscripts of Luomuhömpä started to emerge then, the situation changed.
I first made some dozens of manuscripts in the drawer.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a skilled cartoonist, but I couldn't attract her until the summer of 2016 when I donated Viivi with the help of a drawing board.
His enthusiasm lasted a dozen stripes, and then he had to start trying himself, laughs Piippo, who says that the drawing board was a great incentive for him.
The drawing board is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something done.
I didn't even try to draw on paper, "says Piippo about his relationship with drawing, which he usually practises in the evenings.
The manuscripts keep pop into my mind, but usually I don't make it ready at once.
One strip of three squares takes up to several hours.
I might make a screen at a time and be happy to play with colours.
Starting drawing is always the hardest thing because drawing is not my strongest sport.
Sari Piippo says she appreciates Scott Adams' Dilbert, among others, from contemporary newspaper cartoons.
The people in the organic cabin are a carrot-body mother with salad hair cushion who has hovered over the L theme.
The other persons are Man, Pissis and Twins.
In a more organic world, man is what he eats.
The ideas in the series come from one's own life and social media.
Sari Piippo does not want to preach or offer a bottle, even though organic heat sometimes invades the matter.
Piippo says she reads her series with her husband and children.
After all, it is such a great feeling when you look at the comic book you have drawn and say that this is what I have done today.
And there are challenges for housewives!

Indonesia earthquake: Air traffic controller sacrificed himself - didn't leave cracking tower until he got hundreds of passengers to safety
The 21-year-old air traffic controller Anthonius Gunawan Agung has become the hero of the earthquake in Indonesia.
Agung was left alone in the control tower until she could safely escort a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people from the earthquake-shaken island.
The youngster was in charge of air traffic control at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in the city of Palun when the earthquake struck on Friday.
As others fled the control tower, Agung refused to leave her seat until she was able to steer the Batik Air airliner from the runway into the air.
This allowed him to save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian Aviation Administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The control tower trembled and cracked.
Eventually Agung tried to save herself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg broke and he suffered serious internal organ injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was to be transported by helicopter to a better equipped facility, but died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, a spokesman for the Aviation Administration told The Jakarta Post.
The quake continued to intensify after the flight got into the air and was eventually measured at 7.5 magnitudes.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian Aviation Administration has paid tribute to Agung's heroism on social media.

Rehn wondered at Ylellä about Europe ending up in a trade war: "You have to look at the following tweet"
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected throughout the global economy.
Growth forecasts have been lowered throughout Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly lowered its own economic growth estimates.
Chief Executive Olli Rehn said in Yle's number one morning that while the escalating tension will not have a direct impact on European trade flows, it will undermine confidence, which in turn will be reflected in companies' investment decisions.
The situation also applies to the exports of Finnish enterprises.
In Mr Rehn's view, Europe is a great talent so far.
It has been able to build an interim peace with the United States and has also contributed to calming the situation with China and Japan.
In Rehn's view, Europe does not seem to be grinding to the feet of a trade war.
You have to look at the next tweet and then evaluate it.
We have a pretty unpredictable partner in Washington's direction, however, he said in an interview with Yle.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is Italy, the third largest national economy in the euro area, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and in the Western world as a whole.
Markets reacted sharply yesterday to the clearly deficit budget presented by the Italian government on Thursday night.
Next year's deficit will be over 2.4 per cent of national product.
Mr Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
5% of the country's loan stock is problem credit and more than 10% is unstructured credit.
In addition, its public finances are weak and the country again seems to be exceeding its commitments vis-à-vis its European partners.
It may not be worth painting yet more crises, Rehn replied when asked whether Italy would take Europe into a new economic crisis.
Another issue facing Europe is Britain's departure from the EU.
Mr Rehn hoped that it would be in harmony.
A contentious difference would have much more negative effects.
Rehn took over as Governor of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), will step down in just over a year's time.
The debate over his successor has begun.
The name of both Rehn and his predecessor, Erkki Liikanen, has glimpsed in the speeches.
It probably doesn't matter if Finnish names are included, "Rehn said, adding that he doesn't intend to comment further.

HS's super-popular Black Box performances will continue again next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black Box performances organised by Helsingin Sanomat will continue again in the coming week.
Other performances will be seen at the National Theatre on 2, 8 and 11 October.
On 23 October, the Black Box will visit Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets for the National Theatre on sale.
Tampere's performance is sold out.
Tickets are sold by Lippu.fi.
Journalists and photographers appearing on stage during the evening will tell a true story they have long prepared, which has not previously been published on any HS medium.
Once again, there is something that no one has ever heard.
"There is a strange spy on the night of Helsinki, an impressive report from the other side of the globe and an eloquent story about a very topical health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the performance, the public will have the opportunity to meet HS journalists and photographers and continue the debate.
Helsingin Sanomat has been organizing live journalism evenings for three years.
They have been popular from the start and often sold out.
More than 15 000 people have already visited the grandstand.
The black box was awarded at the Bonnier gala as the journalistic act of the year.
The winners praised a new way of doing journalism, as well as the desire of journalists to come close to their readers.
The Black Box for the spring 2019 season will be seen at the National Theatre in March and April.
The performance will also visit Tampere and Turku.
The presentation to be seen at that time will have a different content from the evenings this autumn.

Missing fungal inhibitor found thanks to 'open-minded experiment'
The drone expertise of the Finnish police is among the best in the world: "We are asked for training"
According to the Rector of the Police University of Applied Sciences, the police can use the drone in addition to searching for missing persons, for example in crime scene investigations and intelligence tasks.
On Tuesday, the Oulu police managed to find a missing mushroom inhibitor in Raahe with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, Rector of the Police University of Applied Sciences, referred to the case and mentioned, among other things, that "through open-minded experimentation and effective training, we are world leaders here too."
Drone is quite a new chapel and even newer in police duties.
Nowhere are there any statistics that the Finnish police are the champion of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong perception that this is the case.
This has become clear, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported at international events.
There is an awful lot of interest in it elsewhere, "Himberg says.
There would be a lot of visitors to see the drone activities of the Finnish police.
We are being asked about training.
Increasingly widespread
Himberg points out that finding someone who has disappeared in Finnish winter conditions as soon as possible is very important.
As has been said, in the case of Raahe, the lost person was found with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, they are to be further trained.
The drone is already widely used in police tasks and will become more common and more common in the future.
That is what I would venture to say, "Himberg says.
According to Himberg, in addition to searching for missing persons, the police can use drones, for example, in accident or crime scene investigations and in certain types of intelligence tasks.
For example, we already have to go and check a region a little further away, where there may be fears of violence.
Drone can then be used for advance enquiry.

Karelian Rugby rose to number one
Karelian Rugby celebrated the victory of Division 2 in Kuopio on Saturday.
Joensuulainen was still in the middle of the match with a 7-12 loss to Helsinki Rugby Club, but found a plot in the second period and whispered the guests from the south 26-12.
At the same time, the 2-division championship knew the historic rise of Karelian Rugby to the 1-division.
In the past, the club has played number one, but at that time the Finnish rugby league was divided into two levels, the Finnish Championship series and several sections of Division 1.
The Society intends to take up the serial position, but it knows quite a lot of work for next winter.
The current roster of just under twenty players must be increased to 25.
Division 1 also knows the increase in the number of games and longer game distances, so fundraising must also be in line with that.

Kotkaniemi starts season in Montreal, confirms head coach
Montreal Canadiens head coach Claude Julien, who plays in the NHL, confirmed on the club's Twitter account that Finnish attacker Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked a super promise in Kotkaniemi, 18, in the first round with number three at the summer booking ceremony.
The attacker joined Montreal's training strength in late summer and has made strong excerpts in September training matches.
Kotkaniemi managed to score a goal in his first training match.
Head coach Julien praised the Finn for taking big steps forward since arriving at the newcomer camp.
The NHL regular season starts on the night against Thursday next week Finnish time.
Montreal will face the Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round.

What is a good leader like?
A lot has been said in Finland this week about management.
Risto Siilasmaa, Chairman of Nokia's Board of Directors, told in an interview with HS about his book Paranoid optimist, in which he sheds light on his management philosophy.
At the same time, he criticises the leadership of his predecessor Jorma Ollila.
Ollila strongly denied the accusations, but previous Nokia reports have also talked about the inability of managers to act as a team; fear and lack of talk, which in part caused the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The risk-taking capacity and agility of the company's boom phase disappeared.
During the week, Helsinki also held a giant business event, the Nordic Business Forum, which drew the cream of Finnish business to the Exhibition Centre.
In addition to the main star Barack Obama, 12 stars from the business world took the stage.
There was enough talk of good management.
Gary Hamel, the legend of management doctrines, said that a good manager must have the courage to take the company into the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most mentally linked to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, founder of the Whole Foods store chain, known for its wide range of organic products, said that the director must be able to communicate to all staff the purpose of the company.
And that purpose cannot simply be to make a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote a success book about introverts, told us that the most successful leaders are, according to research, humble.
They acted calmly, quietly and purposefully.
Often they are introverts.
Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance, pointed out that the qualities of a good manager must coincide with the stage of a company's life cycle.
In the early stages of the company, the director must be able to tell the story on which the company's future is based.
A company that has grown to a mature stage needs a manager who knows the numbers.
7,500 visitors - mainly Finnish leaders - listened to these teachings at the Nordic Business Forum.
They were in danger of having an information source.
A lot is required of a good leader.
That is why management so often goes wrong, including at the highest level.
Siilasmaa and Ollila were also present.
They talked to each other behind the scenes in a comradely manner.
However, they hardly wondered whether they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy for an outsider to judge.

Macedonia's name has been divisive for decades - now the people are voting in contentious elections
Macedonia in the Balkans is currently voting on a proposal for a new name for the country.
Under the agreement between the Macedonian and Greek governments, the name would be the Republic of North Macedonia.
Until now, Greece has vetoed Macedonia's efforts to become a member of NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The referendum question does not mention a new name, but asks whether the voter is in favour of Macedonia's membership of the EU and NATO by approving the agreement.
Voting started sluggishly, at least at a school in the centre of the capital, Skopje.
Olivera Argirosvka, a retired nurse who voted at the school, hoped for support for the agreement.
The referendum will mean change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
It means change, especially for young people, "he said.
Macedonia, which became independent in 1991, has been officially referred to as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
The government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has campaigned for the agreement to be approved.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, there is plenty to be tense about whether turnout will rise above the required 50%.
The referendum is not binding, but a "yes" vote would give a mandate to change the constitution.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is needed to change the constitution.
The agreement has also yet to be approved by the Greek Parliament.

Erkan Teperi was knocked out by Robert Helenius
Robert Helenius faced Erkan Teper late on Saturday night in a heavyweight professional boxing match in Germany.
The 34-year-old Finn measured his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch near Stuttgart.
The main match of the evening was the IBF heavyweight Intercontinental title match.
Its winner may be given the opportunity to compete in tougher positions than those seen on Saturday, which are of considerable economic importance.
Helenius settled the match in the eighth period, when he knocked Teperi out with his hard left hand.
Teper was no longer able to rise from the floor.
"Nordic Nightmare" hurt his opponent already in the third period, when the German's nose started to bleed.
Helenius and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They were supposed to take as early as December 2015.
That's when Teper appealed for injury and withdrew from the match.
It then emerged that the German had undergone a doping test twice.
Helenius has taken 28 matches in his professional career and suffered two losses.
Teper, who went into the match as a clear favourite, has won 19 professional matches in his career and lost three times.

Canada fights against time to reach agreement on NAFTA with US
Time is running out in the middle of negotiations between the United States and Canada on a free trade agreement on NAFTA.
The United States has set a deadline of Sunday, and their negotiators have been talking intensively through the weekend.
Canada's chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed her speech to the UN General Assembly in order to focus fully on trade negotiations.
At President Donald Trump's insistence, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago to reform NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement, but no agreement has yet been reached with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want to bring the agreement into force before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won Mexico's presidential election, takes office in early December.
Trump has said that Canada's involvement in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that there are plans to sign the agreement at the end of November - whether Canada is involved or not.
In view of these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday to allow sufficient time for the US Congress to assess it.

Students play a rare treat: an ancient tragedy - reduced Oresteia is affected by its visuality
Ancient tragedies are a rare treat on Finnish stages.
For example, the National Theatre last saw an ancient tragedy, the Philoctetes of Sofia, in 1988.
Now the Theatre Academy brought the only surviving play trilogy, the Oresteia of Aeschylus, to the tour starting from the National Theatre.
In the Lavat auki! projects, which started in 2015, acting students at the Theatre Academy work together with a professional director internationally.
This fourth project, like the first, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
Oresteia premiered in Berlin in April.
Roiha's atonement for Oresteia summarizes the story of the end of the bloodshed of the doomed Atreus family and the establishment of the rule of law in an hour and twenty minutes, especially by condensing the choir sections.
The work manages to be very faithful to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsuuri's fine Finnish translation (2003).
Dramatic lights and a display revealing the pages of the theatre space highlight simplistic and bright stage thinking.
At its centre is alternately the dynamics between performers who break away from the choir, playing name roles, and the choir.
The performance uses both double and triple interpretations of name roles.
Actors do not leave the stage at all, so the murders of Agamemnon, who is returning from the Trojan War, and Kassandra, for example, are also shown on the stage, contrary to ancient performance tradition.
Of course, the performance does not stress that it is faithful to the ancient tradition of performance.
Rather, a modern interpretation faithful to the text is created in front of the viewer's eyes, constantly aware of its ritual roots.
Roiha has managed to bring out a rhythmic group of acting students from the Master's stage as a compact group, indeed as one organism.
Especially in the choir sections, actors who flexibly bend to very expressive, sculptural group formations get their rights on a bare stage, only decorated with a white curtain.
Impressive.
Oresteia's performance tour continues to Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.

The novelty is starting to show in Europe, especially thanks to the cooperation agreement between Hyindai and Swiss company H2 Energy.
According to the cooperation agreement published at the Hanover IAA commercial vehicle show, Hyundai will make a thousand-car batch of new models available to the Swiss company and its partners.
By launching a fuel cell-powered truck, Hyundai continues the path mapped out by Nexo and ix35 / Tucson Fuel Cell as a hydrogen car manufacturer.
With this first project of its kind in the world, we are taking fuel cell technology further and further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market for these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the refuelling network, "said In Cheol Lee, Executive Vice President of Hyundai Motor, at the launch of the contract.

The fist fiddled several times in Kajaani
Three men were assaulted by a man in his thirties in and off a restaurant in the centre of Kajaani on Saturday morning.
The man first struck one man inside the restaurant and was removed as a result.
Outside, he pushed another man to the ground, and when the third man intervened, he was still beaten by the abuser.
The assailant was apprehended by the police.
At the police station, the man continued to behave aggressively and kicked another police officer in the leg.
The man also threatened the police with assault and killing.
The man was taken to the tube to calm down.
The case is being investigated as three assaults as well as violent opposition to an official.
There was also another assault in the centre of Kajaani in Välikatu on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, a Kajaani man aged about 20 struck the victim.
A short time later, another man knocked him down and the man who struck him earlier still kicked the victim.
Outsiders pulled the assailants further away from the victim and police were called.
However, the perpetrators already had time to leave before the police arrived.
The police ask eyewitnesses to contact the Kajaani police by phone 0295 416 520 or by e-mail to tutkinta.kainuu @ poliisi.fi.

The safety of aunts and sets in the shop must be guaranteed
I was first paid for a newspaper story in 1984.
When you get amazed by something on these annual rings, it's usually big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was amazed and at times even a little angry.
I also spoke to Erika Kähärä, a working environment expert at the Trade Union of Services (PAM).
He says that crime statistics do not reflect the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers, of course, claim otherwise.
Only cases that are clearly perceived to be serious come to the attention of the police and many real situations of violence go unreported.
"Of course, companies have a duty to record their near misses on the basis of the Occupational Safety Act, but these statistics remain for internal use and their data are not collected anywhere," he said.
Mental injuries do not end up in the statistics.
In situations of violence, the problem has always been that they do not always lead to physical injuries.
Despite this, mental trauma can be much more serious than bruising and wounds.
The difference between a violent situation and a threatening violent situation is difficult to draw when a certain level of aggressive threats must also be counted as violence - even if there is no access.
Too many people are afraid in their workplace, even if the actual act does not happen.
Some neighbourhoods are unsettled.
The store has acquired guards.
When shop opening hours were liberalised, the media also showed quite a lot of fuss about its impact on the safety of sellers.
"At that time, quite a few employers organised guard services at least for night-time hours and to prevent working alone," Kähärä commented.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is drawn.
This now seems to have had an effective effect, but this produces a new negative trend.
When, as a result of security, disturbances remained well in hand, the impression was created that security was unnecessary.
Now, in many places, attempts are being made to find solutions that could eliminate expensive guard services.
Mild assault is a plaintiff's crime, and it is quite understandable that a seller who has been assaulted does not want to make a request for an investigation into a criminal who usually lives near a shop.
But under the same subparagraph of the law enacted in 2011, a minor assault becomes subject to prosecution if it takes place in the workplace.
I believe that precedents are now needed.
The next time an aunt or uncle in a shop is assaulted, the police should investigate and the prosecutor should prosecute.
When the court put a few abusers in prison, and the sentence from there at the hard end of the penalty scale, the habits would be tidied up.
A society in which the grocery trade must be open almost day and night in small towns must guarantee the safety of shop workers.

Heidi Sohlberg set off for the mission before the live broadcast started - "Sara, Iiro is then married"
Missi's crown will not be seen on TV in the traditional way this year, but will be shown on the Viafree website.
The broadcast is hosted by former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and Iiro Harjula, host of Viasat and Viaplay's NHL and KHL studios.
Backstage and the red carpet are hosted by Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the trio of presenters told invited guests and media representatives who had arrived about the course of the broadcast.
Initially, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula loud applause.
Now all the women are screaming!
Now look at this male presenter of ours, Sohlberg glowed at his colleague as the audience cheered.
The front row will be followed by many Miss Finland from previous years.
Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi, among others, sat side by side and Sohlberg threw a little joke in either direction.
Sara, Iiro is then married!
Sohlberg chopped looking towards Saros.
The more likely Sohlberg referred with his throw to the newly divorced Sieppi, who laughed at the comment, even though he seemed confused at first.
Sieppi spoke about her resignation for the first time in Ilta-Sanomat's weekend newspaper.
Missikaunotar said that she did not want to open up the reasons for the resignation in more detail in public, as it was a matter between her and Scrooge Salminen.
He said he was not in a hurry for a new relationship, but was going to focus on himself.
I will focus on my own stuff and especially start living my own life alone, "Sara Sieppi said.
Harjula's marriage status came up even later when Sohlberg accidentally made the mistake of calling Janni Hussi and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The trio of presenters laughed at the moka.
After all, Iiro was married or how did it get married?
Janni Hussi set off the moka.

Nordic man tortured his bound unmarried partner by slashing, burning and feeding strong sauce
The District Court of Ostrobothnia has sentenced a 34-year-old man living in Kokkola to three years in prison for numerous offences against his unmarried partner.
The means of committing the crime included a belt, cable and zip ties.
The court confiscated the items in question to the state.
The harshest charge concerned a suspected aggravated rape.
However, this charge was dismissed by the district court.
Kokkola was charged with four counts of assault, aggravated assault, coercion, unlawful threat, deprivation of liberty, aggravated deprivation of liberty and two counts of damage.
The offences took place between 26 March last year and 24 May.
At the end of the last acts, the man was apprehended and imprisoned a few days later.
On Thursday of the past week, the Ostrobothnian District Court handed down its verdict and ordered the 34-year-old to remain in Vaasa Prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also charged with two counts of aggravated deprivation of liberty and aggravated rape on 22 May.
However, these charges were dismissed as unproven by the court.
The case was heard in court behind closed doors.
However, the district judge issued a public report on the judgment.
According to the district judge, the accused had subjected his spouse to violence, threats and coercion in situations where he had been bound.
The accused slashed his victim with a knife, smoked tobacco, fed strong sauce and poured water and coffee on top of him.
By sentencing, the court ordered the confiscation of criminal equipment: a belt and cable, zip ties, a bathrobe belt, a knife and a water cleaner.
Four Witnesses
According to the District Court, the parties continued to live together between the acts.
It can be read from the sentencing statement that a large proportion of the most serious acts took place at the end of the crime period.
Four witnesses, two women and two men were heard in court.
The 34-year-old victim must be compensated for pain, suffering, suffering and temporary harm for a total of EUR 5,800.
He hardly has that money, because the sentenced person already has debts in the past.
The prison sentence is not the man's first.
Iltalehti does not give the name of the sentenced person to protect the victim's privacy.
The recent district judgment is not final at the time of writing.
Now that they know about you, the release of prisoners is off the table.

Europe lead by four points to Ryder Cup solution
European golf professionals solidified their lead in a traditional hole game match against the United States on Saturday.
Europe leads the Ryder Cup around Paris with 10-6 points, while there are still twelve double games to be played on Sunday.
Europe won three of the four quadruple-ball matches that started Saturday, and in the afternoon doubles the victories were equalised 2-2.
Europe's leading stars were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches they played in pairs on Friday and Saturday.
In the past, no European couple had achieved this.
On Sunday, the duo will pursue more history.
No European player has won five points in one Ryder Cup, and even the Americans have only three players: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).

HJK condemns the violent harassment of its supporters in the Honka match: "Violence is not part of football"
On Sunday, the football league team HJK published a press release condemning the disruptive behaviour of its supporters in Saturday's FC Honka match in Tapiola.
"We apologise for the events following the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," the release states.
At the end of the match, about 50 HJK supporters rushed to the field and some seemed to be trying to challenge Honga's supporters.
There was also a fight between supporters.
The organisers were unable to calm the situation down and police officers and also cavalry officers were needed.
HJK says in its press release that the team's players and staff are shocked by what has happened.
Events after the match are not in line with the values of our traditional 111-year-old club.
"We strongly dissociate ourselves from any activity that endangers the safety of match events," the release states.
The HJK promises to help authorities and event organisers identify security threats and eliminate side effects.
Supporter culture is part of football and an important issue for HJK.

Filipino inventor flies by drone car - this avoids traffic jams
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Clown Fearless.
He is now among a growing number of people around the world who swear that they have invented a flying car - or at least their own version of it.
As competitors, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
Mendiola, however, does not believe in mass production of its equipment.
The man has spent much of his fortune building his dream, according to reports from around the world.
He started developing his flying car six years ago.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
More recently, he says he made his first successful test flight - he flagged at an altitude of more than seven metres with his device.
Indeed, one of his goals was to avoid traffic congestion.
I hope that the device will provoke positive reactions.

JHL anticipates: Industrial action starting tomorrow will be visible in child day care and social and health services
Overtime and shift bans starting tomorrow in the public and welfare sectors will be particularly visible in social and health services and in child day care, "says Päivi Niemi-Laine, Chairman of the JHL.
The impact will be extensive and will certainly be felt in such a way that there will not be enough staff on the ground.
Everyone has to think about how to pick up their children.
It is now up to the employer to ensure that the services play and that no one's life is threatened, "Niemi-Laine says to STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the shortage of employees was also visible at the beginning of the year, when JHL members were banned from working overtime and changing shifts due to contract negotiations.
Through flexibility, employers have made it possible for staff not to be hired, but for workers to remain overtime or change shifts.
This is not yet an industrial action.
It is the norm in terms of health and safety at work that regular working hours are taken care of and only done for every worker.
The JHL opposes the government's intention to lighten protection against dismissal for small businesses.
Markku Jalonen, Labour Market Director of Municipal Employers, will not prejudge the impact of bans on overtime and shift.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although services may deteriorate.
Employers around Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations for what can be done.
The area is so vast, social and health care and the technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The effects can vary very much by industry, region and employer, Jalonen said to STT.
Jalonen says that last week there was already experience of similar three-day activities by the Association of Local and Primary Nurses Superi and the social and health professional organisation Tehy, among others.
Their effects were quite limited.
The JHL's ban on overtime and shift changes applies to municipal, church, state and private social and health care workers, among others.
Family day nurses, for example, are excluded.
At this stage, almost 100 000 JHL members are affected by the industrial action.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL activities may take a long time.
The union is also prepared for other industrial action if preparations for the dismissal law continue.
The government should now admit that this is running to the wall and hard.
Jalonen believes that both the trade union movement and the government must meet.
It is curious here that hard is already in the barrel, even though the performance has not yet been given, Jalonen updates.
He acknowledged that, in this situation, it would be a major victory for the German Presidency if a follow-up plan could be drawn up, and pointed out that the 18 Member States that had already ratified the Constitutional Treaty should not be forgotten.

The Great Coral Reef is created by children and adults - the performance's fitness circles study the gestures of rays and sea horses
The Great Coral Reef premiered last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was performed for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the group's previous works, the Great Coral Reef is a work that is built from start to finish together with the audience.
This time, however, a clearer presentation will also be built, which will refresh and crystallise the observations made in the initial exercises.
There is also plenty of fairytale magic in theatre play for child participants.
The child's perspective has already been included in the preparation of the work.
However, the Great Coral Reef is not a children's performance, but a performance made jointly by adults and children.
It provides adults with information and observations on the way children receive information and make art.
Children's ability to throw themselves into exercises and joint games also soaks the distance between adults and children.
The Great Coral Reef is somewhat reminiscent of fairytale ballet, fitness circuit and nature-related information, but it is finally tuned around visits to other, non-human conditions.
The Great Coral Reef begins with getting to know the movements of corals and the organisms and fish living on the coral reef.
Six different fitness districts learn, among other things, rays and sea horse gestures.
Finally, a performance of less than an hour will be made, where music, lights and shiny paints and costumes will help you get to know the life of the coral reef.
The Great Coral Reef has both diving people observing the life of the coral reef and the corals that are being looked at.
There are also organisms that look at corals.
The multi-directional gaze and observations make the performance dense and life-buzzing.
Be the landscape of an organism, an organism looking at the landscape, and another organism or landscape looking at an organism - and all this at the same time.
For children, it does not seem difficult in any way.
In other spaces, the group aims to reach the limit of thinking and action through its exercises, which is challenging to catch up with when the group consists of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more significant.
After the workshop, a silent demonstration will be held in Sitrator for endangered corals.

Children grow up too fast - I am happy that there were no smartphones in my childhood
Today's children and young people are becoming increasingly irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking at an ever younger and younger age.
In my opinion, children should be children throughout their childhood and not mess up their lives because of substance abuse and sex, because others say they do.
I was taken aback when my friend told me that he had had to pick up his sister in fifth grade at the weekend from a "boyfriend."
When she came to get her drunk sister, she shared her sex experiences that evening.
I could not possibly imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we have been told and warned throughout our childhood that intoxicants must not be touched and sex is an adult thing.
I wish modern children would be able to live a decent childhood and not have to grow up too early because of the group pressure created by friends.

Yle: Authorities told state leadership that Airiston Helmi case is not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, interviewed by Yle, the protection police and the armed forces went to inform the defence and foreign affairs committees earlier this week.
The Finnish state leadership has been told that the Airiston Pearl investigation is not currently related to national security, but to organised crime, reports Yle.
The information from anonymous sources was confirmed to Ylelle by Ilkka Kanerva, Chairman of the Committee on Defence.
According to Kanerva, the armed forces and the protection police visited the defence and foreign affairs committees this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is primarily considered economic crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that there was anything else here, Kanerva commented in an interview with Yle.
According to top information, there has so far been no evidence of a link to national security in the seized material, but the investigation is only just beginning.
We cannot yet know what can be revealed there, "says one of Yle's interviewees.
The extensive searches that began a week ago in the Turku archipelago and on the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is simply a matter of financial crime or a threat to Finland's internal security.

Video: dream goal saved Liverpool's defeated series
Liverpool's 100 per cent Premier League start came to an end, but it was still a happier team with a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.
Sunday marks exactly one year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and escaped to a 1-0 away victory.
That's when Pep Guardiola's combination sent a signal throughout the Premier League that City were now serious.
Everyone remembers how last season ended.
And certainly Liverpool manager Jûrgen Klopp arrived in west London with the same idea.
The Reds had started the Premier League with six consecutive victories.
Liverpool started stronger and Virgil van Dijk in particular seemed to dominate alone after his own end of the field.
Chelsea, meanwhile, had a fine League Cup away win from Anfield Road on Wednesday.
That's when Eden Hazard emerged from the shunting bench to solve the match with a great individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was involved from the very beginning.
In the 25th minute he first juggled a triangular game with Mateo Kovac and Jorginho in a small space.
Eventually, the Croat saw Hazard plunge forward and sent him a perfectly weighted pass.
Hazard drifted a little to the edge of the penalty area, but from there bombed a perfect left-foot bet into the back corner.
Pool Brazil keeper Alisson was a little slow in his fight and could only get his finger on the ball.
Klopp certainly felt the losing position lightly unfair because almost immediately afterwards Antonio Rüdiger dropped Mo Salah's guidance from the finish line.
In the second period, Chelsea veskari Kepa also got down to business.
The Basque keeper reacted quickly to Sadio Mané's bet and pushed the ball from the bottom of the pole into a corner kick.
At the other end, meanwhile, Alisson reset Hazard's run-through with his throwing.
The best place for the guests came in the 72nd minute when James Milner found Bobby Firmino with his concentration.
Brassitähti's butt, however, was directed towards national team mate David Luiz, who saved the hosts "lead.
That didn't last any longer in the 89th minute either, when exchange man Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot from 25 metres.
Sturridge played in his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed an irresistible bet on the top corner in honour of it.
Liverpool's 100 per cent league start came to an end with a 1-1 draw but it remains top of the league - along with Manchester City.
Chelsea are also firmly involved in the championship battle two points behind the top.

In the clock transfer debate, poteros are deep
I remember when, a few decades ago, a newspaper asked various Finnish influencers what divides the Finnish people.
Juice Leskinen's answer was the only one left in mind: the Nen terminal.
Some have a nen terminal in their surname and some do not.
After all, divisions can arise anywhere, and here was one bidder.
In the EU, Finland has brought about the abolition of annual clock shifting.
Very many people agree that clock shifting twice a year has been the job of fools and has caused a wide range of problems.
In the end, this achievement seems to be the easiest phase of the solution, at least in Finland, although it has not been easy.
The hardest thing now is to decide what time will eventually end up: the current summer or winter time or some other time zone.
The people can also give their opinion on this on the otakantaa.fi page.
The inquiry has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open until Friday 12 October.
The debate is heated at coffee tables and on social media, and everyone has their say.
Those who defend winter time justify their position on the impact of morning light on people's well-being and summer time on the impact of evening light on people's desire for outdoor activities and thus on their well-being.
Both positions have strong supporters and good arguments.
According to research, morning light rhythms a person's day and gives refreshment.
On the other hand, if you do not particularly suffer from waking up in the dark, light increases the movement of people outdoors and gives better opportunities for autumn yard work, for example.
The amount of extra light after a normal working day has already been calculated for an hour.
I would prefer to take both, but unfortunately we cannot do anything about our location in the north of the globe.
Winters are too dark and summers are too bright for many anyway.
A typical feature of the debate on this subject is that one's own view is promoted and the other's view is very strongly opposed.
The arguments of the other side are hardly listened to, because the most important thing is how you feel.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on this, it is somewhat pointless to try to turn the other's head.
It is a waste of gunpowder.
The subject is terribly easy to argue about, because it does not require a great deal of effort and there is enough sense of mud to justify it.
Similar issues tend to be the subject of the sharpest and equally fruitless controversy anyway.
It is a pity if the wrong option is chosen, but it will not adapt.
And it always offers a suitable scapegoat if life feels apathetic.
I cannot believe that a sparkling-eyed Ethel with an angel's smile and the most beautiful body in the Midwest...
Josba fought for a narrow guest victory
Josba's first guest game in the floorball Divari produced a full three series points against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba went home from Seinäjoki with a joyful 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Nurmo still led with a goal at the start of the third period, but Josba applied for compositions and recycled men in chains.
In time 50.47 brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi scored a 6-5 winning goal.
As both teams cooled, crucial minutes were played evenly.
Josba's most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2 + 1).
The second chain was firepower anyway, when Teemu Tuhkanen (1 + 1), Jere Kaartinen (1 + 0) and Jere Kettunen (1 + 0) also hit.
Miika Kosonen (1 + 0) also played in the second chain at the time of her goal.
Josba has six points after three rounds.

200th anniversary celebrations in Eno Church on Sunday
The 200th anniversary of Eno Church will be celebrated tomorrow, Sunday, partly in a very sad atmosphere.
The arson of Kiihtelysvaara Church a week ago was a shock.
Eno Church was also guarded in the two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still a place to celebrate.
Even if no one wants to, Eno Church is now the oldest church in the Joensuu parish group.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno, despite all the municipal and other connections in the world.
The family fair begins in Eno Church today at 10 a.m.
After that we move to the parish house to the Karelian table.
Throughout the day, the programme includes all kinds of things both inside and outside.
For example, you can get to know the church building under the guidance of Ari Räsänen, who has retired and has been a parish master for 37 years.
The church's birthday celebration also marks the end of an era.
The already decommissioned parish house, built in 1982, will keep its doors open today for the last time.
Now we are in dodging rooms at the former town hall, "says Markku Koistinen, a chaplain.
The parish house was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has been standing in a healthy place for that 200 years.

Elon Musk steps down as head of Tesla board speech - Fraud charges agreed for $40 million
Tesla, the electric car maker, and Elon Musk, the company's chief executive, have settled their lawsuit with the SEC, the US securities regulator.
The SEC suspected Musk of securities fraud and Musk was in danger of being sidelined as a result of the company he founded.
Musk, however, will be allowed to continue as Tesla's CEO.
Instead, Musk will have to step down as Tesla's board chairman for three years.
The company will have to hire an external Chairman of the Board.
Musk will also face tighter controls.
Under the agreement, Tesla will have to hire two independent directors and monitor Musk's communications more closely in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk will each pay $20 million (about €17 million) to settle the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent further market disruption and harm to Tesla shareholders," says Steven Peikin, director of the SEC.
The case began in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might withdraw the company from the stock exchange.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding is secure.
The suite momentarily raised Tesla's share price.
The SEC suspected Musk of securities fraud.
The agency said the tweet was false and misleading, and Musk had not spoken about the arrangement with the company's other management or potential financiers.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
The SEC announced Friday that it would sue the company and Musk.
The SEC said it was calling for Musk to be fined and banned from running any more listed companies.
Investors were frightened by the SEC's challenge, and Tesla's stock went down sharply.

More than 800 people killed in Indonesia quake and tsunami
The number of people killed in the earthquake in Indonesia and the tsunami that followed has risen to at least 832, according to AFP, the country's disaster agency.
The number of fatalities is expected to increase further, as the damage is still being investigated.
According to Vice-President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure could reach thousands.
Friday's earthquake sparked a tsunami that hit the town of Palun on the island of Sulawesi.
Immediately after the earthquake, a warning was issued about the tsunami, but it was quickly withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all known deaths are from Palu, at least for the time being.
Rescue officials are concerned, among other things, about the Donggala area near the centre of the quake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Many people are already known to have died.
Requests for help from the ruins
The Indonesian army has been alerted to help rescue workers look for victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived in the affected area today, urged soldiers to continue rescue work tirelessly day and night.
One of the focal points of the rescue work is the hotel in Palu, where between 50 and 60 people are still believed to be in ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the agency leading the rescue work, said that one person survived at night from the ruins of the Roa-Roa Hotel, which was popular with business travellers.
We also heard people's requests for help, "he said.
According to Syaug, heavy clearing equipment would be needed quickly in the quake and tsunami area.

Politicians' phone numbers leaked into the hands of troublemakers in Britain
Many British politicians were harassed when their contact details were leaked due to shortcomings in the encryption of the app.
Disturbances were able to access ministers' telephone numbers, among other things.
It was an application used at the party conference of the British Conservative Party in government.
For example, Michael Gove, the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Minister who is pushing for Brexit, and Boris Johnson, the former Foreign Secretary, were harassed.
Several MPs received harassment calls.
Due to the lack of encryption on the app, the public had access to the profiles of politicians who were on the mobile app for the Conservative Party's annual conference.
The profiles were accessed by the public using the politician's email address, which was easily accessible online.
Anyone logging in to the profile was able to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to swap Boris Johnson's profile photo for a moment for a porn photo and title insulting.
Michael Goven's profile picture was changed to that of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
Dawn Foster, a columnist for The Guardian, described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows login to other people's profiles with their email addresses.
Then you can view the profile person's contact details and, for example, send messages in his or her name.
The meeting app made every journalist, politician and participant's phone number public, Foster criticized.

The Wall Finland quiz has a large number of applauding Poles in the audience every week
Close-eyed viewers drew attention to the reactions of the studio audience on The Wall Finland quiz show.
The Wall, a US format that has spread rapidly around the world, landed in the Finland version for Nelonen last Saturday.
The game show, hosted by Heikki Paasonen, has been filmed in Poland in the same studio where other international productions of the format are made.
In the Polish studio, the filming possibilities were exceptional, as the format's large 12-metre-high game wall required space from the farm.
During the start-up period, the studio audience of the programme, which was played in Polish, was highlighted on social media.
There was a debate on Twitter about whether the Poles sitting in the studio might understand anything about the game being played in Finnish.
Unne Sormunen, Head of Four Finnish Programmes, illuminates the matter for Iltalehti.
He says that the studio audience includes close players, other Finns, expatriates living in Poland and Polish viewers.
The audience consists of international claps in Finnish production, just like the audiences of The Wall episodes filmed in the same production space in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such groups, so-called professional audiences, who go to the filming of different programmes, Sormunen explains.
He points out that following the game itself is not so difficult to understand, even if you do not understand the language in which it is played.
It is easy to distinguish between red and green balls falling from the wall.
For foreign-language speakers, however, interpreters will be present in the studio to do the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret events simultaneously for the studio director all the time.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells them what kind of flap is being thrown there, for example, and what the situation is going on, "Sormunen says.
He compares the situation to what happened recently with David Hasselhoff in domestic production.
David Hasselhoff was involved in Talent Finland's filming in Finland a few years ago.
He had simultaneous interpretation in his ear all the time and knew everything that was said in Finnish in the descriptions, Sormunen sums up.

Aces' sky darkened even further
The early days of the Aces have been bad.
The sky darkened to almost pitch black when the team lost 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1) to Vaasa Sport on Saturday.
The Pori people now have five consecutive losses, with a total of two points from six rounds.
No Aces defender or player in the two lower chains has yet scored a goal.
Pressures are also increasing all the time.
Against Sport, the audience already escaped from the hall when almost half of the game was left.
Six games have only just been played and, of course, there is no reason to give up here.
Of course, we must be concerned, because that is how poorly we played.
Especially the performance of the second period was shamefully bad, "said Jarno Kärki, who made Aces 1 + 2.
Sport naturally tasted the victory.

Bread Day visitor numbers continued to grow
The mother of the bread day Pirkko Hyvärinen wonders about the audience of the event in the grandstand of the big hall.
Somehow you thought that maybe not so many people would come this year, Hyvärinen ponders in the morning.
In autumn 2017, Finnish Tractor Championships were held at the same time as Bread Day, so perhaps there would be expectations that the audience could even fall slightly from the previous year.
However, it turned out differently; the corridors were already blocked well before ten, sellers reported that the products had run out, more news porridge was sold than before for nearly 500 portions and Hyvärinen heard that there had been an increase in the number of cars.
The estimate of the number of visitors has been around 6,000, Hyvärinen says later in the afternoon.
The five hours of the morning and afternoon could accommodate a particularly large number of programmes for families with children, which would attract a record number of them.
In addition, Hyvärinen estimates that the event will reach even further afield.
Sellers also curve to Liperi every year from a larger area.
This year, almost a hundred rapporteurs, sellers of crafts, pastries and harvest products had arrived at the bread keeper.

7 x the most beautiful luminaire - here you can recognize a good lamp
Revive the space, create the right atmosphere in the interior and read the book without tiring your eyes.
It is worth investing in good lighting.
We put together three good reasons to invest in lighting.
Tips were given by Tarja Jokiniemi, Sales and Marketing Director of Innolux.
Do your eyes a favour
Lighting is becoming increasingly important the more years of age are behind it.
Adequate light can help with the problems that many people face with age, as visual acuity decreases and more people suffer from glare.
As parents, the need for light is also growing.
The sixties need three times more light than the twenties.
It is therefore worth investing in the therapeutic effects of light and the characteristics of the luminaire for health reasons.
A good luminaire gives enough light, but does not dazzle, Jokiniemi says.
Create beauty around you
The beautiful interior can only be seen with the right lighting solutions.
The decorator of the moment can afford to choose.
A gesture-free, Scandinavian-Japanese japandi style is popular.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro-style inspired by the 1970s, with its strong colours, different shades of metal or ice cream colours, has also become a boom.
Authenticity fascinates in the same way as in other home furnishings.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Exhibit Your Personality
On the other hand, more is being invested in the home now than before, and interior design has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, you want a tailor-made, bold luminaire with a story to tell in your own home.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So we are very design-conscious, "Jokiniemi says.
You don't necessarily get the latest trend luminaire at home, but a timeless classic that has been saved for many years.
Certain timeless, jewellery-like and elegant classics hold their ground year after year, Jokiniemi says.

The gambler wants to set an example in recycling - goods leave the world in recycling boxes, plastic changed to paper
Game specialist Gambler now recycles not only games but also packaging materials.
The products of stone shop customers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered online are packed in packaging from importers, for example.

There is a long tradition of sabotage by Russian intelligence services
There is no reason to suppose that the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence SVR or the military intelligence GRU have abandoned this course of action.
During the Soviet era, so-called DRG groups specialised in sabotage activities.
The name comes from the Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaja gruppa: sabotage and intelligence group.
The agents of the Soviet security service KGB in the West prepared detailed plans for important sabotage sites, "says Vasily Mitrohin, archivist who defected to the West of the KGB (1922-2004).
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s
The targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, the KGB acquired uniforms and accessories for the Bundeswehr, railways, game guards and road workers for DRG teams for covert operations.
This trick was used by Russian parachute soldiers in Crimea in February 2014: they wore local Ukrainian police riot gear, set up checkpoints on roads from the peninsula to Ukraine and isolated Crimea from its motherland.

HPK keeps Riska in its ranks for the rest of the season, Lehtinen's trial period ended
Mika Toivola, Sports Director of HPK in Hämeenlinna, says that Filip Riska (centre) has been important for the team in starts, under-power play and the defensive role of the fourth field.
Filip Riska, who played in the trial period in early autumn, will continue at HPK in Hämeenlinna for the rest of the season.
The success of the experienced Riska, 33, in the roles offered to him convinced the management.
Philip has been an important piece for us in starts, shorthanded play and the defensive role of the fourth field.
Although there is still room for improvement, it is good for the young team to stick to such an experienced player, HPK Sports Director Mika Toivola commented in the club's press release.
According to Toivola, the value of the risk rises when playing ice hockey league games.
Riska, a central striker from Pietarsaari, has previously played league hockey in JYP, Lukko and Sport.

True story on TV today: The climber was left to die twice
The American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on a man's own experiences.
The evening's film is based on them.
Everest will now premiere on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating snowstorm surprised climbers on Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákur's 2015 guidance reflects the struggle for survival, which has been dealt with extensively.
The tragedy has been the subject of films - and documentaries - before.
The facts are also being reviewed in this case.
Twenty-two years ago, the world's tallest mountain took the lives of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced leaders of the expeditions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who served as Weathers' guide.
Weathers' life could be saved by eye surgery carried out before leaving for Nepal.
As a result of this and air pressure, he lost sight, which meant that the conquest of the top had to be missed.
Rob Hall continued his journey and did not return.
Weathers' struggle for life and death, however, had only just begun.
When the storm rose, he got lost and could no longer find his way back to the camp.
When the man came to search, he was found in such a bad condition that survival was not believed.
Weathers was left to die.
Miraculously, however, he still got on his feet and found the others.
The badly frosted Weathers was still thought to be dying and once again he was left to his own devices.
What is clear is that, contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, fellow climbers also began to believe in the possibility enough to be given help.
In the film Beck Weathers is played by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Without him, we are a dying flock that will not receive reinforcements.
Indeed, it is becoming increasingly clear that there is a link between the incompatibility of tax policies in the European Union and serious unemployment.

The 200-year-old Eno Church has been celebrated today
Eno's 200-year-old church has been celebrated today on the church hill.
The church was inaugurated on 4 October 1818, and a celebration of the whole family was prepared for Sunday.
The celebrations started on Eno Church Hill at 10 am at the family fair, after which Karelian table offerings have been available at Eno Parish Hall.
The church was full.
517 people took part in the family fair.
The vicar of Eno, Armi Rautavuori, was glad that so many people had come to church.
It will be a great joy for a long time to come and will give strength to the work, "Rautavuori (pictured) says.
The fire at Kiihtelysvaara Church has touched many and was not ignored at the 200th anniversary of the church in Eno.
Eno Church is now the oldest in Joensuu Evangelical Lutheran parishes after Kiihtelysvaara Church was destroyed by fire.
Kiihtelysvaara wooden church was completed in 1770.
In the morning, a devotion was held to silence and commemorate the church destroyed by the fire.
Photos and videos: Medican glimpsed his power in Greece - The sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A strong hurricane-type autumn storm surged from southwest to Greece on Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medican, has been named Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red weather warning for the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades and Crete.
Images taken from the area show plenty of flooding around Greece.
A video posted on Twitter shows how a river has suddenly appeared between houses in the city of Kiato in the Corinthian region, rather than on the street, due to flooding.
Another video shows how the car has been driven by floodwaters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese peninsula, strong winds caused strong shipping.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens instructs people on its Facebook page to prepare for the storm in Greece.
The Delegation calls for monitoring of weather reports and local authority guidelines.
A Mediterranean hurricane, or medican, brings heavy rainfall and even the risk of flooding.
According to CNN, according to a study published in 2011, medicans occur only once or twice a year worldwide, typically around September and October, when sea temperatures are still high.
The storm now blowing left a trail of flooding in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey north and towards Europe.
Concerns have also been raised in Greece about refugee camps on islands such as Lesbos.
The thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in the camps have limited access to proper shelter.
Areas devastated by wildfires around Athens will also remain under the storm in the summer.
The medican also raged in Greece last November.
It was the opposite of the world I came from - which called for adaptation and where Donnat ruled.

We should not go to the sea now, but flights are still on schedule - thousands of Finns are currently holidaying on the Greek islands threatened by the autumn storm
Excursions to the sea are cancelled and you should be careful not to fly branches or other bulk goods in a storm.
Such guides have been distributed to more than 3,500 Finns holidaying through Aurinkomatkat in Greece over the weekend.
The instructions are needed, as even Hurricane Zorbas is predicted to hit the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, near the island of Crete, wind speeds can reach up to 45 metres per second in gusts.
Heavy rainfall increases the misery of the weather.
Anyone travelling to Greece from Finland via Aurinkomatkat and Tui who has reported their phone number has been warned of high winds by SMS, according to tour operators.
Still in the air sun and heat
According to Inka Ikonen, a solar travel communications expert, the worst has been avoided at resorts by early evening on Saturday.
For example, flights have landed and boarded according to the normal schedule.
Of course, we are monitoring the situation all the time.
Safety is ahead of us.
Antonia Schroderus, the media spokeswoman for Tui, says that their flights have also been on schedule.
We are in constant contact with our staff at the site.
At least Crete was still calm, he reported in the early evening on Saturday.
The most popular Greek islands, Rhodes and Crete, currently have a total of over 1,500 Finnish passengers.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are holidaying in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos is expected to reach Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon the sun had broken down in Rhodes and the temperature climbed to 27 degrees Celsius, "says Ikonen of Aurinkomatkat.
It is estimated that Zorbas will become the next Turkish nuisance, albeit with some relaxation.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and have checked the number of Finns flying to Antalya at Tui, for example, "says Schroderus.

Shirly Karvis and Janni Hussi have identical evening costumes in the mission final - this is how they react to the situation
Media personality and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Finland final on Saturday in an open-back evening dress.
Hussi says she bought the dress from Meslew.
I went to the shop and decided to trust the professionals who found me a great suit for this evening, "Hussi smiles.
Exactly the same silver evening dress had also been chosen by presenter Shirly Karvinen.

There has been so much haste that Karvinen arrived at the finals directly from a Finnair flight.
I made up and put my hair on the machine.
This is the glamour.
Changing the evening dress at home, Karvinen laughs.
Karvinen says he has pulled out his makeup among pensioners.
Indeed, his preparation also attracted the attention of fellow passengers.
I had a big mirror and saw people's eyes in the mirror.
My makeup was amusing, at least for others.

Two robot cars start operating in Espoo
They will operate for the rest of the year and pick up passengers, the City of Espoo informs.
Otaniemi robot cars will play the role of bus simulator, as traffic in the area is expected to start by robot bus next spring.
The project will develop and pilot year-round robot vehicle traffic and test the technical functionality of vehicles in Finnish conditions.
The experiment will show how robot cars fare on the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, "says Johanna Nyberg, Traffic Management Manager.
For the first time, robot cars will travel completely automatically among other traffic without any special traffic arrangements.
The safety of vehicles is always the responsibility of the auxiliary passenger on board.
Vehicles sense their surroundings all the time with several different sensors and assess whether the driveway is free.
If not, they will interpret whether the obstacle detected is a vehicle, a bicycle or, for example, a snowflake, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, which is responsible for developing robot traffic.
Robot cars run all autumn three days a week: Tuesdays from 1 p.m. to 3.30 p.m., Wednesdays from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. and Thursdays from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Robot cars stop at six stops along the route and pick up passengers.

Police monitored hunting in North Karelia and Savo
The Police Department of Eastern Finland carried out hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday with Metsähallitus and the Finnish Game Centre in North Karelia and Upper Savo, the Police Department's wilderness liaison officers reported on social media on Saturday.
The main focus of the controls was on the legality and authorisation of hunting.
Each hunter was checked for a hunting licence and a hunting permit required on state land.
In addition, licences for the possession of hunting weapons and the permitted quantities of self-loading weapons used in chicken birds were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the surveillance and only one hunter was found who lacked the required hunting licence.
The hunter was fined 12 days for unauthorised fishing.
In addition, 133 vehicle drivers were blown by the police and two of them are suspected of drunken driving.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic offences in a fine procedure, police times.
To sum up, hunters comply very well with the authorisation of hunting.
Many hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
One hunter noted that "I have been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone has checked permits."
The Police Department of Eastern Finland will continue hunting surveillance in the autumn together with other surveillance authorities.

In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be in a particularly vulnerable position in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, people with disabilities and the sick, women and children.
More people are elected to the group coming to Finland than there are in the quota, because in practice some are not arriving for various reasons.
Mykkänen will also meet Turkish Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu and NGOs on the Syrian border during his trip.
Ilkka Salmi, Chancellor of the Ministry of the Interior, will also take part in the trip.
Quota increase talked about
Finland has been taking quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
For a couple of years, the quota was 1,050 per year, but there has since been no agreement in the government to increase it.
The Coalition Party has been in favour of increasing the quota, but the project has most recently fallen into blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) recently proposed a gradual increase in the quota to between 1 500 and 2 000 people per year.
Mykkänen's visit will be the first under this government to be made on the ground by the interior minister to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The previous Interior Ministers Petteri Orpo and Paula Risikko had time to take up their new duties before the visits could be arranged.
Finland receives EUR 10 000 from the EU for every particularly vulnerable refugee.
In any case, it was so important that the messenger had to be killed.
"Obsessed with your own body." What does that mean?

Now we go astray - we no longer know whether to cry or laugh
Karjalainen reported last Saturday on a bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act.
The article gave the impression that the bill in principle prohibits the keeping of all animals not specifically authorised by ministerial decrees as farm animals, pets or otherwise in connection with business activities.
In other words, everything else is, in principle, prohibited except the animals specifically mentioned in the regulation.
If the bill ends up as law, it should mean that we are abandoning the general principle in Western democracies that the law specifically prohibits activities that endanger the security or good manners of society.
In principle, a ban is now being imposed on all activities that are not expressly authorised by law or regulation.
The change means that nothing new can be tried in business, for example, and nothing else can be done until the law or regulation adopting it has been adopted.
The government's performance in drafting legislation in general has been weak.
If we now go down the road that, in principle, everything is forbidden in Finland, which is not expressly allowed, we no longer know whether we are crying or laughing.
I have no doubt that the Animal Welfare Act requires an update.
But a bill along these lines is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I am not very familiar with the Constitution, but I wonder whether it will accept this' everything is forbidden, which is not expressly permitted by law or regulation '.
Hopefully there will be some sensible minister who will suspend such a bill.
The point shows the key estimate, and the line shows the uncertainty of the 95% confidence interval.
The best possible answer would be a ticket - for something that certainly happens in a certain place at a certain time.

Baby Alexia, 3 months, gracefully breaks Jere's lap
The Karalahti family photo focuses attention on the sweet three-month-old baby Alexia.
Nanna Karalahti tells about the Genuine kindergarten established in Kerava.
Sports entrepreneur Nanna Karalahti, 30, and ex-ice hockey player Jere Karalahti, 43, received a family addition at the beginning of July.
The couple's firstborn son Jax turned 2 in May, while little Alexia is only a three-month-old baby.
Nanna Karalahti recently held a training camp with Martina Aitolehti in Marbella, Spain, with the whole Karalahti family.
Nanna posted a picture of the atmosphere in Spain on Instagram, posing for the whole Karalahti family.

Turkey urged to charge mobile phones in case of storm
Storm Zorba, which blew in Greece on Saturday, is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
Meteorologists warned sailors, fishermen and farmers on the country's west coast in particular on Saturday about the storm in Greece, writes CNN Türk.
The tropical storm is reported to move along the coast from south to north during the day.
In the early evening on Saturday, disaster and emergency officials urged citizens to charge their mobile phones before the storm and ensure internet access works so people can get current status updates, according to local news agency Anadolu Ajansi.
People have been advised to stay at home and away from windows and to move garden furniture out of the way of the wind, for example.
Heavy rain is expected in Turkey and wind is expected to blow 28-33 metres per second.
Red weather warning in Greece
On Saturday, the Greek Meteorological Service issued a red weather warning for southern Greece for the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades and Crete.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and travel agents organising trips to Greece warned Finns in Greece about storm Zorba.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens also published a storm warning.
Travellers were advised to follow weather reports and instructions from local authorities.

Kimi Räikkönen summed up the reason for Mercedes' superiority over Ferrari
Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen was allowed to admit that the worst competitor Mercedes was too hard a piece in Russian gp time.
However, there is no reason to panic in the Ferrari camp, according to an experienced driver.
They were just quicker than us, but nothing huge is at stake.
Our car was the best in time all weekend so far, but they were just too fast, fourth driven and Räikkönen, who clearly missed Mercedes speed with his team mate Sebastian Vetteli, said.
Ferrari already had a difficult time in the previous race in Singapore.
Räikkönen was asked what the reason for the sudden fall from Mercedes was.
They seem to be going faster than us - that's how simple it is.
If I knew the reason for that, we would probably go at the same rate as them.
However, I know no more than anyone else.
This is perpetual guesswork and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In time we saw a rare treat for Räikkönen's upcoming stable Sauber.
Charles Leclerc, who will replace Räikkönen with Ferrari next season, was seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also reached the last qualifying session.
For Swedish drivers, the tenth starting position is the best in more than three years.
And even though no fewer than five drivers did not drive at all in the second driving session, the end result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging for Räikkönen for the future?
Yes, if you compare where they were in the early part of the season, then the step forward has been a big one.
Next year there will be a different story, so let's see, let's see.

That was it - Robert Helenius knocked Erkan Teperi out: "Robbe is back"
The match between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper in the evening in Stuttgart progressed steadily.
The German was a more proactive party in the ring, but he did not get a decent hit.
Helenius, who is clearly more far-reaching, controlled the match with his hard series, which found their way well.
The Finn was also in clearly better physical condition than Teper.
The solution finally came in the eighth period, when Helenius knocked Teper straight on the left.
The hit was so hard that the blacksmith in front of the home crowd didn't even try to get up from the carpet.
When the victory was confirmed, Helenius ventilated quite moderately.
In the ring interview, he initially praised the good atmosphere created by the audience and his opponent.
Then he changed his language to Finnish for a moment.
Thank you to all the viewers and Finnish cheers.
We were included in the belt today.
Helenius was delighted immediately after the match.
It was a really big victory for Helenius's career.
It might even be possible to get to the World Cup match, Helenius commented to the Evening Journal before the match.
Defeat, on the other hand, might have ended the entire boxing career.
Of course it has come to mind.

Indonesia disaster casualty toll could multiply
According to The Guardian, the Vice-President of the country calls for a clear increase in the number of victims.
According to the country's Vice-President, Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims could reach thousands.
Difficult circumstances
Rescuers are searching for those trapped, as well as the deceased, in the hardest-hit areas of the island of Sulawesi: the port city of Palun as well as neighbouring Donggala.
So far, all the victims are from Palu, the situation in Donggala is not yet clear.
Hundreds of people are missing and around 540 have been badly injured.
There are still people in collapsed buildings who rescuers have been unable to get out.
For example, a hotel called Roa Roa in Palu has collapsed.
Rescuers say they have heard screams from people trapped in the rubble, but a lack of clearing equipment has delayed the start of rescue work.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has ordered the army to be rescued and cleared.

Miss Finland finalist's hesitant response and long reflection caused laughter
Billnäs Ruukki is currently selecting a new Miss Finland.
In a round of interviews, each mission finalist was asked a question.
The finalists pulled the question of a glass bowl on stage.
In particular, the hesitant response of finalist number six Emilia Anttikoski, 23, caused sweet but benevolent laughs in the audience present.
The question put to Anttikoski was customs duties via Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what is the latest book that the mission finalist has read.
Anttikoski thought about his answer for a good while before starting with hesitation.
Thank you for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The latest book I've read is..., "Anttikoski said, thinking.
The pause for reflection caused laughter in the audience until Anttikoski continued his response:
The last book I have read is...
I have read books at school!
Surely something related to economics.
So the last book I've read is economics someone, Anttikoski replied.
After his answer, Anttikoski received loud applause from the audience accompanied by laughter.
Earlier on the mission tour, Anttikoski attracted attention because he did not want to pose in underwear because of his principle.

Status symbols do not attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney who have analysed the issue have outlined two types of "coolism" with slightly different characteristics: generally attractive coolism and partly opposing dissident coolism.
Charmingly, according to the researchers' description, cool people had many socially desirable traits: they were outward-looking, friendly, amicable and competent.
Dissidents, on the other hand, were characterised by distance, independence, rebellion and edge.
They thirsted for experience and paid little attention to the assessments of outsiders.
Both types were united by good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
Kovis's role is not cool in the long run: high status in teens does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is according to a US study published in Child Development in 2014.
Young people who socialized early, party, sought good-looking crowds and sought the popularity of others, had an increased risk of substance abuse and crime as young adults.
In their relationships, they fared less well than their once more discreet peers.
Wolf cars, designer bags or watches that communicate high status do not make a person cool - or at least genuinely attractive company.
In a study published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, the vast majority of people were more prepared to make friends with a regular supermarket shirt than with those dressed in a designer shirt - despite the fact that most people chose to wear a designer shirt when they got to know them.

A cyclone is hitting it - a weather warning is shouting red
Over the weekend, as much water could fall in southern Greece as in Finland on average over six months.
Hurricane Zorbas will hit Greece over the weekend.
Be prepared if you are staying in the Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens announces it on its Facebook page.
According to the major approach, the Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red weather warning for the regions.
The approaching storm is also reported on the weather service Foreca's blog.
It says the storm's toughest gusts are up to 45 metres per second.
By comparison, storm Kuisma, which hit Finland at the beginning of the week, blew over 31 metres per second at its toughest.
According to the blog, however, the main concern of storm Zorbas is not wind, but heavy rainfall.
Over the weekend, more than 300 millimetres of water could arrive in southern Greece.
This is equivalent to about half of Finland's annual rainfall.
Weather service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video of the storm developing on its Facebook page.
Storm Zorbas has caused flooding in Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.

Valtteri Bottas shook and chewed adrenaline in Sochi - will he be Hamilton's helper on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas shook a little more dozens of minutes after his pole position in the Russian gp when he was in front of the media.
A great lap left behind Mercedes number one star Lewis Hamilton and was certainly mentally important for the Finnish driver who collected criticism this season.
A nice round.
I do not know what happened to Lewis when he left the round of solutions unfinished.
It feels good, shaking a bit even more, Bottas explained.
I have only been on pole once this year, in Austria (in the middle of summer), so quite a bit of time has passed.
This track has been good for me in the past, and I got good laps again.
It's not easy to skip the Sochi track, so departure plays a particularly big role.
And of course Bottas was allowed to answer the question of whether he would drive for victory tomorrow or whether Hamilton, who is approaching the World Cup title, would be jealous.
My starting point for the race is definitely that I'm trying to win.
There can be no other goal when leaving the pole, Bottas balked.
But as a stable we are fighting for both championships.
Lewis "management of Sebastian Vettel is quite big and the difference with me is very big, so keep that in mind.
Let's see what happens, however, Bottas added.
Hamilton was genuinely delighted with the success of Bottas after driving, and Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff also tasted good.
Lewis had the intention of beating Valtteri, but he did not succeed in a stoppage bend.
Valtteri knows he has to tear everything out of himself to beat Lewis.
And he was so charged that adrenaline burst out of his ears, Wolff glowed.
Asked whether the stable would allow Bottas and Hamilton to drive fairly, Wolff answered dodging.
We will discuss tomorrow morning and see how the race leaves.

Kiteeläinen Erno Kinnunen won the Finnish Rally Championship
The Finnish Rally Championship series ended rarely.
Hardly ever before have the brothers ended up as Finnish champions at the same time.
Now Eerik and Henrik Pietarinen did it in the final rally around Turku and Salo, as Eerik won SM1 and Henrik SM2.
Kiteeläinen Erno Kinnunen secured the best achievement of his career when third place in the final race sealed him the Finnish championship in the SM4 class of two-wheel drive cars.
Kinnunen and co-driver Ville Mäkelä, who competed in Honda Civic, started the Turku event with composure because the starting points were clear: ranking in the top group would guarantee the Finnish Championship title.
In the darkness of Friday night, the duo had to compensate when some of the additional lights failed in the second special stage.

Syria calls on US, France and Turkey to withdraw troops
Syria's foreign minister is calling on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem says foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and unconditionally.
Muallem said foreign troops were in Syria fighting terrorism, and he said the war on terrorists was "almost over."
In his UN speech, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return home.
However, there is no end to seven years of war.

Not quite the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court judge drama on TV
Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who is standing for the Supreme Court, and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses him of harassment, got an extraordinary number of people around the screens.
In the United States, the full-blown Supreme Court judge nomination drama brought at least 20 million people to their televisions on Thursday.
At the time, Kavanaugh, appointed by Donald Trump, and Blasey Ford, a California professor accusing him of harassment, were before the Senate Judiciary Committee to tell their story.
According to preliminary results, the hearings were followed by a total of 20.4 million viewers on six main channels: ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
In addition to them, several million more followed the online consultation.
NBC reported that 6.8 million people watched the live streaming and CNN reported that it had set its record for the year with 8.2 million live broadcasts.
CNN's figure rises to more than 10 million when those who followed the broadcast via Youtube and Facebook are included.
Fox News Digital also reached 8.0 million starts.
Digital starts are channels "own, TV viewing figures come from Nielsen, a research and data analysis company.
Nielsen will release the final readings on Monday, but they are soaring anyway.
Few reach 20 million
More than 20 million viewers in the United States usually only have access to sports matches and the major Oscar and Grammy gala in the entertainment world, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches and, in 2016, presidential debates.
Of course, it is a long way from the US's most watched annual programme, the American Football League NFL final match to the Super Bowl.
This year, the Super Bowl gathered about 103 million people around the screens on NBC.
Last year, according to Nielsen, nearly 48 million people watched Trump's first speech to Congress and more than 30 million people watched the inauguration.
An extremely important issue
The Supreme Court's nomination of judges is an extremely significant case in the United States, as the posts are for life.
Trump was already able to appoint one new judge when Antonin Scalia passed away in early 2016 and Republicans managed to prevent then-President Barack Obama from appointing a successor to him.
The second seat opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but on several issues he was a so-called scales language whose vote could determine the position of the nine-member court.
He was a supporter of the right to abortion and the rights of sexual minorities and, for example, ruled in 2015 with his vote that same-sex people were granted the right to marry throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is far more conservative in his positions.
His election to the Supreme Court could lock in the court's conservative supremacy for decades.

Children have the right to access their information to parents
Only parents of children under the age of 10 can see their children's health information from the Loyalty Service.
It is a big problem, it is wrong and it is strange.
Originally, of course, the situation with the Loyalty Service was even more worrying: parents were not even able to see the health information or recipes of the little ones.
A correction described as temporary was made in autumn 2016 for persons aged under 10.
Since then, there have been promises to correct practices, but it has taken an astonishing amount of time to do so.

In the United States, the FBI started gutting harassment accusations against Kavanaugh
According to American media, the FBI is investigating harassment allegations made by at least two women.
One of the women was before the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this week.
Kavanaugh has denied accusations of alleged sexual harassment during his studies.
US President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the accusations at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The investigation shall not exceed one week.
According to the Washington Post, this is a more limited investigation than a criminal investigation and may not become public.

Aid agencies are preparing to start work in Sulawesi, Indonesia - "Clean water is the most urgent"
The UN children's organisation UNICEF and other international aid organisations are ready to help on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, "says Kirsi Haru, Head of Information at UNICEF in Finland.
The local authorities are leading the rescue work, but the need for further assistance is already evident at this stage.
UNICEF operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, Unicef always has a full emergency response capability, "says Haru.
The first task now is to find people in ruins, both survivors and dead.
In the city of Palun, Sulawesi, rescue operations are ongoing, but in the Donggala region a little further north the situation is less clear.
There are still places where connections are not working.
Aid measures are difficult because the roads are also crossed, "says Haru.
Buildings in Sulawesi are often lightweight, so the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami is great.
Once the survivors have been found, they need shelter - tents at first, for example - and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
First of all, it is usually possible to offer people water purification tablets, which Unicef also has in stock.
Efforts are being made to repair water systems as soon as possible, but in the event of an emergency, water is being transported by trucks, for example.
In crisis situations, many children are separated from their parents.
The search for family members and family reunification is one part of UNICEF's remit.

Billionaire Elon Musk quits as Tesla board chairman - $20 million fine for tweets
Elon Musk, founder of companies that make space rockets and electric cars, avoids fraud charges under a deal with the U.S. Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk will quit his role as chairman of the board of directors of electric car company Tesla and agree to a $20 million fine.
Musk is stepping down as part of a deal he struck with the U.S. Securities Market Supervisory Authority.
By agreeing Musk will avoid fraud charges.
Musk was threatened with securities fraud by the U.S. Securities Commission SEC over tweets he sent in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing to withdraw Tesla, an electric car company, from the stock exchange, which caused the company's share price to rise rapidly.
Under the agreement, Musk will not be allowed to chair Tesla's board for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new "independent member" to its board and take on two "independent directors" in its management team.
Tesla must also set up a committee to oversee Musk's communications.
Musk is still allowed to continue as Tesla's CEO.
In addition to Musk's personal fines of $20 million, Tesla will also have to pay a similar fine of $20 million to the financial supervisor.
Tweets misled investors
According to the SEC, Musk's tweets misled investors and Tesla shareholders.
Musk claimed he would have secured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange as a private limited liability company.
According to the billionaire's tweets, the company would have been bought off the stock exchange for a share price of $420.
Tesla's share price rose by more than ten per cent a day after the tweets, but later fell.
According to the SEC, Musk's claims had no basis whatsoever.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated the funding he claimed.
He had also not discussed withdrawing from the stock exchange with the rest of the management team or the company's board of directors.
On Friday this week, the rate dropped 14 percent when the securities supervisor SEC announced a fraud charge.
The news of the agreement is expected to strengthen the company's course again.

At the same time, Jamsen confirms something already mentioned by the Church in Helsinki Twitter account.
The account mentions that the last judgment is not the reason for the clock to stop.
Jamsen says the church bells aren't ringing because of the fault.
