Eemeli Kouki led the Hurricane home win - Savo Volley won second
Hurricane-Loimaa, who played seven times in a row in the men's volleyball championship medals, started home in 2018-19 with Raisio's Loimu on Saturday 3-0.
Eemeli Kouki, a general player who returned from Romania to Finland, was the most effective Hurricane with 22 points.
There were some excitement abroad, but they didn't happen, and then a call came from Loima.
It was time to get things done quickly, Kouki said.
Similarly, Tomi Rumpunen's support for Koukia was 18 points.
The most powerful of the guests was Samuli Kaislasalo, a team leader with 17 points per match.
The win of the opening game is always important.
Many players had experience with their counterparts, and brought an extra coin to the game.
Our game is not ready yet, but the continuation of the medal tube is of course the goal, Kouki said.
I think Savo Volley is the most effective
With 18 points, Miro Määttänen was the most powerful at Savo Volley when the team poured out 3-0 at Vantaa in Vantaa.
Our game was volatile, especially at the end of the attack, but luckily we got a squeeze.
At least I had no conscious different downloads when I played against my former team, Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in Vieremä's Volleyball in the 3 rd season 2000-01, scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with many things.
The hall was small, the atmosphere on the roof all the time.
Good feeling was left at home.
Miro was a lady, he played a good game, Tuovinen said.
Siltala's previous season in the league was 2006-07, then he won the silver medal in Pielavesi Sammo when Tuovinen was still the head coach.
Thiago Maciel was Ducks' most powerful 14 points.
Mikkonen is again the star of Akaa-Volley
During the season 2012-13, Joni Mikkonen, the winner of the league, has also started this season strongly.
The chipper scored 25 points when Akaa-Volley took his season opening victory after killing Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has started quite well on its own.
There was, of course, a loss today, because we were the fourth in a loss of 17-21.
There was a dive for some boom, and the fifth batch came at the same time, Mikkonen said.
A few years ago, the most effective Tigers in the finals were 28-point editor Edward Buivids.
Countryman Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs supported with 17 points.
There was hardly any grip on the guy's chipper, Mikkonen praised.
- Survive the boy, this is not a execution but an instruction.
Finland is the number one in the world of human capital
Finland is at the top of the world in the comparison of human capital, says Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital between 1990 and 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years Finland was the number one in statistics.
In 2016, the top whiskey was almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Finland, followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, the Netherlands ranked one higher and Taiwan was found on the list instead of Canada.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan ranked the worst.
Human capital is measured by the level of education of the population, access to education, skills and health.
The World Bank has set human capital in the context of economic growth.

Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois kept the Atleticon in check, the local game ended in a goalless finish
The Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois pulled out for a fantastic fight, and the Madrid team's local game ended in an unpaid draw late on Saturday in the Spanish Football League.

In the US, abortion is now being attacked - A powerful document tells us why
The US Senate is currently trying to find out whether one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could elect Brett Kavanaugh, nominated by President Donald Trump.
In the Republican Party, many hope that Kavanaugh's decisive voice would overcome the decision known as Roe against Wade, which made legal abortion in the US in 1973.
The documentary film Reversing Roe by the Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg, USA and abortion rights, shows how the current situation has come over the years.
As incredible as it seems, the topic is also topical in Finland.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (sin) has done publicity work against safe abortion and received varying degrees of support from most of our country's MPs.
At the beginning of a powerful documentary, Gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has been the only abortion doctor in the state of Missouri, is being found.
The armed guard of the clinic says he defends US religious freedom.
News videos remind us of the deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
Going to the time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the Lutheran Churchmen led women to reliable abortion doctors.
The reasoning of the interviewed pastor is good, but really they are not even needed, a photograph of a woman who died of abortion is enough.
There were about 5,000 deaths in the US each year.
In particular, the Republican Party defended the legalization of abortions.
Already in 1967, California's Abortion Law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, Reagan, in his presidential election campaign in 1980, began to turn the religion into politics to turn the voters into a flip-flop.
Her abductor, George Bush, also spun his abortion.
And so did Donald Trump.
At the heart of the matter, the documentary reaches out for the underlying cause of the politicization of abortion.
When they were denied tax exemption from religious organizations that favor racial segregation, they became politically active.
Abortion was chosen as sticky horse.
Religion has brought extraordinary knots to politics.
At the time of writing in the US, there is a situation where the president, boasting sexual harassment but abused by the voice of the religious right, has chosen Kavanaugh as a candidate for the Supreme Court, which many women now accuse of sexual harassment.
Kavanaugh can gain power based on the balance of language, deciding on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.

Israeli army fired seven Palestinians, including two children - at the border with large demonstrations
Around 200 Palestinians have been killed in half a year when Israel has fired demonstrators in the border zone.
Israeli soldiers fired seven Palestinians on Friday in the Gaza Strip, says Palestinian Ministry of Health.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, there are two children among the dead: 12- and 14-year-old boys.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
Of these, 89 were injured in the bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened the fire and made an air strike in the border zone when the protesters threw rocks and explosives at the Israeli forces.
The army says that it has begun to use force, so that the protesters do not break the border fence or strive to the other side.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in the Gaza demonstrations since March, when the Palestinians began their weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the wounded are 12,000.
Demonstrators demand access for Palestinian families to areas where the Palestinians were forced to leave when the State of Israel was founded in 1948.

The Pedophile Assistance Service was immediately filled out of reservations - in Finland, about 40,000 are interested in children
It is estimated that 2% of men and a small proportion of women experience at least some sexual interest in their brochures.

To date, it has been difficult for children or young people who are sexually interested in getting help.

Korean leaders or Congolese gynecologist?
US President Donald Trump wins the Nobel Peace Prize - the idea may sound strange, but Trump is one of the biggest favorites on the basis of betting odds.
In the background, Trump's role in getting North Korea at least at speech level is to commit to nuclear disarmament.
The biggest favorites for the Nobel Peace Prize winners are the South Korean President Moon Jae-in and the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have met three times this year and pledged to seek a peace agreement between their countries.
The warming of the baskets is remarkable, as last year the gaps were good.
Yet, for years, rewarding Kimi, who has been threatening for years with nuclear weapons and leading his country with iron, would undoubtedly raise criticism.
Nobel prize winners will be announced since Monday, and Friday will be the most rewarding, peace prize.
If the prize is not given to the Korean Peninsula diplomat, one of the top-ranked Congolese physician Denis Mukwege.
The prestigious gynecologist has thousands of women who have been victims of rape in his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has become a world leader in their field.
With his work, Mukwege has drawn attention to sexual violence, a by-product of many conflicts.
The United Nations Organization for Refugees, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been considered a strong candidate.
The Nobel Committee has said that this year, 331 candidates will be awarded the prize.
The names of the candidates will not be disclosed to the public.
Trump himself would not mind if the Nobel would get.
In May, the reporter asked him at the White House, whether he thought he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks, but I would never say it, Trump said with a smile.
I want to get this done.
The award I want is a victory for the whole world, the President continued referring to the North Korean talks.
However, there are things that make Trump's Nobel unlikely.
The award-winning Norwegian Nobel Committee has often given recognition to individuals and organizations representing liberal democracy and a multi-polar world order - just the kind of international cooperation that Trump has seen as an opponent.
In the 21st century, three American politicians, all of them Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, and Barack Obama in 2009, received the prize.
Trump's reward would therefore require a Nobel Committee's ideological full turn.
Tony has been the only bright point otherwise in a tough day.

Fire announcement in the tunnel: Motorists behaved like a fiddler and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos at Ykköstie, Lohja, took place on 8 September.
Due to the announcement, the traffic in the tunnel area was cut in the direction of both Turku and Helsinki.
When it turned out that it was a system failure, the fire department tried to make the traffic normal.
However, it didn't work very fast.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Center said it could not be opened because the road was shocked by the motorists and they were driving how the hell was happening.
The motorway was then driven in the wrong direction only after a short wait.
When the first one starts working against traffic rules, a few others are often followed, Tapennet Heiskanen, Communications Manager at Liikenneturva, is amazed.
According to traffic regulations, motorways and tunnels must not stop for a compelling reason.
Liikenneturva points out that in exceptional situations, it is not possible to endanger traffic with hasty solutions.
Alarm vehicles must always be given as unobstructed access as possible.
Driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is especially prohibited, as is the u-turn and cancellation.
The same bans are also valid in tunnels, where you also have to turn on headlights.
Stopping without a compelling reason is also prohibited, as is the case with parking.
Recently, there have been cases where the driver has stopped in the tunnel to brush Lumia from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this activity, Heiskanen says in the newsletter of Liikenneturva.

Ilves fans would have liked to continue to celebrate even though the ship was caught in the lake
Inland waterway vessel M / S The Ilves fans carried by Tampere would have liked to remain on the ship to continue their victory celebrations, even though the ship had stuck to the bottom of the lake, says Juho Syrjä, the ship's chief at the time.
M / S Tampere, who had traveled from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, departed from his route late on Saturday night and stuck on his bow at Vanajavesi in Aka.
19 passengers and five crew members were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one was hurt in the bud.
The Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party on the ship until the morning, but it was more sensible to send them to the harbor by the fire department and take the bus home, Syrja told the STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna following Ilves and HPK's match, which ended with Ilves's 4-3 victory.
According to Syrjan, Haveri on Saturday was due to the fact that the surface of the water in Vanajavesi was about half a meter lower than normal.
Navigation was also hampered by the fact that the closest bus sign was covered by log gaps, which is why its reflectors did not normally appear in the dark autumn evening.
No more noticeable collision
Haveri happened on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalmi shortly after the ship's route had fallen below the motorway bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
The greater drama of the incident was not associated with Syrjan, as the speed of the ship was very low at the time of the incident and the bottom hit did not cause a more significant collision.
According to the sailor, catching the bottom has not caused any leaks or wrecks on the ship, and the ship's cruises will continue normally.
The diver went on Saturday morning to check the ship's condition before the ship was towed off the low tide.
For the sake of certainty, we are still looking at the shipyard to check that this has not caused any damage, says Syrjä.
Syrja believes that M / S Tampere's next cruise next weekend can be arranged as agreed.
The cruise season of the ship continues according to him until the Independence Day.
No use for ambulances
The rescue service received an alarm on Saturday evening a little over half past twelve.
The port of Viia was alerted to ambulances to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
The late-night fireman Matti Willman told late in the evening that the evacuation conditions on the lake were awkward due to darkness and rather hard wind.
The Pirkanmaa Rescue Service announced half an afternoon on Sunday that all those on board had been evacuated and passengers had been transferred by bus to Tampere.
Built in 1957, the cruise ship has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Trump Judge, accused of harassment and suicide, may miss the top job
Brett Kavanaugh, a US Supreme Court judge, may well miss his job, says Program Director Mika Aaltola from the Institute for International Affairs.
To date, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior during their studies.
According to Aaltola, the doubts have brought the Republican Party so much political pressure that President Donald Trump may end up in another person.
Occasionally, in the United States, it has happened from time to time that the presidential candidate for the Supreme Court judge has raised a lot of controversy.
In this case, the judge is usually withdrawn, says Aaltola.
This is how the president has been able to maintain his face.
The appointment would fall into the Democrats' laar
The US Supreme Court is trying to be above politics, but at least in Kavanaugh's case, the election of a new judge has become a politically sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, Aaltola says that the decision will probably rally to the Democratic Party in the upcoming Intervals of Congress.
It would raise voter turnout among young people and women who would be more likely to vote for democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
There is no chance for an appointment for every presidential term, because in the United States, the Supreme Court judges are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their request at about 70-80 years of age.
Some Republicans also hesitate to name
The US Supreme Court judges are nominated for a regular background check, says Aaltola.
Although Trump has only set a deadline of one week for further analysis by the FBI, it may still point out something essential according to Aaltola.
Yes it may bring.
There is rarely smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, at least it is certain that the suitability or inappropriateness of Kavanaugh will still be discussed vigorously before the Senate makes its decision.
The Republicans have a majority in the Senate with 51-49, but at least two female Republican Senators are thought to be skeptical about Kavanaugh's appointment.
The most embarrassing thing would be that the name would be put to the vote and the Republicans would lose.

The woman identified the Salisbury suspect as a military intelligence agent
The Russian woman has told the BBC the BBC to recognize a Russian man suspected of poisoning Salisbury as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service.
The woman said, based on the photos, that it was a military inquiry with Anatoly Tshep, who worked at GRU.
The Internet community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia previously reported that they had revealed one of the men suspected of poisoning to Tshepiga.
Earlier, they said they had found evidence that men's current identities are masked identities.
The BBC Group traveled to the Far East, near the Russian-Chinese border, where Tshepiga grew up.
A woman living in the village recognized the young pictures published by Chhepigan Bellingcat.
He recognized the same man in British police pictures of Ruslan Boshirov himself as a calling man today.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning the former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with Novitshok nerve poison in March.
Scripts survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been awarded with the Russian hero badge in 2014 for example.
Russia continues to dispute the suspected GRU connection.
The men who had been suspected of poisoning had previously reported in September that they had been tourists in Salisbury in an interview with Russian TV.

Elderly throwing bags in sote reform
There is now a vivid example of what the Sipilä Board's sote-change reformer means in practice.
My birthplace Vaala sote-services are produced by the Municipality of Oulunkaari, which in 2016 has been appointed Attendo's former Regional Director.
The federal leaders warn the council of a change limiter.
If sote expenditures now rise, the municipal government aid will be cut in the future.
Municipal decision-makers were frightened, and most of them are ready for a major structural change in the care of the elderly, which would put an end to institutional care and a small memory unit for the health center.
Home health care would be increased, which means in Vaal for long distances, that the elderly living in the remote villages are teared off at the health center to be treated at home.
Attendo was confident that the municipality would pay its customers.
The left of Vaala did not swallow bad preparation, but organized a good public event, which attracted a lot of relatives, nurses and other party delegates.
I introduced the sot-provincial preparation slides to see how the elderly in Vaala are already being treated at home in Northern Ostrobothnia the most.
Carina Läntinen, a member of the neighboring municipality, was also present.
The local magazine made a big deal of the occasion, and it brought the preparers of the Oulunkaari back to their feet.
The Sote preparers do not write on any paper that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Vaala, which is now waiting for residents to be empty.
There are no other service providers.
The draftsmen only talk about the service voucher, but do not tell you what level of care it receives or what kind of personnel structure Attendo will take care of the elderly until aftercare.
Without a nurse?
Namely, the health care facilities are stopped because there is no doctor's night-time.
Attendo will also resort to doctors at the Vaala Health Center.
An example of Vaala tells us how central officials are running with inadequate information from authorized persons and the officers are pushed back against the wall with a change limiter.
In this way, the center party empties the inhabitants of Vaala, because who is left to live there voluntarily if there is a chance to change it.

Turkish President Erdogan opened the Grand Mosque in Cologne
Thousands of people in the city of Cologne in Germany pointed out when Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the visiting Turkish president, opened the largest mosque in Europe.
Several hundred people had gathered on the banks of the River Rhine from the morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read on the signs of the protesters, and fascism was condemned in the slogans.
Several demonstrations have been held during Erdogan's visit on Thursday and security measures have been rigorous.
In Cologne, some 10,000 people were expected in advance to protest, including the human rights situation in Turkey.
Erdogan's supporters had also gathered around the Grand Mosque.
However, the police had isolated a large area of the mosque for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised his successful visit to Germany and estimated it to have strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel vowed to rebuild their relations on Friday, which has deteriorated significantly since the 2016 attempted coup d'état in Turkey.
However, Merkel stressed that there were deep differences between the countries, including on human rights issues.
Review surrounds the visit
Both Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker and the North Rhine-Westphalia Prime Minister, Armin Laschet, withdrew their participation in the opening ceremony when the review of Erdogan's visit accelerated.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, said he had come to a demonstration against Switzerland on Erdogan.
I want to have a voice for those who cannot leave the streets in Turkey.
They have been arrested, killed and subjugated.
For Erdogan everything that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
At the last stage of Erdogan's trip to Germany, in North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant proportion of the population is of Turkish origin.

In Slovakia, three people have been accused of murdering journalist Jan Kuciak.

Kuciak was discovered in February with a fiancé from his home in Bratislava.
He had studied links between politicians and the Italian Mafia.

Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Journalist Arto Nyberg interviews Vesa Heilala today in her direct discussion program today.
Vesa is in the studio telling her about her upcoming space trip, which she already booked from Virgin Galactica in 2010.
The price came to EUR 151,000, which required a bank loan.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space long ago.
However, the departure has been postponed year by year.
Now it seems that after the unfortunate test flight that happened in 2014 and which killed the death, things are in the reel.
If everything goes well, commercial flights will begin this year or no later than next year.
The number of Vesa's flight is 300, so his journey takes about a year to the first departure.
The flight takes 2.5 hours and the weightless space is 5 minutes at 100 kilometers, the Finnish astronaut tells about the upcoming website.
At the same address, he is also the backbone of his longing for space.

Manchester City continued to defeat the run-up to the Premiership when it poured 2-0 on Brighton's Saturday home.

Sterling had a chance to take the lead on Leroy Sané's dazzling drive up the left, but the opportunity fizzled away as his shot went just over the bar after 30 minutes.
Agüero raised his own land balance to five when he saw Sterling with a piece of Brighton defeat at 65 minutes.
The Argentinean was able to place 2-0-Final Scores at the penalty spot easily.

Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikk and was amazed by Ferrari: "Losing a very important driver"
In an interview with Swiss journalist Blick, Mersu's British cat was asked if he believed that release of Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari would help Hamilton in the rest of the year.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second runner Sebastian Vetteli with 40 points.
Just under three weeks ago, Ferrari told reporters that Räikkönen would not continue in the garage next season and at the same time Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Of course, Hamilton does not believe that Räikkönen found gloves on the counter.
I don't think Kimi will change in the remaining races.

Soccer A-SM Championship Championship Full Fall: The opponent arrived with only 7 players
The highest level in football boys ends on Saturday, when the last round of the season is played.
The starting points for the championship round before 13 o'clock were clear: FC Lahti Academy has enough to practice against Vasa IFK in practice.
In order to turn the situation into the final round, the second Ilves of the Championship must win PK-35 and wish the Lions to lose.
However, in practice, the championship of the Lahti people was confirmed before the start, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been fewer Vassals, the match could not be started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
In the break, the Lahti people led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the Vassal player's racket is that the team has partly played the same players with the A-Series, ie the P20 series and the men's Kakkonen C-block.
In practice, Vasa IFK has played in Kakis against the fall of the whole season.
At the final round of Kakkonen on Saturday, Vasa IFK will be forced to win JBK in a guest match and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose its own guest match against KuFu in Toivala, Siilinjärvi.

Serena Williams is startled by the video she is singing with topless - campaigning for breast cancer awareness
The superstar of tennis, Serena Williams, shakes up again.
Now she is campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by publishing in her Instagram account a video in which she sings just her arms in front of her breasts, says AFP.
The song is the hit song I Touch Myself by Australian The Divinyls in 1991.
On video, Williams supports the Australian breast cancer association.
"I recorded The Divinyls' global hit to remind women to do regular breastfeeding checks," Williams writes in his Instagram message.
And yes, this put me in the discomfort, but I wanted to do it because the subject touches all women irrespective of skin color all over the world.
Early detection is all a and o - it scares many lives.
The second author of The Divinyls is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, made for Chrissy Amphlett.
"He died of breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first," Williams says.
The video has now been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was released early on Sunday morning.
In the comments of the video, Williams is praised for his courage.
Earlier this week, Williams left the Beijing Tennis Tournament.
In the background, there is an uproar in the US open tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams was fired at the main referee of the match and claimed, among other things, that men were much more abusive than female players.

Will tomorrow go to work in a small flu?
Here facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
Many do not want to stay home or not.
However, it is worthwhile to consider whether others should be infected because the disease can be contagious, even if the symptoms are small.
Occasionally, the symptoms of the flu suddenly strike, sometimes they appear in the creeps.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your own symptoms seem small, says Prevention.
So is it worth staying at home?
According to Prevention, the flu is contagious even when the person has no symptoms.
The virus is infected a day before the symptoms begin and from five days to a week thereafter.
Children may be ill for longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you should not be at school or at work.
You can go back to work when the cough breaks down and there is no fever anymore, says Professor of Medicine Gregory Poland.
You should also avoid training.
Returning too fast to the hall slows down recovery.
Also, remember to wash your hands, throw your handkerchiefs and throw the rags into the trash.
Sore, though?
If you have to leave your home, consider using a protective mask.
The mask does not control viruses, but keeps the user aware of the head area.
Then your fingers will not be placed in your nose or mouth, Poland says.
Sneezing is also limited to the mask.
How can you avoid infections?
The best way is still to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, the latter is difficult to avoid.
For example, in the United States, the average person touches his eyes, nose or mouth every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.

Lehter showed her inexperience, the playground is not sure yet
Jori Lehter's strong submarine play emerged when his NHL team Philadelphia Flyers played his last training match before the season began.
Philadelphia won Boston 4-1, and Lehter bounced Michael Rafflin twice in the goal.
In recent days, Lehter has been exposed to drug suspicion.

Lehter has denied having committed a crime.
The club and the player have discussed the issue and NHL is investigating the case.
Following the match, Sam Carchidi, who closely follows the Flyer magazine, estimates that Lehter belongs to a group of six attackers, five of whom will be in the NHL team.
According to Carchid, Lehter was excellent in the training match.
In the second installment, Lehterä fought the reel with his own power, pulled the defender and bounced to Raffl's open-space waiting in front of the goal.

The fresh picture shows the change: The strongest man in the world was losing dozens of pounds
Eddie Hall, crowned as the world's strongest man in 2017, is undergoing a striking deformation.
The British Eddie Hall hunted the world's strongest man for a long and determined time.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 kilocalories of food a day and, according to the Mirror magazine, weighed 200 pounds.
The shirts were 5XL in size.
Before admitting to winning the title, Hall admitted that he was injuring his body.
The human body has not been created to be this size, Hall said.
The British hunted the strongest man in the world for the victory by all means and the family man promised to end his career if he was awarded the title.
Hall didn't want her children to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise and was no longer seen in the April 2018 World's Strongest Man Race.
Recently, Hall released an image on Instagram where he posed a significant amount of active career in a slower condition.

Ex-Managers are demanding unpaid fees from Robert Helenius
The boxer Robert Helenius's evening match against Erkan Teperi is overshadowed by a wallet.
Ilta-Sanomat has today announced a punching challenge from a challenging application filed by Jaakko Helminen and Jussi Kokkila, a judge in charge of a total of over 80,000 euros of unpaid manager fees.
According to the challenge application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helen on April 15, 2014 to January 30, 2015.
We have tried to reconcile, but there is no alternative.
There has been a clear assignment here, and a lot of work has been done, says Kokkila for Ilta-Sanomat.
Helenius's current manager Markus Sundman sent a response to Iltalehti telling the events of the boxer's view.
Helenius denies being obliged to pay the required amount.
According to the response, Kokkila and Helminen had provided their services in a financially troubled situation for Helenus and promised to be able to arrange matches and sponsorship for him.
It was verbally agreed that Helenius would be obliged to pay only a percentage of his matches.
It was repeatedly assured that Helenius did not have to pay anything, only to receive the income they had arranged.
This is also normal and the only practice in the management of professional athletes.
Wage work has never been agreed and it would have been absurd in Helenius's situation, Sundman explains in his message.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
According to the response, Helenius would have wanted to agree on the distribution of income in writing from the start, but Kokkila and Sundman did not come up with the draft until the end of 2014.
He, for his part, said the proposal was poor and cut off cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius never took any time in dealing with Kokkila and Helminen.
One year after the end of the co-operation, Helenius was assigned an "unqualified but extensive" invoice for the manager's work.
This year, the same claims have been made.
Helenius regards Helminen's and Kokkila's posthumous activities as cowardly, saying in the response.
Today, Helenius faces the 7th Erkan Teper, the Seventh Heavy Series Challenge League, in Stuttgart.

A hearted man and a good supplier
Entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the deceased radio broadcaster and editor Erkki Pälli for decades.
Erkki Pälli, a long-range radio broadcaster and journalist, died at the age of 83 in incurable liver cancer.
The announcer's death statement was published on Sunday in Helsingin Sanomat.
The announcement tells Päll's dead on September 3rd.
Pälli told about a serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
At that time, the publication was also seen by Ile Vainio, who was saddened by the knowledge of the fate of the acquaintance.
He left on Facebook earlier as farewell, Ile Vainio says.
Vainio sees Erkki Pälli as a multi-talented expert who became a brilliant supplier.
He remembers Pällin being a man who had fast hoxotics and fun stuff.
I got to know Erk as a little boy when I first came to Finnlev at the age of 12 and started out as a stockman there.
Then we met Erk.
Then he was Finnlev's spokesman and in various positions, Ile Vainio recalls.
When I went to make music as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Pälli was a regular editor at all the festivals doing stuff from the artists.
He was always knowledgeable and saw how great he was in entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, she got directly into the skin of her interviewees.
He was a cordial man and a good supplier.
For many, he became a well-respected Yle radio broadcaster, but he also wrote great news articles.
Erkki interviewed me many times.
He was good to talk, Vainio praises.
Over the decades, Pälli worked in addition to supplier work at Fazer with Toivo Kärki.
He was a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir's albums.
However, Pällin's greatest passion was radio work, in which he had a unique style.
He did radio work since the 1960s, and he became familiar with numerous listeners in Yle's ether.
Pälli retired in 1998.

Sari Piippo left his career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - the idea of a comic stripped down: the lack of drawing skills did not slow down
At the time, the organic hammock went out of my husband's statement, proposing it as a story I developed as a person, says Espoo comic book blogger, housewife and former EU translator Sari Piippo.
Sari Piippo says she has been an EU translator for economic and legal affairs in Brussels until after the fourth child, the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I've enjoyed being a housewife really well.
This has been my best time in my life, but at some point it came to mind that what would make it big when the smallest child started to be big.
Then, in 2014, a comic came into the picture.
Piippo says he never dreamed of making a comic, even though he had read Aku Duck, Tintti and Asterix from a small age.
I had drawn the last time as a child, but when these manuscripts of the Loomuhömp was born then the situation changed.
I started with a few dozen manuscripts in the box.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a skilful drawer, but I was not attracted to her before summer 2016, when I donated a line with a dashboard.
His enthusiasm took ten dozens of Strips, and then he had to start trying himself, laughing at Piippo, which tells the drawer that he was a great incentive.
Plateboard is an easy and convenient tool to try and get something done.
I didn't even try to draw on the paper, says Piippo about his relationship with drawing, which he usually does in the evenings.
Manuscripts pop into the mind constantly, but usually I don't make it all at once.
One to three screen strips will take even more hours.
I may make a screen at a time and I love to play with colors.
Starting drawing is always the most difficult because drawing isn't my strongest kind.
Sari Piippo says he appreciates contemporary newspaper cartoons, including Scott Adams' Dilberti.
As a person in the eclipse, there is a carrot-like mother who has been thrown into the L-theme and has a salad of hair.
Other people are Man, Pissis and Gemini.
In the world of ecstasy, man is what he eats.
The series's ideas come from their own life and social media.
Sari Piippo does not want to preach or offer a forced shooter, even though it is sometimes a matter of nature.
Piippo tells his read series with his husband and children.
After all, it is such a great feeling, when you look at comic book, and notes that this is what I have done today.
And the challenges for the housewife are enough!

Indonesian earthquake: Airfighter sacrificed himself - did not leave a cracking tower before getting hundreds of passengers safe
21-year-old Air Force Anthonius Gunawan Agung has become the hero of the Indonesian earthquake.
Agung remained alone in the air traffic control tower until hundreds of people were transported safely from the island shaken by the earthquake.
The young man was in control of the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in Please Town, when the earthquake hit Friday.
While others escaped from the control tower, Agung refused to give up until he was guided from the airplane runway of Batik Air.
That way he could save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian Aviation Authority told AFP.

Eventually, Agung tried to rescue by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.

Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was supposed to be transported by helicopter to a better equipped facility, but he died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived.

At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian Civil Aviation Authority has honored Agung's heroism in social media.

Rehn pondered the end of Europe in a trade war: "Must look at the next tweet"
The US-China trade war is reflected in the global economy.
Growth forecasts have been calculated all over Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly lowered its own economic growth estimates.
Director General Olli Rehn said in Ylen Ykkösaam that although tightening tensions have no direct impact on European trade flows, it weakens confidence, which in turn is reflected in business investment decisions.
The situation also concerns the export of Finnish companies.
Rehn is of the opinion that Europe is so far up to now.
It has been able to build a peace of mind with the United States and has also helped to calm the situation with China and Japan.
In Rehn's view, Europe does not seem to be in the middle of the war.
You must look at the next tweet and rate it afterwards.
We have a pretty unpredictable partner for Washington, but he said in an interview with Yle.
There are also risks in Europe.
One of them is Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and the western world.
The market reacted sharply yesterday to the clearly outdated budget of the Italian government on Thursday evening.
Next year's deficit will be over 2.4 percent of GDP.
Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
Five per cent of the country's loan portfolio is problem loans, and over ten per cent are non-performing loans.
In addition, its public finances are in a weak state and the country seems to be again exceeding its commitment to its European partners.
It may not be worthwhile to paint yet new crises, Rehn replied when he was asked whether Italy would take the European economic crisis.
Another issue facing Europe is Britain's difference from the EU.
Rehn hoped it would fit.
The controversial difference would have far more negative effects.
Rehn started as President of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, Executive Director of the European Central Bank (ECB), retires after a year.
The conversation with his follower has begun.
The name of both Rehn and his predecessor, Erkki Liikanen, has been sparkling in the speeches.
I'm not afraid if Finnish names are included, Rehn said and added that he was not going to comment on the matter further.

HS's Super-Recommended Black Box Shows Continuing Next Week - The Last Tickets to Helsinki are on Sale
The popular Black Box presentations organized by Helsingin Sanomat will continue again in the coming week.
Other performances will be shown at the National Theater on October 2, 8 and 11.
23 October Black Box visits for the first time in Tampere Theater.
There are still some tickets to the National Theater for sale.
Tampere performance is sold out.
Tickets are sold by Lippu.fi.
During the evening, performers and photographers on stage tell a long story that they have prepared for a long time, which has never been published in any HS instrument.
There's something else that nobody has ever heard of with the Guarantee.
"There is a strange spy on the night of Helsinki, an impressive report on the other side of the globe and a telling story about a very topical health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the Black Box Producers.
After the performance, the audience will have the opportunity to meet HS journalists and photographers and continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has organized three years of live journalism.
They have been popular from the start and often sold out.
More than 15,000 people have visited the stand.
The black box was awarded in the Bonnier Gala as a journalist of the year.
The award winners thanked a new way of making journalism and the desire of journalists to come close to their readers.
The Black Box of Spring 2019 will be seen at the National Theater in March-April.

The lost mushroom spider was found thanks to the "open-minded experiment"
The drone of Finnish police is the world leader: "We are being trained"
According to the Rector of the Polytechnic, the police can use the drone in addition to the missing search, for example in crime scene investigation and intelligence.
On Tuesday, the Oulu police managed to find a missing mushroom spider in Raahe in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, Rector of the Polytechnic College, hesitated on the case and mentioned, among other things, that "through our unprejudiced experiment and effective education, we are also the world leader here".
Drone is a pretty new hack and even newer to police.
There is absolutely no statistics that the Finnish police would be a master of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong belief that this is the case.
This has been the case, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported in international events.
There's a lot of interest in it elsewhere, ”says Himberg.
It would be very hard for visitors to watch the drone action of the Finnish police.
We are being trained.
More and more popular
Himberg points out that finding the lost in Finnish winter conditions as soon as possible is very important.
As we have seen, in Raahe's case, the drone was found to be lost in just a few minutes.
Hundreds of drone pilots have already been trained by the Finnish police.
According to Himberg, they are meant to train more.
Drone is already being used for police tasks a lot and their use is becoming more common and increasing in the future.
That's how I would dare say, Himberg says.
In addition to finding missing persons, the police may use drones, for example, in accident or crime scene investigation and certain intelligence tasks.
For example, it is already necessary to review a region a little further, where there is a risk that there will be violence.
In this case, Dronea can use pre-inquiry.

Karelian Rugby celebrated 2 division division victory in Kuopio on Saturday.

At the same time, the Division 2 Championship knew the Rugby of Karelia had a historic rise to Division 1.
Previously, the club has been ranked number one, but at that time the Finnish rugby series was divided into two levels, the SM series and the multi-division 1 division.
The club is going to take the rally, but it will do a lot of work next winter.
The current less than twenty player roster must be raised to 25.
The Division 1 also knows how to increase the number of games and longer trips, so fundraising is also a must.

What is a good leader?
A lot of leadership has been talked about this week in Finland.
Risto Siilasmaa, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Nokia, told an interview with HS about his book Paranoid Optimist, in which he sheds light on his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticizes the leadership of his predecessor Jorma Ollila.
Ollila denounced the allegations sharply, but previous Nokia reports have talked about the inability of leaders to act as a team; fear and speechlessness, which partly caused the collapse of the mobile phone business.

They act calmly, quietly and with determination.
Often they are introverted.
Aswath Damodaran, Professor of Finance, pointed out that the qualities of a good leader must coincide with the life cycle of a company.
In the early stages of the company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the company's future is based.
A mature company needs a manager who knows the numbers.
These lessons were attended by 7,500 visitors at the Nordic Business Forum - mainly Finnish leaders.

A good leader is required a lot.
That is why management often goes wrong, even at the highest level.

They chatted with each other in comrades.
However, they hardly wonder whether they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy to judge outside.

Macedonian name has caused decades of disarray - now people are voting on the matter in a controversial election
In the Balkans, Macedonia is currently voting on the proposal for a new name for the country.
According to the agreement between the Macedonian and Greek Governments, the Republic of Macedonia would be renamed.
So far, Greece has blocked Macedonia's attempts to become a member of NATO and the EU through its veto.
According to Greece, the Macedonian name belongs to its northern province.
The referendum does not mention a new name, but asks whether the voter is in favor of Macedonia's EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement.
Voting began slowly, at least in a school in the center of Skopje in the capital.
Retired nurse Olivera Argirosvka, who voted at school, wished to support the agreement.
A referendum is a change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
It means a change especially for the young, he said.
In 1991, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was officially named as an independent Macedonia.
The government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has been campaigning for the agreement.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has again called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, it is enough to be thrilled if the turnout is over 50%.
The referendum is not binding, but the victory of yes votes would give the mandate to change the constitution.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament is required for a constitutional amendment.
The Greek Parliament has yet to approve the agreement.

Robert Helenius knocked Erka Teper
On Saturday night, Robert Helenius met Erka Teper's heavy-duty professional skating match in Germany.
A 34-year-old Finn took a measure of his 36-year-old German opponent at Waldenbuch, next to Stuttgart.
The main event of the evening was the IBF Federation's heavyweight Intercontinental title match.
The winner of this event will have the opportunity to get into a harder job on Saturday, which is of considerable economic importance.
Helenius solved the match in the eighth, when he knocked Teper with his hard left hand.
Teper was no longer able to get up from the floor.
"Nordic Nightmare" hit his opponent already in the third installment, when the German nose started to bleed.
Helenius and Teper first met in the ring.
They had to pick up in December 2015.
Then Teper relied on injury and retired from the match.
It then turned out that the German had gone twice in the doping test.
Helenius has entered 28 matches for his professional career and suffered two losses.
Teper, a clear favorite in the match, has won 19 professional matches and lost three times in his career.

Students play a rare delicacy: Ancient tragedy - Reduced Oresteia's visual impact
Ancient tragedies are a rare treat on Finnish performances.
For example, the National Theater has last seen an ancient tragedy, Sofokleen Filoktetes, in 1988.
Now, the Theater Academy has brought to the tour starting from the National Theater the only full-preserved play trilogy, Oresteia of Aiskhylos.
Pallets Open in 2015! In the projects, students of the Theater Academy work together with a professional instructor internationally.
This fourth project, like the first one, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
Oresteia received her international premiere in Berlin in April.
Roihan's atonement for Oresteia summarizes the story of the end of the bloodshed of the sentenced Atreus genus and the emergence of the rule of law in an honorable manner for twenty minutes, in particular by intensifying chorus pieces.
The work will be very loyal to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsuur's fine Finnish translation (2003).
Dramatic lights and a presentation revealing theatrical space highlight the simplistic and clear stage thinking.
At the heart of it is the dynamics between the choir-performing performers and the choir.
Both double and triple translations of name roles are used in the performance.
The actors do not leave the scene at all, so, for example, the murders of Agamemnon returning from the Trojan War, and his martial law, Kassandra, are shown on the scene, as opposed to the tradition of ancient performance.
Of course, the performance does not emphasize being faithful to the ancient performance tradition.
Rather, a modern, faithful interpretation of the text is created in front of the viewer's eyes, constantly aware of its ritualistic roots.
Roiha has succeeded in gaining a Master's degree from actress students as a close-knit group, as a single organism, to appear as a rhythmic set.
Particularly in the choir sections, the Actors, who are very expressive and flexibly bend to the sculptural group formations, get their rights on the stage, only by decorating the white curtain.
Impressive.
Oresteia's tour will continue at Kouvola and Oulu Theater.

The fists ran several times in Kajaani
A little over thirty-two men beat up three men in a restaurant in the center of Kajaani, and in front of it, on Saturday morning.
The man first hit a man inside the restaurant, resulting in his removal from the place.
Outside, he pushed another man to the ground, and in the absence of the third man, the beater beat him.
The police seized the abuser.
At the police station, the man was still aggressive and kicked another police officer.
The man also threatened the police with assault and killing.
The man was taken to the pipe to settle down.
The case is being investigated as three assaults and as a violent opposition by an official.
In the center of Kajaani on Välikatu, there was another case of assault on Saturday morning.
The victim was beaten by two men.
First, a 20-year-old Kajaani man hit the victim.
A little later, another man poured him on the ground and the man who had hit him before was still killing the victim.
Outsiders pulled the bastards away from the victim and the police were called.
However, the authors had already left before the police arrived.
The police ask the eyewitnesses to contact the Kajaani police by phone 0295 416 520 or by email to tutinta.kainuu@poliisi.fi.
There are other forms of control, such as written and oral questions to the Commission and the Council, discussions on the programs and results of each Presidency of the Council of the Union and the power to set up investigation committees.

The safety of the Aunt and Sets must be guaranteed
For the first time I received a press release in 1984.
When you get a surprise about a topic in these rings, it's usually a big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, September 27) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was astonished and sometimes a little angry.
I also spoke to Erika Kähärä, a work environment expert at the Trade Union Trade Union (PAM).
He says crime statistics do not tell the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers of course claim otherwise.
The police only get to know the cases that are clearly perceived as serious, and many of the right situations of violence remain unreported.
"Of course, companies have a duty to compile their near-miss statistics on the basis of the Occupational Safety Act, but these statistics will remain for internal use and their data will not be collected," he said.
Spiritual injuries do not end up in statistics.
The problem with violence has always been that they do not always cause physical injury.
Nevertheless, psychological traumas can be much more severe than bruising and wounds.
The difference between the situation of violence and the threat of violence is difficult to draw when a certain level of aggressive threat is to be made violence - even if there is no access.
Too many are afraid of their workplace, even if the actual act does not happen.
Some residential areas are troubled.
The store has acquired guards.
When the opening hours of the stores were released, the media-visible fluttering time was great for its impact on the security of sellers.
"At that time, many employers organized security services for at least night-time hours and to avoid working alone," Kähärä comments.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is drawn.
This now seems to have had an effective effect, but this will produce a new negative trend.
When the guarding situations were well maintained, the impression was that guarding would be unnecessary.
Now, in many places, we are trying to find solutions to remove expensive security services.
Mild assault is a criminal offense, and it is quite understandable that a vendor who has been abused does not want to make an inquiry for a criminal who usually lives near the trade.
But under the same paragraph of the 2011 Act, mild assault becomes a prosecutor if it happens at the workplace.
I think we need precedents now.

Heidi Sohlberg set off for Miss before the live broadcast - "Sara, Iiro is married"
Missing crowning this year is not seen in the traditional way on TV, but the broadcast is displayed on the Viafree site.
The broadcast will be hosted by former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and the host of Viasat and Viapla's NHL and KHL studios Iiro Harjula.
The backstage and red carpet are hosted by Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the presenter trio told the visiting guests and media representatives about the progress of the broadcast.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a fresh applause.
Now, all the women scream!
Now look at this man's hunter, Sohlberg whispered to his colleague in cheering.
The leading races are followed by many of Miss Finland's earlier years.
Among others, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi sat side by side and Sohlberg threw a little joke in either direction.
Sara, Iiro is then married!
Sohlberg snapped at Sara.
The more likely Sohlberg was referring to the just-released Siepp, who laughed at the comment, even though he seemed confused at first.
Sieppi spoke for the first time in the Ilta-Sanomat weekend magazine.
Missikaunotar said that he did not want to open up the reasons for the difference in public, as it is a matter between him and Roope Salminen.
He said he didn't hurry to a new relationship, but he was going to concentrate on himself.
I'm focusing on my own stuff and especially living in my own life alone, Sara Sieppi told me.
Harjula's marriage status emerged at a later stage when Sohlberg mistakenly mistakenly called Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula into a couple.
The presidential trio laughed at the crowd.

Janni Hussi acknowledged the mock.

The demigod tortured his tied partner to cut, burn, and feed a strong sauce
The District Court of Ostrobothnia has condemned a 34-year-old man in Kokkola for a number of crimes against his unmarried partner for three years in prison.
The belt used was a belt, cable and cable ties.
The court condemned these objects to the state.
Rankin's accusation was for a suspicious rape.
However, the District Court dismissed this charge.
The culprit was attributed to four assaults, outrageous assault, coercion, illegal threats, imprisonment, gross deprivation of liberty, and two injuries.
The crimes occurred between 26 March and 24 May.
At the end of the last deeds, the man was caught and imprisoned a couple of days later.
Last Thursday, the District Court of Ostrobothnia gave judgment and ordered a 34-year-old to remain in Vaasa Prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also accused of two grave instruments and the brutal rape on May 22.
However, these charges were dismissed as inexcusable.
The case was dealt with in court behind closed doors.
However, the District Judge issued a public report on the judgment.
According to the District Judge, the accused had directed his spouse to violence, threats and coercion in situations where this had been bound.
The accused slipped into a victim with a knife, burned with tobacco, fed a strong sauce and poured water and coffee over it.
In his judgment, the court ordered the state to forfeit the criminal equipment: belt and cable, cable ties, bathrobe belt, knife and water hammer.
Four Witnesses
According to the District Court, the parties continued to co-exist between the deeds.
It is clear from the judgment that a large part of the most serious acts occurred at the end of the criminal period.
Four witnesses, two women and two men were heard in court.
Victims of 34 years of age must pay a total of EUR 5,800 for pain, pain, suffering and temporary harm.
He hardly has such money, because the sentenced person already has a debt in the collection.

HJK condemns the brutal interference of its supporters in the Honka match: "Violence does not belong to football"
Soccer Betting League HJK released a newsletter on Sunday, condemning the disruptive behavior of its supporters on Saturday's FC Honka match at Tapiola.
"We apologize for the events that followed Honka-HJK for our supporters," the announcement said.
At the end of the match, some 50 HJK supporters rushed into the field and some seemed to be trying to challenge the dispute with Hongan supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
The men of the order did not get into the situation, but police officers and also riding police were needed.
In his announcement, HJK says that the team's players and agents are shocked by what happened.
Post-match events are not in line with the values of our traditional 111-year-old club.
"We are sharply disconnecting from any action that endangers the security of match events," the announcement said.

Philippine inventor flying by drone car - avoiding traffic jams
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some sort of Pelle Peloton.
He is now part of a growing world that swears to invent a flying car - or at least its own version of it.
As competitors, for example, he has such factors as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in mass production of its equipment.
According to reports from the world, a man has used a large part of his property to build his dream.
He started developing his flying car six years ago.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he made his first successful test flight - he was flying his device at an altitude of over seven meters.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope that the device will generate positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said, according to the British Daily Mail.

JHL Anticipates: Tomorrow's Labor Struggle for Childcare and Social and Health Services
In the public and welfare sectors tomorrow, overtime and shift work bans will be seen especially in social and health services and child daycare, says Jivi Jiem's Chairman Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The effects will be widespread, and they will certainly appear in a way that there is not enough staff on the spot.
Everyone has to think about how their children are seeking.
It is now the job of the employer to ensure that the services are played and that the spirit of anyone is not threatened, Niemi-Laine says to the BTI.
According to Niemi-Laine, the lack of employees was also visible at the beginning of the year when JHL members were in overtime and shift work due to contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible for employees not to be recruited through flexibility, but workers have been left overtime or switched.
This is not yet a labor action.
It is a normal norm for every employee to take care of regular working hours and only do them.
JHL opposes the government's intentions to lighten the protection of small companies.
Markku Jalonen, Labor Market Manager for Municipal Employers, does not anticipate the effects of overtime and shift work.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although the services may deteriorate.
Employers from all over Finland are aware of this and have made preparations for what to do.
The area is so vast, social and health, and the technical sector that it is hard to say.
Impacts can vary very much by industry, region and employer, Jalonen said to STT.
Jalonen says that last week we already had experiences with the similar three-day activities, for example, of the Super and Basic Nursing Federation Super, and Tehy, the social and health care union.
Their effects were rather limited.
JHL's overtime and shift ban applies to, among others, municipal, church, state, and private social and health workers.
For example, family day care workers are excluded.
At this stage, the struggle for work concerns nearly 100,000 JHL members.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL's actions may take a long time.
The Alliance is also preparing for other industrial action if the preparation of the law on dismissal continues.
The government should now admit that here I run on the wall and hard.
According to Jalonen, both the trade union and the government must come.
It is special here that the hard is already in the barrel, even though the performance has not been given yet, Jalonen updates.
He admitted that in this situation, the German presidency would have a significant victory if it were possible to draw up a follow-up plan. He also recalled that the 18 Member States that have already ratified the Constitutional Treaty should not be forgotten.
I remember when he praised the puck on the ice on the stage, crossed the blue line, deceived, and your life in full swing.

The Great Coral Reef is created with the help of children and adults - rhythm and sea horse gestures are studied in the exercise districts
The Great Coral Reef of the Other Premises was premiered last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was played for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the previous works of the group, the Great Coral Reef is a work that is being built from beginning to end with the public.
This time, however, a clear-cut presentation will also be built, which will refresh and summarize the observations made in the initial exercises.
Theatrical play is also enough for fairy tales for children.
The child's perspective has already been taken into account in the preparation phase of the work.
However, the Great Coral Reef is not a children's performance, but a performance by adults and children in collaboration.
It provides adults with information and insights on how children take information and make art.
The ability of children to indulge in exercises and common play also slows the distance between adults and children.
The Great Coral Reef is somewhat reminiscent of the Saddle Ball, the Fitness Circle, and the Nature Consciousness, but it is ultimately excited about visits to other, non-human states.
The Great Coral Reef begins with exploring the trails of the coral and the coral reefs and fish.
In six different fitness districts, ghosts of rays and seahorses are learned.
Finally, a less than an hour-long performance with music, lights and glossy paintings and costumes will help you discover the life of the coral reef.
In the great coral reef there are both diving people who observe the life of the coral reef and the corals that are being examined.
There are also coral-looking organisms.
The gazes and observations in many directions make the performance dense and breathtaking.
Ollapa is a landscape of an organism, an organism looking at the landscape and another organism or landscape looking at the organism - and all this at the same time.
For children, it doesn't seem to be difficult at all.
In other spaces, the group strives for the boundaries of thinking and action, where engagement when the group consists of both children and adults is challenging.
On the other hand, the presence of children makes it more significant.

Children grow up too fast - I'm happy that my childhood was not smart phones
Today's children and young people are becoming irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking all the time younger and younger.
In my opinion, children should be children throughout their childhood, and do not mess with their lives because of substance and sex, because others say they do.
I was embarrassed when my friend told me that he had to get his fifth-grade sister on the weekend from a "boyfriend".
When she came to get her humbled sister, she told her about her sex experiences that night.
I could in no way imagine my own sister in the same situation because we have been told and warned throughout our childhood that we should not touch intoxicants and sex is an adult thing.
I hope that today's children would be able to live a decent childhood and would not have to grow up too early because of the group pressure created by their friends.

Yle: The authorities told the government that the case of Airiston Helmi is not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, who interviewed her, the Security Police and the Defense Forces visited the Defense and Foreign Affairs Committees earlier this week.
The Finnish government has been told that the investigation by Airiston Helme is currently not related to national security, but to organized crime, according to news by Yle.
The information of the anonymous sources was confirmed by Mr Ilkka Kanerva (Kok), Chairman of the Defense Committee.
According to Kanerva, the Defense Forces and the Security Police this week visited the Defense and Foreign Affairs Committees to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is primarily considered an economic crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that there would be anything else, Kanerva commented on Yle's interview.
According to Yle's data, no evidence of a link with national security has been found so far, but the investigation is still in the process.
We cannot yet know what can be revealed there, one of Yle's interviewees says.

Video: Dream Paint saved Liverpool's lost series
Liverpool's 100% Premier League start was completed, but it was still a more satisfying team on the 1-1 draw with Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday, it will be a year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and escaped to a 1-0 guest win.
Then the Pep Guardiola combination sent a signal to the whole Premiership that City was serious now.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And certainly Liverpool manager Jûrgen Klopp arrived at the same idea in West London.
The Reds had started the Premier League with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool started stronger and, in particular, Virgil van Dijk seemed to dominate his own field.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had a tremendous league victory from Anfield Road on Wednesday.
Then Eden Hazard rose from the bench to solve the match with a stunning individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was involved right from the very beginning.
In the 25th minute, he first played in a small space with the trio Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
In the end, the Croatian saw Hazard plunge forward and sent him a perfectly weighted throughput.
Hazard took the lead in the penalty area, but he bombed the ball into the bottom left corner of the game.
Pool's brass alisson was a little slow in his fight and didn't get his fingertips.
Klopp certainly felt the killing position a bit unfair, because almost immediately afterwards, Antonio Rüdiger dropped Mo Salah's lead on the goal line.
In the second episode, Chelsea grinder Kepa also got into action.
Baskivahti quickly reacted to Sadio Manén's shot and pushed the ball from the corner of the post to the corner kick.
At the other end, Alisson withdrew his Hazard pass to zero.
The visiting team's Bobby Firminon took advantage of a misunderstanding between the home side's goalie and center backs 72 minutes into the match.
However, the Brass star butt headed toward the national teammate David Luiz, who saved the hosts' lead.
It wasn't a pretty goal, but the free kick by Daniel Sturridge after 89 minutes somehow found its way past the keeper.
Sturridge played with his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed it at the top of an irresistible bet.
Liverpool's 100% league start was completed with a 1-1 draw, but it is still at the top - with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also firmly involved in the championship two points behind the tip.

Some have a noun and some do not.
Distribution lines can arise wherever, and here was one offer.
In the EU, Finland has been making a move away from the annual clock shift.
Very many people agree that the bell-shifting of the bells twice a year has been a problem for fools and caused many problems.
Eventually, this achievement seems to be at least the easiest step for a solution in Finland, even though it has not been easy.
The hardest thing to do now is to decide at what time you finally end up: the current summer or winter time, or some other time zone.
This is also where people can say their opinion on the website.
The survey was opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open until Friday 12 October.
The discussion is fiercely at coffee tables and social media, and everyone has their say.
The defenders of the winter time justify their position with the influence of morning light on people's well-being, and the summer time is influenced by the influence of the evening light on people's desire for outdoor activities and thus on well-being.
Both positions have solid supporters and good reasoning.
Even so, the morning light rhythms the day of man and gives refreshment.
On the other hand, if you did not particularly suffer from the awakening in the dark, it increases the brightness of people moving outside and gives you better opportunities for, for example, autumn gardening.
The amount of extra light after a normal working day has already been counted down to one hour.
I'd rather take both, but badly for our location in the northern corner of the globe, we can't do anything.
Winters are too dark and summers are too bright for many anyway.
A typical discussion on the subject is that one's own vision is being driven and the other's view is strongly opposed.
Counterparty arguments can not just listen, because the most important thing is how the thing oneself feel.
Because almost everyone has an opinion on it, it's somewhat pointless to try to turn the other's head.

Josba fought for a stranger guest victory
Josba's first guest game in floorball in Divar produced Nurm Jymy with three full-time points.
Josba went to Seinäjoki to go home with a cheerful 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Nurmo was still in the lead at the beginning of the third installment, but Josba applied for compositions and recycled men in chains.
In time 50.47, brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi ran a 6-5 victory.
Both teams played decisive minutes in the cool season.
The most powerful in Josba was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2 + 1).
Kakkosketju was also firepowering when Teemu Tuhkanen (1 + 1), Jere Kaartinen (1 + 0) and Jere Kettunen (1 + 0) also hit.
Miika Kosonen (1 + 0) also scored in the second chain at the time of birth.
Josba has six points after three rounds.

200th anniversary of the Eno Church on Sunday
The 200th anniversary of Eno's Church will be celebrated tomorrow on Sunday, in a very sad mood.
A week ago, the burnout of Kiihtelysvaara Church was a shock.
Even Eno's church was guarded two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still a place for celebration.
Although nobody would like it, the Church of Eno is now the oldest church in the Joensuu Congregation.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno in spite of all the covenants of the world.

Already disconnected, built in 1982, the church house is open for the last time today.
Nowadays we are in a dwelling house in a former municipal building, says Markku Koistinen.
The church house was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has been standing still for that 200 years.

Elon Musk Wins From Tesla's Board Chair - Cheating Challenges $ 40 Million
The electric car manufacturer Tesla and the company's CEO Elon Musk have settled their lawsuits with the US Securities Market Authority SEC.
The SEC doubted Musk had been guilty of fraud, and Musk was in danger of being sidelined by his company.
However, Musk will continue as Tesla's CEO.
Instead, Musk will have to step down from Tesla's chairman for three years.
The company has to hire an external board chairman.
Musk also faces tighter controls.
According to the agreement, Tesla has to hire two independent directors and in the future to monitor Muskin's communications.
In addition, Tesla and Musk will pay both $ 20 million (about € 17 million) to settle the case.
"The decision is supposed to prevent new market failures and disadvantages for Tesla's shareholders," says Steven Peikin, director of SEC.
The incident began in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might pull the company off the stock market.
Musk also wrote that the company's financing is secured.
The suite momentarily raised Tesla's share price.
The SEC doubted Musk had been guilty of fraud.
According to the agency, the suite was false and misleading, and Musk had not talked about the arrangement with the rest of the company's management or potential financiers.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
The SEC announced Friday that it would sue the company and Muskin.
The SEC said it would demand that Musk be fined and forbidden to act as a listed company.
The SEC's challenge frightened investors, and Tesla's share fell sharply.

More than 800 people died in the Indonesian quake and tsunami
The number of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and the tsunami that followed it has risen to at least 832, according to AFP news agency.
The number of deaths is still believed to be on the increase, as the destruction of the deaths is still ongoing.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure may rise to thousands.
The Friday earthquake lifted the tsunami that attacked the city of Please, located on Sulawes Island.
Immediately after the quake, the tsunami was given a warning that was quickly canceled.
According to the authorities, almost all known dead are at least Palua so far.
The rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the Donggala area near the center of the quake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Many people are already known to have died.
Ruined help requests
The Indonesian army has been alerted to the rescue workers to find the victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived at the destruction area today, called on soldiers to continue their rescue work without exhausting day and night.
One of the focal points of the rescue work is a hotel in Palu, whose ruins are believed to still contain 50-60 people.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the rescue service agency, told reporters that one man alive was dug out of the ruins of the Roa-Roa Hotel, favored by business travelers.
We also heard people's requests for help, he said.
According to Syaug, heavy grubbing equipment would be needed quickly in the quake and tsunami area.

Politicians' phone numbers leaked into troublemakers in Britain
Many British politicians were subjected to harassment when their contact information was released due to the lack of encryption in the application.
Harassers got access to, among other things, ministerial telephone numbers.
It was an application used by the British Conservative Party Party Congress.
For example, Michael Gove, the Minister for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, driving the Brexit, and former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson were subjected to harassment.
Several MPs received harassment calls.
Due to the lack of application encryption, the audience got access to the politicians' profiles in the app in the conservative party's mobile app.
The audience got access to the profiles using the politician's email address. which was readily available online.
The person logging in to the profile was able to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone was able to change the profile of Boris Johnson for a moment to make a porn movie and title.
Michael Goven's profile picture was replaced by a picture of Rupert Murdoch medulogul.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting application allows logging in to other people's profiles with their email addresses.
Then, the loggers can view the contact person's contact information and, for example, send messages in this name.
The conference application made every journalist, politician, and participant public by telephone, Foster criticized.
The Conservative spokesman apologized for the leak.
He said that the technical problems have been resolved and the application is now working safely.
The British Information Authority ICO supports data leakage.
The application was developed by the Australian company Crown Comms.

There are a large number of Polish killers every week in The Wall Finland
The eye-catching spectators drew attention to the reactions of the studio audience of The Wall Finland.
The Wall, a world-wide popular US format, landed as a Finnish version of Nelonen last Saturday.
The game show hosted by Heikki Paasonen was shot in Poland in the same studio where other international productions of the format are made.
In the Polish studio, the possibilities for shooting were exceptional, as the large 12-meter high play wall required space from the farm.
During the start-up period in the social media, a studio audience of the program was promoted, which was conducted in Polish.
There was a discussion on Twitter about whether perhaps the Poles in the studio could understand anything about the game they were playing in Finnish.
Unne Sormunen, the manager of Nelonen's domestic programs, sheds light on the issue at Iltalehti.
He says that the studio audience is close to the players, other Finns, Finns living in Poland, and just Polish viewers.
The audience is made up of international patrons in Finnish production, just like the crowds of The Wall episodes photographed by other countries in the same production area.
There are also such groups in Finland, so-called professional audiences, who go through descriptions of different programs, Sormunen explains.
He reminds that watching a game by itself is not so difficult, even if you do not understand the language in which it is played.
Red and green wall-falling balls are easy to distinguish.
However, for non-native speakers, there are interpreters in the studio who handle translation work.
There are two interpreters who, as a simultaneous interpretation, translate the events of the studio to the director.
And the studio instructor then instructs the audience and tells us what kind of flap is thrown there, for example, and what the situation is going on, Sormunen says.
He compares the situation with David Hasselhoff's recent domestic production.
A few years ago, David Hasselhoff was involved in Talent Finland's descriptions in Finland.
He always had a simultaneous translation into his ear and he knew everything that was spoken in Finnish, Sormunen sums up.

7 x the most beautiful lamp - here you recognize a good lamp
Wake up to life, create the right atmosphere for your interior and read the book without tiring eyes.
It is good to have good lighting.
We collected three good reasons to invest in lighting.
These were given by Tarja Jokiniemi, Sales and Marketing Director at Innolux.
Serve your eyes
The importance of lighting is increasing, the more years are behind.
With sufficient light, it can help with the problems many people face with age, with reduced vision accuracy and more and more glare.
The need for light also grows older.
The sixties need light three times more than the twenties.
Therefore, it is advisable to put the light on the effects of light and the properties of the luminaire for health reasons.
A good lamp gives enough light, but not dazzling, Jokiniemi hints.
Create beauty around you
Beautiful furnishings can only be found with the right lighting solutions.

On the other hand, home is now invested more than before, and the interior has become a way of expressing itself.

People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So we are very knowledgeable about design, Jokiniemi says.
The home is not necessarily the latest trend-lighting, but a timeless classic for many years.
Certain timeless, jeweled and elegant classics keep their surface year after year, ”says Jokiniemi.

The name comes from the Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaja gruppa: sabotage and intelligence group.

His knowledge was published in the books of Christopher Andrew in the late 1990s and early 2000s
The destinations included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, the KGB acquired the uniforms and accessories of the Bundeswehr, railways, game guards and road workers for DRG groups for cover operations.

Two of them were experienced expedition leaders: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.

Weathers' spirit could be saved by eye surgery carried out before leaving for Nepal.
As a result of it and the air pressure, he lost his sight, which is why the top conquest had to be missed.
Rob Hall went on.
However, Weathers' struggle for life and death had only just begun.
As the storm rose, he was lost and could no longer find himself in the camp.
When a man came to find him, he was found in such a poor condition that he was not believed to survive.
Weathers was left dead.
However, as a miracle trade, he still reached his feet and found others.
The wicked Weathers was thought to still die and once again left behind.
Obviously, contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, the climbers also began to believe in the possibility that he was given help.
In the movie Beck Weathers is played by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.

Today, the 200-year-old Eno Church is celebrated
Eno's 200-year-old church has been celebrated today by the church.
The church was inaugurated on October 4, 1818, and a celebration of the whole family was prepared for the celebration of Sunday.
The celebration began at 10 am in the family church of Eno, after which there was a Karelian dinner table at Eno's parish house.
The church was full.
517 people attended the family fair.
Eno's vicar Armi Rautavuori was glad that people had come to church so much.
It is a great joy for a long time and gives strength to work, says Rautavuori (pictured).
The fire of the Kiihtelysvaara Church has touched many, and was not ignored at the 200th anniversary of the Eno congregation.
The Church of Eno is now destroyed in the fire by the elder Kiihtelysvaara Church of the Evangelical Lutheran parishes of Joensuu.
The wooden church of Kiihtelysvaara was completed in 1770.
In Kiihtelysvaara, there was a devotion in the morning, where the church destroyed in the fire was silenced and remembered.
Photos and Videos: The Medic sparked his power in Greece - The sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A strong hurricane-like autumn storm surged on Saturday in southwestern Greece.
The Mediterranean hurricane, called the medic, has been named Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red weather warning for the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
Pictures taken from the area show a lot of floods across Greece.
The video published on Twitter shows how the river suddenly appeared in the city of Kiato in the Korinthia area instead of the street due to floods.
The second video shows how the car has been driven by flood waters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese Peninsula, strong winds caused severe sea shifts.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens instructs people on their Facebook pages to prepare for a storm in Greece.
The Delegation urges you to monitor weather reports and local authority instructions.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medic, brings with it heavy rain and even a flood hazard.
According to CNN, according to a study published in 2011, medication occurs only once or twice a year in the world, typically around September-October, when sea temperatures are still high.
The blowing storm left behind floods in Tunisia and Libya before continuing to the north and towards Europe.
The refugee camps on the islands, such as Lesbos, have also caused concern in Greece.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees in camps have limited access to decent protection.
In the summer, the areas destroyed by fires in Athens are also under the storm.
In Greece, the medical officer also rushed last November.

You don't have to go to the sea now, still flying on schedule - thousands of Finns are currently vacationing in the Greek islands threatened by the autumn storm
Excursions to the sea are canceled and, while walking, you should be careful not to fly over the branches or other bulk goods.
These guides have been distributed to over 3,500 in Greece by Aurinkomatkat-Suntours for a holidaying Finnish weekend.
The instructions will come in handy, as even the Zorbas storm, which is hit by hurricane attacks, has been predicted to be beaten by the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, near the island of Crete, wind speed can rise up to 45 meters per second.
Heavy rains add to the madness of the weather.
All Aurinkomatkat and Tuin travelers from Greece to Finland who have announced their phone numbers have been warned by the tour operators about the heavy winds by SMS.
Still the sun and heat in the air
According to Aurinkomatkat Communications Expert, Inka Ikonen, the worst of holiday resorts has been avoided on Saturday.
For example, flights have landed and risen according to normal schedule.
Of course, we are following the situation all the time.
Security above will go.
I supported media reporter Antonia Schroderus says that their flights have also been on schedule.
We are constantly in touch with our staff in the subject.
At least Crete was still calm, he told me on Saturday evening.
At present, there are over 1,500 Finnish travelers on the most popular Greek islands, Rhodes and Crete.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are on holiday in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos will arrive on Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, Rhodes had shattered the sunshine and the temperature rose to 27 degrees, says Aurinkomatkat's Ikonen.
It is estimated that Zorbas will move to the next Turkish riot, though slightly relaxed.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our personnel there, and have checked the number of Finns flying to Tuila, for example, in Antalya, says Schroderus.

Two robotic cars start operating in Espoo
They will be operating for the rest of the year and will pick up passengers, the City of Espoo announces.
Otaniemi's robotic cars are in the role of a bus simulator, as it is planned to start the next spring with a robot bus.
The project develops and pilotes year-round robot vehicle traffic and tests the technical performance of vehicles in Finnish conditions.
The experiment shows how robotic cars can survive in the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robotic bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says Johanna Nyberg, Traffic Management Manager.
For the first time, robotic cars are fully automated with no other traffic.
Vehicle safety is always the responsibility of a seated passenger.

Robotic cars run all three days a week in the autumn: on Tuesdays at 13-15.30, on Wednesdays at 10-15 and on Thursdays at 10-15.

The police oversaw hunting in North Karelia and Savo
The Eastern Finland Police Department conducted hunting controls on Friday and Saturday with Metsähallitus and the Finnish Game Center in North Karelia and Upper Savo, the police department battalion staff told on social media on Saturday.
The main focus of control was on the legality and licensing of hunting.
Each hunter was inspected for a hunting card and a hunting permit on state land.
In addition, the permits for possession of hunting weapons and the permitted number of cartridges for self-loading weapons used for channel launching were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the surveillance, and only one hunter was missing who lacked the required hunting license.
A 12 day penalty was imposed on the hunter for unauthorized fishing.
In addition, 133 drivers of the vehicle were blown by the police, and two of them are suspected of drunk driving.
In addition, patrols dealt with five traffic offenses in the penalty procedure, police times.
In summary, hunters adhere very well to hunting.
Many hunters were surprised by the controls.
One hunter said that "I have been hunting area for 50 years and this was the first time anyone check the permissions."
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue to monitor hunting in the autumn with other supervisory authorities.

Mykkänen goes to Turkey to follow the selection of Syrian quota refugees
In the next few days, Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkänen (chef) will travel to Turkey to follow the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
Finland has decided to take 530 Syrian refugees this year from Turkish refugee camps.
The trips are usually made a couple of times a year and include representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy and the police.
The delegation is already interviewing in Turkey.
The United Nations Refugee Organization (UNHCR) first selects people who are particularly vulnerable.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be in refugee camps in a particularly distressing situation, such as single-parent families, the disabled and sick, women and children.
There are more people in the group coming to Finland than there is in the quota, because in practice some of them are not arriving for different reasons.
On the way, Mykkänen will also meet with NGOs from the Turkish Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu and Syria.
Ilkka Salmi, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior, is also on the way.
There was talk of raising the quota
Finland has been taking quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
For a couple of years, the quota was 1,050 a year, but there has been no agreement in the government to raise it.
The Coalition has advocated a quota increase, but the project has last fallen into blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Center) recently announced a gradual increase in quota to 1,500-2,000 people a year.
During this reign, Mykkänen's visit is the first to be made by the Minister of the Interior to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
Previous interior ministers Petteri Orpo (Chef) and Paula Risikko (Chef) were able to move on to their new duties before the visits were organized.
Finland receives EUR 10 000 from the EU for every particularly vulnerable refugee.

Now we go to the hackers - no longer know, weep or laugh
Last Saturday Karjalainen reported on a bill to amend the Animal Protection Act.
The article got the impression that, as a matter of principle, the bill prohibits the keeping of all animals that are not specifically allowed by ministerial decrees as production animals, pets or otherwise.
So everything else is basically forbidden not only for the animals mentioned in the regulation.
If the bill ends with a law, it would mean that we are rejecting the general principle in Western democracies that the law specifically prohibits activities that jeopardize society's safety or good practice.
Now, in principle, we are forbidding a ban on any activity that the law or regulation does not specifically allow.
The change does not allow anything new to be tested in, for example, business, and nothing else is done before a law or regulation that adopts it.
Government activity in drafting legislation in general has been weak.
If we go on the path that, in principle, everything is forbidden in Finland, which is not allowed separately, no longer knows, weep or laugh.
I have no doubt that the Animal Welfare Act would require an update.
But a law project in this direction is not a democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but maybe it will accept such a "everything is forbidden, not allowed by law or regulation separately" procedure.
Hopefully, there will be a sensible minister who will stop the progress of such a law project.
The point indicates the key rating, and the line indicates the 95% confidence interval uncertainty.
The best possible answer would be a ticket - something that will definitely happen at a particular place at a certain time.
Metti Forssell Hints: Four Trendy Feet of Autumn

Kimi Räikkönen summed up the reason for the superiority of Merced compared to Ferrari
Ferrari Kimi Räikkönen admitted that the worst competitor, Mercedes, was too hard a part of Russia's gp time.
However, there is no reason to panic in the Ferrari camp, an experienced driver estimates.
They were just faster than we were, but there is no big deal.
Our car was the best of all time for the whole weekend so far, but they were just too fast, fourth, and Räikkönen, who had clearly stayed behind the Mercedes speed with his teammate Sebastian Vettel.
Ferrari had a hard time in the previous race in Singapore.
Räikkönen was asked where the sudden fall from Merced's ride is due.
They seem to go faster than we do - so simple it is.
If I knew the reason for that, we probably would go as fast as they did.
However, I don't know more than anyone else.
This is always guesswork, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In the course of time, a rare treat was seen for Sauber, the future stable of Räikkönen.
Charles Leclerc, who was replacing Räikkönen next season with Ferrari, was the seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also won the final run.
For the Swedish rider, the tenth starter is best for more than three years.
And even though in the second run, as many as five drivers left it completely, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging for Räikkönen for the future?
Yes, if you compare to where they were from the beginning, then the step forward has been big.
Next year is a different story, so let's see, let's see.

It was there - Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper: "Robbe is back"
The match between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper in Stuttgart evening progressed steadily.
The German was a more proactive party in the ring, but he didn't get a good hit.
Clearly reachable, Helenius controlled the match with his hard lines, which were very good.
The Finn was also in a much better physical condition than Teper.
The solution finally came in the eighth installment when Helenius knocked Teper on the left.
The hit was so hard that the guy in front of the home crowd didn't even try to get up from the carpet.
After the victory, Helenius waved quite moderately.
At the start of the interview, he praised the good atmosphere and his opponents.
Then he changed his tongue for a moment.
Thanks to all the viewers and Finnish promoters.

Helenius was delighted after the match.
It was a huge victory for Helenius's career.

The hesitant response and long reflection of the Miss Finland finalist caused a lot of laughter
Billnäs Ruukki is currently choosing a new Miss Finland.
During the interview, a question was asked to each misifinalist.
The finalists took the question of a glass bowl on the stage.
Especially the finalist number six, Emilia Anttikoski, 23, hesitant response in the crowd of the audience was a sweet but benevolent laughter.
The question presented to Anttikoski came via Facebook.
The user Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what is the latest book, which the misfinalist has read.
Anttikoski thought about his answer well before he began to hesitate.
Thank you for your question, Pirkko-Ella.
Last book I have read is ..., Antti Koski said, pondering.
The crowd of audiences got rid of the laughter until Anttikoski continued to answer:
The last book I read is ...
Yes, I have read the school books!
Probably some economics.
So the last book I read is one of economics, Antti Koski replied.
After his answer, Anttikoski got a crowd of applause from the audience with a laugh.
Earlier on the Miss Tour, Anttikoski attracted attention because he did not want to pose in underwear because of his principle.

This recipe is for you who have good, acidic apples from your own back because the domestic apple is a shocking price in the shop.

This cake can also be made only of apples if the pear does not want to buy.

Status symbols do not attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic or admired?
Analysts at the University of Sydney have outlined two types of "coolness" with a variety of features: a generally charming coolness and partly a dissident coolness.
Charmingly cool people, according to the researchers, had many features that were considered socially desirable: they were outward-looking, friendly, fit and competent.
The dissident, on the other hand, was characterized by distance, independence, rebellion and edge.
They shared their experiences and scarcely looked at the external evaluations.
Both types were combined with good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of cowboy is not cool for a long time: high status in teenage does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is what the American Development study published in Child Development magazine says in 2014.

According to the Embassy, the Greek meteorological service has given the regions a red weather warning.
The upcoming storm also tells you about the weather service on Foreca's blog.
According to it, the storm's hardest gusts are up to 45 meters per second.
By comparison, the Kuisma storm, which was fooling Finland from the beginning of the week, blew at its hardest 31 meters per second.
However, according to the blog, the main concern of the Zorbas storm is not wind but heavy rain.
Over 300 millimeters of water can be reached in southern Greece over the weekend.
It is equivalent to about half of Finland's annual rainfall.

Valtteri Bottas shuddered and burst into adrenaline in Sochi - will he be Hamilton's helper on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas shivered a little bit more for tens of minutes after Russia's pp racing, when he was in front of the media.
The fine round left behind Merced's first star, Lewis Hamilton, and was definitely an important criticism of the Finns who had gathered this season.
Nice tour.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left the round.
Feeling good, shaking a bit even more, Bottas clarified.
I have been a pile only once this year, in Austria (mid-summer), so the time has passed quite a bit.
This track has been good for me in the past, and I got good rounds again.
It is not easy to bypass the Sochi track, so the output is especially big.
And, of course, Bottas was able to answer the question of whether he will drive tomorrow for victory or whether there is a jigsaw of Hamilton approaching the World Championship title.
The starting point for my race is definitely that I try to win.
Not leaving the pile, the other goal can be, Bottas piled.
But as a team we fight for both championships.
Lewis' lead to Sebastian Vettel is pretty big and the difference to me is very big, so keep it in mind.
Let's see what happens, but Bottas did.
After driving, Hamilton was genuinely delighted with Bottas' success, and Merced's boss Toto Wolff was seen to be tasting.
Lewis had the intention of winning Valtter, but he didn't succeed in a twilight.
Valtter knows that he has to tear everything by himself to win Lewis.
And he was so charged that the adrenaline burst out of the ears, Wolff glowed.
To the question, does the stables give Bottas and Hamilton a rigorous run, Wolff responded in the way.
We'll discuss tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.

Syria requires the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops
Syrian Foreign Minister urges US, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.

Not exactly the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court judge drama on TV
Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, professor of harassment, received an exceptionally large number of people on the screen.
In the United States, the full-fledged Supreme Court Judge Nomination drama made at least 20 million people on their TVs on Thursday.
At that time, Donald Trump's Kavanaugh and his blatant Californian professor Blasey Ford were in front of the Senate Legal Committee to tell their story.
According to preliminary results, a total of 20.4 million viewers were followed on six main channels, ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
In addition to their online consultation, there were several million more.
NBC reported that 6.8 million people followed livestriim, and CNN reported a record high of 8.2 million launches.
CNN's figure will rise to over 10 million, including those who followed the broadcast via Youtube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also reached 8.0 million launches.
Digital launches are channel-specific; TV viewers are from Nielsen, a research and data analysis company.
Nielsen publishes final readings on Monday, but they are definitely great.
Few reaches 20 million
In the United States, more than 20 million viewers usually only have access to sports matches, major Oscar and Grammy entertainers, and occasional political events such as presidential speeches and in 2016 presidential elections.
Of course, the United States Football Championship, the American Football League's NFL finals, is on the way to the Super Bowl.
This year, the Super Bowl gathered some 103 million people across the squares on the NBC channel.
Last year, Trump's first speech to Congress, Nielsen said, was a total of nearly 48 million people and inaugurated over 30 million people.
The most important thing
Judging by the Supreme Court is an extremely important case in the US, as the posts are lifelong.
Trump was already able to appoint one new judge when Antonin Scalia died in early 2016 and the Republicans succeeded in preventing then President Barack Obama from appointing a successor.
Another place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced this year is retiring.
Kennedy was nominated by the Republican President Ronald Reagan, but on several issues he was a so-called scales language, the voice of which could solve the position of a nine-member court.
He was a supporter of abortion and sexual minority rights and, for example, resolved in 2015 to vote for same-sex marriages throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative in his stems.
His choice to the Supreme Court may be a decree for decades of conservative power.

Children have the right to know their parents
Only parents of children under the age of 10 see the health information of their children.
It's a big problem, it's wrong and it's strange.

Relief Organizations Prepare to Start Work at Indonesian Sulawes - "Clean Water is the Most Urgent"
The UN Children's Organization Unicef and other international aid organizations are ready to help on the island of Sulawes, Indonesia, says Kirsi Haru, Information Manager at Unicef Finland.
Local authorities are leading the rescue work, but the need for additional assistance is already evident at this stage.
Unicef operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programs in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operation, Unicef always has full emergency preparedness, says Haru.
The first task now is to find people in ruins, both survivors and dead.
Please, in the town of Sulawes, rescue operations are in progress, but the situation in the Donggala area is a little more northerly.
There are still places where connections do not work.
Assistance is difficult because the roads are also broken, says Haru.
Buildings are often lightweight in Sulawes, so the damage caused by the earthquake and the tsunami is great.
When survivors have been found, they need protection - first of all tents - and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
The first thing people can do is to offer water purification tablets, which are also in stock at Unicefil.
Efforts are being made to repair water systems as soon as possible, but in the event of an emergency, water is first transported, for example, by truck.

Billionaire Elon Musk quits Tesla's board chairman - $ 20 million fines for twins
Elon Musk, founder of space rockets and electric car companies, avoids fraudulent charges by agreement with the US Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk will cease to serve as chairman of the board of the electric car company Tesla and will agree to a fine of $ 20 million.
Musk retreats as part of a contract he entered into with the US Securities Market Authority.
By agreeing to Musk avoid fraudulent charges.
The US Securities Commission SEC threatened Muskia's fraud due to the tweets he sent in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing to withdraw Tesla, an electric car company, which caused the company's share price to rise rapidly.
According to the agreement, Musk is not allowed to chair Tesla's Board for three years.
In addition, Tesla has to appoint a new "independent member" to the board and take two "independent directors" into its management team.
Tesla must also set up a committee to oversee Muskin's communications.
Musk is still able to continue as Tesla's CEO.
In addition to Musk's personal $ 20 million fine, Tesla also has to pay a fine of $ 20 million to the financial supervisor.
Twits led investors to mislead
According to SEC, Muskin Twits led investors and Tesla shareholders to mislead.
Musk claimed that he would have secured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange into a private limited company.
According to the Billionaire's tweets, the company would have been bought off the stock market at a $ 420 share price.
Tesla's share price rose by more than ten percent a day after twelve, but fell later.
According to the SEC, Musk's claims had no basis whatsoever.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated the alleged funding.
Nor did he discuss the withdrawal from the stock exchange with other management or company boards.
On Friday this week, the rate dropped by 14 percent when the SEC issued a fraudulent charge.
The agreement is expected to reinforce the company's course again.

At the same time, Jamsen confirms the fact that the Church in Helsinki has already mentioned the Twitter account.
The account states that the last judgment is not the reason for the clock to stop.
Jamsen says that the church watches do not ring because of a fault.
