Eemeli Kouki led to Hurricane's home victory in the opening - Savo Volley's second victory
Seven times in a row, the men's flying ball at Mestaruusliigan's medals had Hurricane-Loima started the season 2018-19 with a cotivo, when Raision Loimu crashed 3-0 on Saturday.
Overall player Eemeli Kouki, who returned from Romania to Finland, was 22 points the most effective in Hurricane.
There were some recitals abroad, but they didn't come true, and then came a play from Loimaa.
Time quickly got hommat agreed, Kouki said.
Like Kouki, Loimussak's played Tomi Rumpunen backed Kouk with 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was Samuli Kaislasalo, who played with a match-to-match contract at 17 points.
Opening game victory is always important.
Many players had experience against each other, and it brought a further streak into the game.
Our game isn't ready yet, but the continuation of the meter pipeline is of course a goal, Kouki said.
Määttänen Savo Volley's most effective
Miro Määttänen was 18 points Savo Volley's most effective when the team fell in Vieremä with Vantaa Ducks 3-0.
Our game was splendid, especially at the end of the attack, but thankfully we got a purged victory.
I didn't have any knowledge of a different charge when I played against my former team, Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his 2000-01 career in Vieremä's Lentopallo 3-series, scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was happy with many things.
Halli was small, i.e. a tunnel in the roof all the time.
A good fiilis missed a home invasion.
Miro was kunkku, Sillikin played a good game, Tuovinen said.
Siltala's previous season in the league was 2006-07, when she won silver in St. Petersburg's Sammos while Tuovise was then the head coach.
Thiago Maciel was Ducks' most effective 14 points.
Mikkonen again star of Akaa-Volley
In the 2012-13 season, Joni Mikkonen, who won the league's points exchange, has started this season strongly.
The hacker scored 25 points when Akaa-Volley took his opening win of the season after crashing Kokkola's Tiikerit 3-2.
The season has begun from its own point of view.
Today was certainly a defeat nearby, because we were fourth in a loss of 17-21.
There was something scorched, and the fifth batch came in at the same time, Mikkonen said.
A few seasons ago, the most effective animals still in the finals were 28 points scored by hackers Edvarts Buivids.
Earthman Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs backed 17 points.
Nothing could be taken into the guy's hack, Mikkonen praised.
- If you're worried, boy, this isn't execution, it's teaching.
Finland in comparison of human capital with the world's individual
"Finland is at the forefront of the world in comparing human capital," says Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
During the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was the individual of the statistics.
In 2016, the tip was almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Iceland, Denmark, Canada and Holland were among Finland's.
Later, Holland ranked one higher and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found on the list.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan were ranked among the worst in comparison.
Measuring human capital will look at levels of education in the population, access to education, skills and health.
The World Bank has lined human capital to be linked to economic growth.

Us is now attacked against abortion law - a powerful document explains why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to figure out whether Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate nominated by President Donald Trump, could be elected one of the Supreme Court's nine members.
In the Republican Party, many hope that Kavanaugh's crucial voice would repeal a well-known decision against Roe, known as Wade, that made abortion in the U.S. legal in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary Reversing Roe - USA and abortion rights tells how the current situation has come over the years.
As incredible as it seems, the subject is timely in Finland too.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (sin) has done a publicity campaign against safe abortion and has received support from the vast majority of our country's representatives from different levels.
At the beginning of the powerful documentary, you will meet the gynaecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has remained the only doctor who performs abortions in the state of Missouri due to the tightening of the laws.

There were about 5000 deaths in the U.S. a year.
Abortion legalisation was defended, particularly by the Republican Party.
Already in 1967 in California, the abortion law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
It was later that Reagan, during his campaign for presidential elections in 1980, began to confuse religion with politics to haalise voters.
His Aborttikantan was also rounded up by his successor George Bush's parents.
And Donald Trump did the same.
At the deepest heart of the matter, the documentary boasts of looking for a basis for politicizing abortion.
When tax exemption was refused from religious organisations in favour of racial separation, they became politically active.
Abortion was chosen as Keppihevo.
Religion has brought exceptional knots to politics.
Writing this in the USA, there is a situation in which the president, who tapped on his abortion channel with his sexual harassment, has chosen the Supreme Court candidate Kavanaugh 'n which is now accused by several women of sexual harassment.
Kavanaugh may gain vaa'anglish-based power to decide the rights of 164 million American women and girls.

Israeli army shot seven Palestinians, among two children - big demonstrations on the border
About 200 Palestinians have been killed in half a year, when Israel has brought protesters to the border zone.
On Friday, Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in Gaza's border zone, the Palestinian Ministry of Health reports.

The army says it's started using force that protesters don't break down the boundaries or try it to the other side.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in Gaza's demonstrations since March, when Palestinians began weekly demonstrations at the border.
There are 12,000 vulnerable, according to the UN Human Rights Commissioner.
Protesters demanded Palestinian families access to areas where Palestinians had to leave when the Israeli state was founded in 1948.

Paedophile assistance service immediately completed bookings - In Finland, about 40,000 experiences interest in children
It is estimated that two per cent of men and a small proportion of women experience at least some sexual interest in my brotherhood.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
Until now, it has been difficult for those interested in children or young people sexually to get help.
The joint SeriE project of the Criminal Care Support Foundation and Sexpon trains professionals to meet paedophiles as customers and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.

But these are promised to be released in autumn.
Sexual preference for children causes many to be ashamed.

In my opinion, work is valuable if one child is saved from sexual violence, Thesleff says.

Coreoiden leaders or a congolais gynecologist?
U.S. President Donald Trump as Nobel Peace Prize winner - the idea may sound strange, but Trump is one of the biggest favourites to win the prize based on betting odds.
Behind this is Trump's role in getting North Korea at least on the level of speeches to commit to nuclear disarmament.
The biggest favorites to peace Nobel have been told by South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have already met three times this year and promised to seek a peace deal. entre ses États.
The temperature between the corées is considerable, as still last year the midterms were good.
Nonetheless, rewarding Kim, who has been threatened for many years by nuclear weapons, and leading the country on iron, would undoubtedly raise criticism as well.
Nobel Prize winners will be announced as of Monday, and Friday will be the highest attention received, or the Peace Prize.
If the prize is not awarded to those involved in the Korean peninsula diplomacy, there is one candidate congolais doctor Denis Mukwege.
In his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo, an appreciated gynaecologist has treated thousands of women victims of mass rapes and emerged as a leading expert in his field in the world.
Mukwege has attracted attention during his work to sexual violence, which is a crimson by-product of many conflicts.
A strong candidate has also been considered the UN refugee association, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Committee has announced that this year there are 331 candidates.
The names of the candidates are not reported to the public.
Trump himself wouldn't panic if Nobelin got it.
In May, the journalist asked her at the White House whether she thought she deserved a peace award.
Everybody thinks it, but I wouldn't ever say it myself, Trump said with a smile.
I want to get this ready.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, the president continued to refer to the North Korea talks.
But there are things that make Trump's Nobel unlikely.
The award-winning Norwegian Nobel Committee has often given recognition to individuals and organisations representing liberal democracy and a diverse world order - precisely the kind of international cooperation that Trump opposes. has been seen.
In the 21st century, the prize has been awarded to three American politicians, all of whom have been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
So, rewarding Trump would demand an ideological full-scale from the Nobel Committee.

Fire announcement in tunnel: motorists behaved like garlics and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos at Ykkösti Lohja took place on 8 September.
Due to the announcement, traffic in the tunnel area was cancelled in both the direction of Turku and Helsinki.
Lorsqu' il s' agissait d' une question systémique, l' établissement de combustion s' efforçait de transformer le trafic en normale.
But it didn't succeed very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Centre said it couldn't be opened, because there are motorists on the road and they're driving how to happen, daytime firefighter Pasi Kääriäinen told the freshness at the time for STT.
At the time, the motorway was started to drive even in the wrong direction just after a moment of waiting.
When the first starts running against traffic rules, a few others are often followed in succession, Tapio Heiskanen, the liaison chief executive responsible for traffic safety, is surprised.
According to traffic rules, motorways and tunnels shouldn't stop like forced reasons.
Traffic safety recalls that in exceptional circumstances it is impossible to leave to jeopardise traffic with emergency solutions.
Alarm vehicles must always provide the most accessible route possible.
Driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is, in particular, prohibited, as well as making an u translation and cancelling.
The same bans also apply in tunnels where, in addition, you always need to switch headlights on.
Stopping without compulsive cause is also prohibited, as is true when parking.
There have even been incidents in which the driver has stopped at the tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for that operation, Heiskanen says in the Transport safety briefing.

Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their celebrations, although the ship remained attached to the lake base
Ilves fans carried by inland waterway m / s Tampere would have liked to stay on board to continue their winning ceremony, though the ship had been stuck from its bow to the lake base, says the ship's chief executive at the time of the event. Juho Syrjä.
From Hämeenlinna to Tampere, m / s Tampere drifted away late on Saturday night, leaving his bow at the bottom of Vanajaved in Akaas.
19 passengers and five crew members were evacuated on the continent during the night.
Nobody was injured in a raven.
Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their celebrations on board until the morning, but it was true that it was more sensible to send them to port and bus home by fire facility, Syrjä said to STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna following Ilveksen and HPK's match, which ended in Ilveksen's 4-3 victory.
Remote, Saturday's haver was due to the fact that Vanajaved's water surface was about half a metre lower than normal.
Navigation was also complicated, according to Syrjä, by the fact that the closest badge was in the cover of logs, which is why its reflectors did not normally appear in dark causes.
No more mentioned collision
Haveri happened a little west of the narrow Jumusensalme after the naval route had crossed the motorway bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
The greater drama was not associated with the incident, according to Syrjä, as the boat's pace was very low at the time of the event, and the fact that hitting the bottom did not cause a more mentioned collision.
The remote says that lagging on the ground has not caused ship leaks, nor pressures, and those visible ship cruises continue normally.
On Saturday morning, the divers went to check the ship's condition before the ship started priced out of the lot.
For reasons of certainty, we are still visiting the yard to verify that no harm has been caused by this, Syrjä says.

Trump jury candidate accused of harassment and rying may remain without a peak
Brett Kavanaugh, presented as the judge of the U.S. Supreme Court, may well remain without his goal of a post, estimates programme director Mika Aaltola from the Foreign Policy Institute.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate use during their studies.
According to Aaltola, the doubts have brought so much political pressure to the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up putting someone else in office.
It has happened earlier then in the United States that the president's candidate as Supreme Court judge has provoked plenty of contradictions.
Then the jury candidate is usually withdrawn himself, says Aaltola.
That's how the president has been able to preserve his face.
The appointment would be a hundred democrats' laari
The U.S. Supreme Court is seeking to be above politics, but at least in Kavanaugh's case, the choice of a new judge has become a politically very sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision will likely hunt Aaltola to the Democratic Party laari in the forthcoming interim elections in Congress.
It would increase voting intensity among young people and women, who would be more likely to vote Democrats.
On the other hand, appointing a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
The occasion for appointment doesn't hit every presidential term, as Supreme Court judges in the United States are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have abandoned their own request for retirement at the age of about 70-80.
From the Republicans, some hesitate to appoint
The U.S. Supreme Court jury candidate is normally subject to a background check, Aaltola says.
Although Trump has only imposed a week's deadline on the FBI's further investigation, it can still bring something essential to the fore, according to Aaltola.
Yes, it may bring.
Rarely is smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, the certainty is at least that Kavanaugh 's aptitude or inconvenience to the post will be discussed still lively before the Senate makes its decision.
The Republicans have a majority of 51-49 votes in the Senate, but at least two female Republican senators are thought to be suspicious of Kavanaugh's appointment.
The most intimidating thing would be that the appointment would be spent on the vote and the Republicans would disappear.

Woman identified Salisbury as an agent of military intelligence
The Russian woman has told the broadcaster BBC that she recognises Salisbury's poisonings as an agent of the suspected Russian military intelligence service.
Based on photographs, the woman told Anatoli Tshepiga, who works at GRU, it's a military inquiry.
Nettiyhteisö Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia previously told them they had revealed another of the suspected men were poisoned as Tshepig.
Earlier, they said they had found evidence that the men's present personalities were cover-ups.
The bbc group travelled to Kauko-Itää near the Russian-China border village, where Tshepiga seized.
The woman living in the village identified the young Tshepigan Bellingcat from the photos published.
He identified the same man from photos of the British police, featuring a man calling himself Ruslan Boshirov today.
Russians are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with Novitshok-hermomyrky in March.
The Skripals survived.
Eversti Tshepiga has been rewarded, among other things, with the Russian hero's honour in 2014.
Russia is still disputing the suspect's GRU link.

Old people as throw bags in war reform
A vivid example has now been obtained of what the Sipilä government's definition of a war reform restriction in practice means.
My synnyhood Vaalan sote services are producing Oulunkaaren municipal groupe, whose health service manager was elected Attendon's former regional director in 2016.
Leaders of the joint municipality warn the delegation of a change restrictor.
Should war spending now rise, the municipality's state aid will be cut in the future.
The municipality's centre-leaders strangled, and most of them are therefore ready for a major structural change in elderly care, which would put an end to the institutional care of the health centre's bedroom and the department of small mental illnesses.
Home care would be enhanced, meaning long distances in Vaala, that the elderly living in the remote village would be torn from the roots to be treated next to the health centre "at home."
Attendo relied that the municipality would pay it to customers.
Vaala's left didn't swallow a bad preparation, but organised a good audience ceremony, bringing together a lot of families, close nurses and other party delegates as well.
I presented in the diocese of Warsaw how the municipality of Vaala is treating the elderly at home for the most part throughout the northern Ostrobothnia.
Carina Läntinen, the neighborhood's mandate, was also involved.
The local magazine made a big jute for the occasion, while raising Oulunkaaren's manufacturers to their backs.
Sote manufacturers don't write on any paper that Attendo has built a new hoivakode in Vaala, which is now waiting for its empty residents.
There are no other service providers.
The manufacturers are just talking about the service list, but they don't tell what level of care it receives or what kind of staff structure Attendo is going to care for the elderly until safekeeping.
Without a nurse?
Because there's no doctor's overnight stay there, the health centre's establishments will be stopped.
Attendo is also going to resort to doctors at the health centre in Vaala.
Vaala's example illustrates how centre-based officials rotate authorized persons with insufficient information and authorized persons are punched against the wall at the change limit.
That's how the centre party empties the inhabitants of Vaala, because whoever stays there unsafe to live voluntarily if there's an opportunity to move away.

Turkish President Erdogan opened the Grand Mosque in Cologne
In the city of Cologne in Germany, thousands of people demonstrated their opinion when Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a Turkish president visiting the country, opened the mosque of Europe's largest.
Several hundred people had been gathered on the Rhine beach as early as the morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read in the villages of protesters, and the slogans condemned fascism.
Several demonstrations have been held during Erdogan's visit, which began on Thursday, and security measures have been rigorous.
In Cologne, about 10,000 people were expected to protest, including the human rights situation in Turkey, in advance on the streets.
Erdogan supporters had also been gathered for the Great Mosque neighbourhood.
But the police had isolated a large area from the mosque's surroundings for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised his visit to Germany for being successful and estimated the relationship between Germany and Turkey that had confirmed it.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel swore on Friday that they would rebuild relations between the countries, which have deteriorated significantly since Turkey's 2016 coup d'etat.
But Merkel stressed that there were deep disagreements between countries, including on human rights issues.
Criticism around the visit
Both Cologne's mayor Henriette Reker and North Rhine-Westphalia's prime minister Armin Laschet withdrew their involvement in the openers when criticism of Erdogan's visit accelerated.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, told him to come to a protest against Erdogan from Switzerland.
I want to be the voice of those who can't go to the streets in Turkey.
They have been arrested, killed and subjected.
For Erdogan, anything that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
A significant proportion of the population is of Turkish origin in Erdogan's last stage of the German trip to North Rhine-Westphalia.

Agüero raised his own goalkeeper to five when he saw Sterling and Brighton's defense come back at 65th minute of the game.

In an interview with Swiss magazine Blick, Mersu's British musician was asked whether he believed Kimi Räikkösen's release from Ferrara's services would help Hamilton in the rest of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second couscous Sebastian Vetteli with 40 points in the World Cup.

Football's A-Youth SM-series Championship became a full farssi: the opponent arrived at the scene with only 7 players' forces
The top series of football boys ends on Saturday, playing the last round of the season.
Before the 13th round of the Championship, the starting points were clear: FC Lahti for the Academy was enough for an individual space in practice against Vasa IFK.
To turn the situation around in the final round, Ilveksen, who is second in the Championship, must beat PK-35 and hope for the defeat of the talented.
In practice, however, the Lahtelaist championship secured already before the start of the wicket, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players' forces.
Should there have been one less Waasalais, the match could not have been started.
FC Lahti Akatemia won the match 16-0.

Serena Williams harasses with a video where she sings in the topless - campaigns for breast cancer awareness
Serena Williams, the superstar of tennis, is envious again.
Now she's campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by publishing a video on her Instagram account, in which she sings her hands alone in front of her breasts, reports the news agency AFP.
The piece is Australian The Divinylsin's 1991 hit I Touch Myself.
In the video, Williams supports the work of the Australian breast cancer association.
"I voted for The Divinys' worldwide hit to remind women to do regularly omnipresent [breast] checks," Williams writes in her Instagram post.
And yes, this placed me in the discomfort zone, but I wanted to do it because the subject touches all women, regardless of skin colour, throughout the world.
Early detection is all a and o - it's a game for many lives.
Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53, is the second writer of The Divinyls.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which has been made in honour of Chrissy Amphletti.
"She lost her breast cancer but gave us a hit table to remind women to put her health first," Williams says.
The video has now been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was published early on Sunday morning.
In the video's comments, Williams is praised for courage.

Is it worth going to work tomorrow in a small flu?
Here's the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
Many are scared whether or not you're staying home.
However, it is worth considering whether it is worthwhile for others to go infectious, because the disease can be infectious, even though their own symptoms would be small.
In between, flu symptoms suddenly struggle, in between, they appear on the skies.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, although your own symptoms would feel small, reports the Prevention publication.
So is it worth staying home?
According to Prevention, flu is infectious even when a person has no symptoms.
The virus is infected days before the symptoms start and from five days to a week.
Children may infect the disease for longer.
As soon as you identify the symptoms, you shouldn't be in school or at work.
You can come back to work when you cough and you don't have fever anymore, says medical professor Gregory Poland.
Workout is also worth avoiding.
Too quick to return to the hall slows recovery.
Besides, wash your hands, throw them in the nose and throw them in the raspberry.
But as a pain in the movement?
If you have to leave a home sick, consider using a protective mask.
The mask doesn't like viruses, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
Then the fingers don't come into the nose or mouth, Poland says.
The brainstorms are also restricted with the mask.
How could infections then be avoided?
The best way is still to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
But it's hard to avoid the latter.
In the United States, for example, the average man touches his eyes, nose or kisses every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.

Lehterä looked overwhelmed, the playground wasn't sure yet
Jori Lehterä's strong power play came to light when his NHL club Philadelphia Flyers played his last workout before the start of the season.
Philadelphia won Boston 4-1, and Lehterä eaten Michael Rafflin twice into the ground.
In recent days, Lehterä has been on display due to drug injuries.
MTV told on Wednesday that Lehterä is one of 23 suspected drug compounds, where some are suspected of drug use and some parts of sales, for example.
Lehterä has controversially pleaded guilty to the crime.
The club and the player have discussed the subject, and the NHL is investigating the case.
Sam Carchidi, the journalist of the Philadelphia Inquirer magazine closely following the Flyers, estimated after the match that Lehterä belongs to a group of six attackers, five of whom receive a seat in the NHL team.
Lehterä was excellent, according to Carchid.
In the second, Lehterä battled the kiekon himself with a force, pulled the defender's bouquet and fed Rafflin, who was waiting in front of the goal.
For the second time, the cooperation between the two brought the goal quite at the end of the match.
The Flyers will start the NHL season on October 4 with a guest match against Las Vegas.

Ex managers demand unpaid rewards from Robert Helenius
Boxer Robert Helenius's evening match against Erkan Teperi is shadowing the rahari.
Ilta-Sanomat today announced a challenge application filed by boxing manager Jaakko Helmisen and vice judge Jussi Kokkila, in which Helenius receives a total of fairly over €80,000 in favour of unpaid managers awards.
According to the challenge application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius 15.4.2014-30.1.2015.
We've tried to agree, but there's no other option.
There has been a clear mandate here, and a lot of work has been done, Kokkila says to Ilta-Sanomi.
Helenius's current manager, Markus Sundman, sent a reply to Iltalehti telling you about the events in the boxer's vision.
Helenius disputes being obliged to pay the sum demanded.
In return, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services in an economically troubled situation to Helenius and promised to be able to organise matches and sponsorship revenues for him.
Sans doute, it had been agreed that Helenius was obliged to pay premiums for only percentages of his matches.
It was repeatedly assured that Helenius needed nothing to pay, only to receive the revenues arranged by them.
This is also a normal and unique practice in managing professional athletes.
No salary work has ever been agreed and such would also have been absurd in Helenius's situation, Sundman finds out in his communication.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
In return, Helenius would have liked to agree to a revenue distribution in writing from the outset, but Kokkila and Sundman did not receive the draft until the end of 2014.
She said the proposal on her own behalf, breaking down cooperation with Kokkila and Helmisen.
Helenius didn't sit talking to Kokkilan and Helmisen.
A year after the cooperation ended, Helenius had been shown a "unidentified but measurable" drop in the manager's work.
This year, the position has been raised with the same allegations.
Helenius considers Helmisen and Kokkila's aftermath to be cowardly, the reply says.
Helenius faces today's boxing alliance in Stuttgart, Erkan Teper, the seventh challenger of IBF's heavy series.

Heartfelt man and good journalist
Ilkka "Ile" Vainio, a violin artist and music producer, felt an advanced radio trainer and journalist Erkki Pällin for decades.
Erkki Pälli, a long-line radio trainer and journalist, lost to impaired liver cancer at the age of 83.
The drinker's death announcement was published Sunday in Helsingin Sanomi.
The announcement indicates Päll's death on 3 September.
Pälli told him about the serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen at the time by Ile Vainio, whose knowledge of the fate was tolerated.
He's already left on Facebook as though he's icy, Ile Vainio says.
Vainio considers Erkki Pälli as a multidimensional partenaire, which became a brilliant journalist.
She remembers Päll's being considered a man who had quick hooks and funny jutut.
I learned to know Erkin already as a little boy when I went to Finnlevy at the age of 12 for the first time and started there as a stolen man.
We were familiar with Erkin then.
He was then a Finnlevy informant and in various roles, Ile Vainio remembers.
When I was going to make records as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Pälli was the incumbent of artists at every ceremony.
He was always expert and saw how much fire he had for entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, she got straight to her interviewing skin.
He was a heartfelt man and a good journalist.
For many, she became acquainted with Ylen as a radio-runner, but she also wrote brilliant magazines.
Erkki interviewed me many times.
He was good to talk, Vainio praises.
Over the decades, Pälli worked with Toivo Kärjen in addition to provider work.
He worked as a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir's records.
Päll's greatest passion, however, was a radio work in which she had an omintake style.
She worked on radio from the 1960s, and she became acquainted with numerous audiences at the Yle Eetter.
Pälli retired in 1998.

I heard my wife crying for help, but then came silence
Dozens of bodies are lying in a hospital backyard in Palu's city on the island of Sulawes.
Only one building distinguishes them from the area where injured survivors have been assembled for assessing the need for injuries and treatment.
Patients should also be treated outdoors due to traceability.
One of those moving in the hospital area was a 52-year-old Baharuddin, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses just one name.
I have one child, and she's in the streets.
I spoke to him last time he was going to school, Baharuddin told AFP.
Dwi Haris, who has received injuries to his back and arms, lay in the yard of the Army Hospital in Palussa.
She was at a local hotel with her wife and daughter at the beginning of the rebellion.
The family had been invited to Paluu's wedding party.
I was probably forced to squeeze under the collapsed wall.
I heard my wife crying for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they're safe, Haris news agency told AP, according to British media.
Small shops being robbed
At Palu's evacuation centre, 35-year-old baby mother Risa Kusuma tried to calm her baby from fever.
She described the tunnels in the city as symptoms.
Pure water is scarce.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere, Kusuma said.
Many of Palu's residents have slept outdoors or in temporary bamboo houses.
Although the house would be able to somewhere else, potential traces could destroy it definitively and bury residents underneath.
More than half of the prisoners in Palu's prison were expelled after the prison walls collapsed, according to the news agency AP.
Prisoners were knowingly about 560, so there are potentially around 300 carriages.
Part of Donggala's prison prisoners has also fallen, reports The Jakarta Post.
According to the magazine, prisoners raided and blazed into the prison's fire after the guards had denied them leaving to search for their relatives affected by the earthquake and tsunami.
Palu's airport has been reopened mainly for assistance flights.
Among the first, the army's C-130 carriage machine landed on the field, bringing aid supplies.
Commercial flights to Palu's field are only allowed in a limited manner.
Pilots are forced to descend on the field without the assistance of the air traffic control as the air traffic control tower was badly damaged during the earthquake.
Rain wipes overnight across Finland
Throughout the country, an anti-Sunday night spreads a long rain zone from the west direction, reports the Institute of Ilmatia.
Rain mostly comes as water, but in central and northern Lapland it is expected to burst or snow.
The top packs of the previous night are not repeated because under the cloud cover, temperatures remain higher.
The Pilviser Night keeps the lowest temperatures time efficiently in check.
Even in the west, you can visit instantly on the side of the pack, said daytime meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rain zone is coming towards the east with a measurement of the morning.
There are cuffs or pupils in the south and west.
In the afternoon, temperatures always move to Oulu's altitude by stages of 10-13 degrees.
The beginning week appears similar to the temperatures in the south and middle of the country, but the weather is becoming more volatile.

Miss Suomi - finale not visible on TV
From IL-TV, you can watch the red carpet glamoury and electricity of the Miss Suomi contest.
Iltalehden entertainment journalists attract direct broadcasts on IL-TV from the red carpet of the Miss Suomi final from the Billnäs screens.
The broadcast begins at around 18.50am.
The new Miss Suomi will be crowned on Saturday by 10 finalists.
The Miss Suomi 2018 finale is held in Billnäs' screens in Raasepor.
Before the finale starts, you'll be able to follow the atmosphere from the spot on the live broadcast of IL-TV.
The live broadcast starts at around 6.30 p.m. and continues for about an hour.
A particularly large number of Miss Suomi winners of previous years have been invited to the finale this year.
In the jury, they are represented by Miss Suomi Jonna Ziprus of 1998.
Other representatives of the jury include welfare entrepreneur Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammouda, CEO of Jounin Kaupan Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen and Seiskan news producer Katja Lintunen.
If the ring persists, Andy may be in the leadership of the entire Baja 1000.
In addition, every year, a young director is rewarded, whose first or second entire evening film has received the widest dissemination in Europe.
We please a parikymph, harmless and careless set, - we hold small and quiet celebrations today.
We hoped he would get to university before going to missionary sources
The Russian Dimitri and Svetlana mother believed in her daughter's success in the Miss Suomi final.
Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova, parents of fresh Miss Suomen Alina Voronkova, followed their daughter's first-time crown with pride.
Ignoring the audience from Pertunmaa, they were going to drive back home after the finale.
It's a wonderful atmosphere!
We believed in Erika all the time, but half an hour before the result began to be tense, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is an Indian and Dimitri is a Russian.
Alina spoke to a smooth Russian, although she has lived her entire childhood in Finland.
Svetlana says Alina was less interested in showing and many other things than the missionary career.
Alin was often said that when she is so she seemed like she should start as a missionary.
But she announced she wanted to be a radio pilot.
It was later that Alina inspired the beauty contests.
The parents' hope was that Alina would get to the university before attending the Miss Suomi race.
That's what happened, and eventually Alina still wanted to do a Scandinavian degree before the missikisoja.
We already questioned last year why she wasn't involved, but she wanted to make it Scandinavian.
Parents believe Alina won the race because she is a healthy example for young people and adults.
She sports a lot and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be up, it's visible.
Alina's boyfriend, Joonas Hurri, is hockeying for work in Japan, and didn't get to Finland to encourage his loved ones in the final.
Alina's parents believe the relationship between young people takes a missionary year.
Yes, that's what it's supposed to be!
Parents hoped the daughter would soon be able to walk.
Now there has been such a long break in visits because of missiles.
It's already boring, although messages have been produced.
Young man died in Lahti - police captured three people
Three people have been arrested as a result of the incident, according to the police.

Police also didn't comment on whether the attacked persons and the man who died in the limbo knew each other.
More information on the case will be available early next week.

Sari Piippo abandoned her career in Brussels and became a home maid in Finland - a pipekahti idea of cartoon: lack of drawing skills didn't slow down
The organic couple once left my husband's song, in which he suggested it as a person for me to develop a story, tells Espoola's cartoon blogger, housewife and former EU translator Sari Piippo.
Sari Piippo tells himself to be an EU translator for economic and legal affairs in Brussels until after a fourth child, the family became a ten-year-old returnee.
I'm entertained as a home-made thing well.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it came to mind that what a father would do when even the smallest child already began to be big.
Then, in 2014, the photo became a cartoon.
Piippo says he had never dreamed of making a cartoon, although he had read Aku Ankka, Tintti and Asterix as a small one.
I was drawn last as a child, but when these manuscripts began to emerge, then the situation changed.

Piirtolevy is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something done.
For the paper, I wasn't even trying to draw, tells Piippo about his relationship to draw, which he usually practices in the evening.

Indonesian earthquake: the director of the aircraft sacrificed himself - didn't leave a cracking tower until hundreds of passengers were secured
Anthonius Gunawan Agung, a 21-year-old flight director, has risen as the hero of Indonesia's earthquake.
Agung was left alone in the air traffic control tower until the hundreds of passengers carrying hundreds of people were safer to travel from the island shaken by the earthquake.
The youngster was in charge of the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in the city of Palu when the earthquake struck on Friday.
When others escaped from the air traffic control tower, Agung refused to leave his seat before getting guided from the Batik Air passenger aircraft runway.
That's how he could save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian Aviation Administration told AFP.

Rehn réfléchissait à la fin de l' Europe à son trafic: "Need to watch the next twiitti"
Trade between the United States and China is reflected in the global economy as a whole.
Growth forecasts have been calculated across Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly reduced its own economic growth estimates.
Chief executive Olli Rehn said in Ylen's department store that, though the tightening tension doesn't directly affect European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which in turn reflects companies' investment decisions.
The situation also concerns exports of Finnish companies.
For the time being, Mr Rehn considers Europe to be very playful.
It has been able to build a peace of mind with the United States and contributed to calming the situation with China and Japan as well.
Europe doesn't seem to Rehn's frustration in the legs of the trade war.
Keep looking at the next twiitti and then estimate.
We have a timeless partner in Washington's direction, however, he said in Ylen's interview.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is Italy's third-largest national economy in the euro zone, which is also one of the most indebted states in the euro zone and the whole of the western world.
Yesterday, the market reacted harshly by the Italian government on Thursday night to present a clear deficit budget.
Next year's deficit is more than 2.4% of the population's production.
Rehn considers Italy's situation worrying.
Five per cent of the country's lending stock constitutes problem credits and non-organised credits represent more than 10 per cent.
In addition, its public finances are in weak positions and the country seems to be once again exceeding its commitment to its European partners.
Maybe it's not worth painting yet new crises, Rehn answered when asked about Italy's new economic crisis in Europe.
Another thing that tries Europe is Britain's difference from the EU.
Rehn hoped it would fit.
The disputed difference would become much more negative.
Rehn started as chief executive of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, chief executive of the European Central Bank (ECB), will withdraw from his mission in a fair year.
The conversation with his successor has begun.
Both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikasen's name has spilled in speeches.
Surely it wouldn't hurt if there were Finnish names involved, Rehn said, adding that he wasn't going to comment on the matter beyond that.

During the evening, journalists and photographers appearing on the scene tell you they have long been preparing a tositar, which has not been published previously in any HS instrument.
There's something involved again, something nobody's guaranteed to ever hear.
"It's a strange spy at night in Helsinki, an impressive reportage from one side of the globe and a talking story about a very topical health issue," explains Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the performance, the audience will have the opportunity to meet HS journalists and photographers and continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has held live journalism evenings for three years.
They've been popular and often finished sellers since the beginning.
More than 15,000 people have already visited.
The black box was rewarded in Bonnier-gaalas as an act of journalism.

Lost mushroom found thanks to "unprejudiced experiment"
Finland's police drone competence is the world's top: "We're being asked for training"
In addition to searching for missing drones, police can use drones in criminal investigation and intelligence tasks, according to a reporter at the Poliisiammattikorkeakoulu.
Oulu's police managed on Tuesday to find a missing mushroom drone in Raahes in just a couple of minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, the reporter of the Polytechnic School, filed the case and mentioned, among other things, that "through unprecedented experimentation and effective training, we are at the forefront of the world here too."
The drone is quite a new capsule and even the newer in police duties.
There are no statistics that the police in Finland would be a champion of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong perception that this is however the case.
This has survived, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported in international events.
Terribly interested in it is elsewhere, Himberg says.
It would be hard for visitors to look at the Finnish police's drone operation.
We're asked about training.
More generalized
Himberg recalls the importance of finding out what's missing in Finland's winter conditions as soon as possible.
As has been said, in Raahen's case, the eccentric was found with drone in just a few minutes.
Already hundreds of drone pilots have been trained by the Finnish police.
According to Himberg, they're supposed to be trained more.
Already, a lot of drones are being used in police duties, and their use will increase and increase in the future.
That's what I would say, Himberg tells.
In addition to searching for missing persons, Himberg says police may use drones, for example, for accident or criminal investigation and for certain intelligence tasks.
For example, it's already supposed to go a little further in revisiting some area, where it's possibly fearful that violence is being faced there.
Dronea can then be used for preliminary inquiry.

Karelia's Rugby rose to the unicorn

The Joensuulais were still in the middle of the match with a 7-12 loss to the Helsinki Rugby Club, but found a second episode of train and covered southern guests 26-12.
At the same time, the 2-division championship knew the historic rise of Karelia's Rugby to the 1-division.
Previously, the club has played in the individual, but at the time, the Finnish rugby's serial action was divided into two levels, the SM series and multi-pilot 1-division.
The club are going to take the series, but it knows quite a lot of work next winter.
The current roster of nearly twenty players must be increased to 25.
The 1-division also knows the increase in the number of games and longer game journeys, so also the spending must be consistent with it.

What's a good leader like?
There has been a lot of talk about leadership in Finland this week.
Risto Siilasmaa, the chairman of Nokia's government, told HS's interview about his book, Paranoidi optimistic, in which he shed light on his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticises the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Ollila.
Ollila sharply disputed the accusations, but previous Nokia surveys have talked about the inability of managers to act as a team; fear and speechlessness, partly causing the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The company's rising phase of risk-taking and kettery disappeared.
The week in Helsinki also hosted a business leave event Nordic Business Forum, which vetoed Messukeskukse Finland's business life club.
In addition to Barack Obama, 12 bisnes world stars rose to the laval.
The talk of good leadership was enough.
Gary Hamel, legend of leadership, said that a good manager should dare to export the company to the future even when the company goes well.
The problem is that decisions are taken by those who are mentally most tied to past decisions.
John Mackey, founder of the wide range of organic Whole Foods trading package, said the manager should share a message to the entire staff for the company's purpose.
And the purpose of that cannot be simply to make a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote about Menestyskirja's introvers, said that the most successful leaders are investigatively humiliating.
They work calmly, quietly and determinedly.
Often they're introvert.
Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor, recalled that the qualities of a good manager should coincide with one phase of the company's life cycle.
In the early stages of the company, the director must be able to tell the story on which the future of the company is based.
A mature company needs a manager who knows the numbers.
Those doctrines at the Nordic Business Forum were listened to by 7,500 visitors - essentially Finnish leaders.
They were at risk of being informed.
There's a lot to be demanded from a good leader.
That's why leadership so often goes to piele, even at the highest level.
Siilasmaa and Ollila were also present.
They thrashed each other in the scenes.
But hardly they wondered if they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humiliation wasn't easy to estimate from outside.

Macedonia's name has caused decades of divorce - now the people vote on the matter in contentious elections
Macedonia, situated in the Balkans, is currently voting on the proposal to become the country's new name.
According to the Macedonian and Greek governments "agreement", the Republic of North Macedonia would become the name.
Until now, Greece has blocked Macedonia's efforts to become a member of NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, Macedonia's name belongs to its northern province.
The question of the referendum does not mention a new name, but asks whether the voter supports Macedonia's membership of the EU and NATO by approving the agreement.
The vote began online at least at the school in the centre of the capital Skopje.
Olivera Argirosvka, a retired nurse voting at the school, hoped the agreement would be supported.
The referendum marks a change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
It means change, especially for young people, she said.
In 1991, Macedonia's independence has been used in official contexts as the Republic of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaevin's government has campaigned for the agreement to be approved.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, it's sufficiently exciting whether the voting turnout will rise above the 50% required.
The referendum is not binding, but the victory of a yes vote would allow the mandate to change the constitution.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament is needed to amend the Constitution.
The Greek Parliament, too, still needs to approve the deal.

Trump has said that Canada's involvement in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that there are plans to sign an agreement at the end of November - whether Canada is involved or not.
Because of these timetables, the agreement text between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday to leave sufficient time for the us Congress to assess it.

Students show a rare sensation: ancient tragedy - feared Oresteia affects its visuality
Ancient tragedies are a rare sensation in Finnish scenes.
Par exemple, the National Theatre has recently seen ancient tragedy, Sofokleen Filoktetes, in 1988.
Now theatre college brought the antique's only entirely preserved sampling logic, Aiskhyloksen Oresteian, to a tour starting from Kansallisteatter.
In 2015, Lavat opened! projects, academic students at the Academy of theatre college work together with a professional director internationally.
Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin, is the director of this fourth project, as is the first.
Oresteia, her international first night, was awarded in Berlin in April.
Roiha's arrangement for Oresteia summed up the report on the end of the bloodstream of Atreus, who was sentenced to destruction, and the birth of the rule of law was earnestly honored to twenty minutes, particularly by summarising the choir shares.
The book succeeds in being very loyal to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsuuren hienon suomennok (2003).
The dramatic lights and the theatre's sides revealing presentation highlight a spectacular and bright spectacle.

The actors don't exit at all, so, for example, Agamemnon, who returns from the war in Troy, and Kassandran's murders in this war hall, are shown on display, unlike ancient esitystraditios. it was customary.
Such a proposition does not insist on being loyal to ancient esitystradities.
Rather, before the viewer's eyes, a modern, loyal interpretation of the text is created, which is constantly aware of its ritual roots.
Roiha has succeeded in bringing the masterpiece actor students to the fore as a tight group, directly as a single organism, into a rhythmic set.
Particularly in choir shares, very expressive, sculpted group forms, actors easily bent on their rights in bare, only by decorating a white aisle, with a spectacle.
Impressive.
Oresteia's performance tour continues to the Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.

Fists raged on several occasions in Kajaan
A little more than thirty-three-year-old man apologized to three men in a restaurant in the centre of Kajaan and in front of it on Saturday morning.
The man first found one man inside the restaurant, and as a result he was removed from the scene.
Outside, he would push another man to the ground, and in the absence of a third man, the insulter still struck him as well.
Police captured the injurer.
At the police station, the man continued to behave aggressively and would kick another police on foot.
The man also threatened the police with regret and killing.

The case is being investigated in three ways, as well as in violent opposition by an official.

Erika Kähärää, an employment expert at the service industry union (Pam), also spoke in this context.
Criminal statistics don't tell the real situation, he says.
The problem is growing, although employers of course claim others.
There are only clearly serious incidents that go to the police's knowledge, and many of the correct situations of violence remain unreported.
"Of course, businesses have an obligation to statisticize their situation closely on the basis of the employment safety law, but these statistics remain usable internally and their data are not collected at all," he said.
Mental injuries don't end up in the statistics.
There has always been a problem in violent situations that they don't always cause physical injuries.
Despite this, mental traumas can be much more serious than bruises and wounds.
The difference between the situation of violence and the threatening situation of violence is difficult to draw when a certain level of aggressive threat too must be calculated as violence - although there would be no handshake.
Too many people are afraid of their jobs, although the actual act doesn't happen.

The shop has acquired guards.
When shop opening hours were released, there was a visible drowning time on the media about its consequences for the salesmen's safety.
"At the time, many employers organised guardianship services in at least night-time hours and solely to prevent work," Kähärä commented.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is drawn.
This would now seem to have had an effective effect, but this will produce a new negative trend.
When, because of the guarding, the disruptions remained well in possession, a mood emerged that it would be unnecessary to be guarded.
Now, in many places, attempts are being made to find solutions that could eliminate expensive guard services.
Mild regret is a lawyer's court, and it's quite understandable that a seller who has been bullied doesn't want to make an inquiry into a criminal who normally lives in the shop.
But similarly, according to the subparagraph of the law of 2011, mild evil will become under the prosecutor if it happens at the workplace.
I think we need precedent right now.

Sieppi spoke about his resignation for the first time in the Ilta-Sanomien weekend magazine.
The Missikaunotar said he didn't want to open the reasons for the difference more accurately in public, because it's a matter between him and Roope Salmisen.
She said she doesn't have a rush to a new relationship, she's going to focus on herself.
I'm focusing on my own stuff and especially the industry is living my own life on its own, Sara Sieppi told me.

The Pohjalaismies tortured tied to their open spouse by cooling, burning and feeding a vigorous sauce
Pohjanmaa District Court has sentenced a 34-year-old man living in Kokkola for numerous offences committed against his avoidance spouse to three years in prison.
The crime instrument included belt, cable and nippusite.
The law denounced those objects as lost to the state.
Rank's prosecution concerned the suspect of a major rape.
However, this prosecution was rejected by the court.
Kokkola's cause included four evils, grave evils, compulsion, illegal threats, freedom abuse, grave freedom abuse and two injuries.
The crimes took place between March 26 and May 24.
At the end of the final acts, the man was arrested and imprisoned a couple of days later.
On Thursday last week, the court of justice in Ostrobothnia delivered its sentence and ordered the 34-year-old to remain in Vaasa prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also accused of two major crimes of freedom and a brutal rape on 22 May.
However, these charges were dismissed by the law.
The case was dealt with behind closed doors.
However, the court of justice issued a public description of the sentence.
According to Käräjätuomarin, the accused had targeted his spouse with violence, threats and forcibly in situations where this had been tied.
Accused of victimizing the victim with a knife, burning the tobacco, eating a heavy sauce and pouring water and coffee on it.
In his sentence, the court ordered the state to lose criminal tools: belt and cable, nipples, bathrobe belt, knife and water.
Four witnesses
According to the District Court, the parties continued to live together between the acts.
It can be read from the verdict that a large proportion of the main acts occurred at the end of the criminal cycle.
Four witnesses, two women and two men were consulted.
The 34-year-old must pay compensation for pain, säry, suffering and temporary sharks totalling €5800.
That money is hardly available to him, because the convicted person already has creditors from his old age.
The prison sentence is not the first of a man.
Iltalehti does not tell the convicted name to protect the victim's privacy.

Europe under four-point leadership for Ryder Cup
On Saturday, European golf professionals jailed their leadership in a traditional hockey game show against the United States.
Europe leads the Ryder Cupia, playing in Paris, to 10-6 points, while still facing Sunday's twelve double-games.
Europe won three of the four square-ball matches started on Saturday, and in the afternoon's four-game gains were levelled at 2-2.
European leaders were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four pairs of matches they played on Friday and Saturday.
None of the European couples had survived the equivalent before.
On Sunday, the double is aiming for more history.

After the match ended, some 50 HJK supporters rushed to the field and some seemed to be trying to challenge the dispute with Hongan supporters.

The arrangers didn't get the situation to calm down, but police and also riding police were needed to the scene.
HJK says in its announcement that the team's players and agents are shocked by the incident.

JHL anticipates: tomorrow's combat efforts will appear in children's day care and social and health services
In public and well-being sectors, tomorrow's bans on overtime and exchanges are particularly visible in social and health services, as well as in children's day care, said Päivi Niemi-Laine, chairman of JHL.
The effects will be wide, and they will certainly appear in a way that doesn't have enough staff on the ground.
Everyone has to think about how to apply for their children.
The employer's job now is to keep an eye on the fact that the services are playing and that nobody's life is threatened, Niemi-Laine says to STT.
According to Niemi-Lainee, labour shortages also appeared at the beginning of the year, when JHL members were banned on overtime and leases due to contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible through flexibles that staff have not been hired, but that employees have survived or swapped.

The area is so impossible, social and health activities and the technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The effects can vary considerably by industry, region and type of employer, Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen says that the past week has already had experiences, including the Middle and Basic Care Association of Super and the Association of Social and Health professionals in Tehy's similar, three-day operations.
Their effects were pretty low.
JHL's ban on overtime and exchanges applies, among other things, to workers in municipalities, churches, state and private social and health sectors.
For example, family day-care workers are excluded.
At this stage, the work battle concerns nearly 100,000 JHL members.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL's actions may take a long time.
The union is also prepared for other combat operations if the preparation of the redundancy bill continues.
The government should now admit that this is where you're running into the wall and tough.
Jalosen thinks both the ay movement and the government must come against.
It's extraordinary here that hard is already in the yard, though the performance hasn't been given yet, Jalonen updates.
He admitted that in this situation the German presidency would be a significant victory if successful in drawing up a further plan. he also recalled that you shouldn't forget the 18 member states that the Constitution has already been ratified.

Great Coralliria is born with the power of children and adults - in the mushrooms of the performance, you're studying the gestures of mushrooms and seahorses
In other spaces, the Great Coralliriutta collective got its first night in Hamburg last spring and last Saturday it was presented for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the group's previous works, the Great Corallirie is an act built from the beginning to the end, together with the public.
But this time, a clear-cut performance is also being built, refreshing and crystallizing the observations made at the beginning of the exercises.
In the theatre clubs, orchestrated magic is sufficient for children's participants.
The child's perspective has already been involved in the preparation phase of the work.
Still, the Great Corallirie isn't a children's performance, it's a performance that adults and children do in collaboration.
It provides adults with information and observations about the way children receive information and do art.
Children's ability to throw themselves into exercises and joint clips also witnesses the distance between adults and children.
The great Coralliriut is somewhat reminiscent of satubalet, fitness circuit and nature-related awareness-raising, but ultimately reflects in other, non-human conditions around visits.
The great Corallirie begins to explore the movements of corals, as well as those living on the corallirium.
Six different fitness circuits teach, among others, the gestures of cruelty and seahorse.
Finally, there's a barely an hour-long performance, where music, lights, as well as glossy paints and costumes help you familiarize yourself with the life of the coral reef.
There are both diving people in the great Koralliriuta, who observe the life of the coralliriut and the corals being looked at.
There are also bodies looking at corals.
Looks and observations pointed in many directions make the proposition dense and life sparkle.
Ollapa the landscape of some animal, the landscape of the landscape, and the other body or landscape that looks at the body - and all this at the same time.
For children, it doesn't seem like anything difficult.
In other spaces, the group aims at a boundary of thinking and action, which is challenging to get to when the group is composed of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more significant.
After the workshop, Sitrator organises a silent demonstration on behalf of endangered corals.
The devastation that transcends man's understanding should not be allowed to harden, although it could be difficult to comprehend the significance of exercising one's own sympathies in the face of the devastation.

There are other generations, there are different kinds of awareness, other species and their future generations, whose wonder and cut it ravages space.

YLE: authorities told the State Department that the case of Airiston Helmi did not relate to national security
According to Ilkka Kanervan, I'm interviewing, protective police and defence forces visited the Committee on Defence and Foreign Affairs earlier this week.
The Finnish state leadership has been told that Airiston Helme's investigation is not currently related to national security, but to organised crime, Yle announced.
Ilkka Kanerva (kok), chairman of the Defense Committee for Yle, confirmed the information of the anonymous sources.
According to Kanervan, the defence forces and the conservation police visited the Committee on Defence and Foreign Affairs this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is considered primarily economic crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that there would be anything else here, Kanerva commented in Ylen's interview.
According to above, the seized material has so far found no evidence of a link to national security, but the investigation is only on its territory.
We can't yet know what can be revealed from there, one of Ylen's interviewees says.
A week ago, the vast homesmanship that began in the archipelago of Turku and the continent has raised the question of whether the investigation is simply about economic crime or a threat to Finland's internal security.

Video: dream paint saved Liverpool's defeated series
Liverpool's 100% Valioliigan start came to an end, but it was still a more satisfying team for the 1-1 game at Stamford Bridgela.
Sunday will be a level year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and departed for a 1-0 guest victory.
That's when Pep Guardiola's combination sent a signal throughout Valioliiga that City was now in fact.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And certainly Liverpool manager Jûrgen Klopp arrived at the same ideal Länsi-Lontoose.
The Reds had started Valioliigan with six consecutive victories.
Liverpool started stronger and Virgil van Dijk, in particular, seemed to dominate his own field end alone.
Chelsea, in turn, had a fine liigacup guest victory from Anfield Road underneath Wednesday.
Then Eden Hazard rose from the exchange bench to settle the match with a fabulous individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was involved immediately from the early minutes.
In the 25th minute she first blasted in a small space triangle with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Eventually, the Croate saw Hazardin eating ahead and sent this completely weighted unwritten.
Hazard drifted a little to the ship of the penalty zone, but bombed from there a perfect left foot to the back corner of the bet.
Pool's brassivahti Alisson was a little slow in his fight and didn't get like his finger on the ball.
Klopp certainly felt the defeat position lightly unfair because almost immediately afterwards Antonio Rüdiger putsasi Mo Salah's guidance on the ground.
In the second episode, Chelsea-veskari Kepa also got into action.
Baskivahti quickly reacted to Sadio Mané's appeal and pushed the ball from the root of the tolp into a corner pot.
On the other hand, Alisson zeroed in his throw-through of Hazarde.
The guests' best place came in 72nd minute, when James Milner found Bobby Firminon in his focus.
But Brassitähden's bucket was directed towards David Luizi, who saved the fathers' leadership position.
Neither lasted in the 89th minute, when exchange man Daniel Sturridge got free to shoot 25 yards.
Sturridge played in his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed the top corner of the unresistant bet in honor of it.

For a typical debate on the subject, there is a strong opposition to one's own views and another's views.

Josba fought täpär's guest victory
Josba's first guest-game salibandyn Divarissa produced Nurmon Jymy against full three series points.
Josba left Seinäjoki for a home trip with a riemukas 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Nurmo was still leading by goal at the start of the third batch, but Josba applied for compositions and recycled men in chains.
In time, 50.47 brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi drink 6-5 winning goal.
Crucial minutes of balance were played in the icebergs of both teams.
Josban's most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2 + 1).
Kakkosketju was otherwise overwhelming when Teemu Tuhkanen (1 + 1), Jere Kaartinen (1 + 0) and Jere Kettunen (1 + 0) also hit.
Miika Kosonenkin (1 + 0) also played in the cake chain at the birth of her goal.

Enon church Sunday's 200th anniversary
The 200th anniversary of Eno's church will be celebrated tomorrow, Sunday, in part in a very sad atmosphere.
The incineration of the church of Kiihtelysvaara a week ago was a shock.
Eno's church was guarded after the fire on two nights.
Despite the pain, today is still a place of celebration.
Although that's not what anyone would like, Eno's church is now the oldest church in Joensuu's congregation.
The church in the middle of the village has always been Enon's heart despite all the world's municipal and other alliances.
The family starts at Enon church today at 10 a.m.
Then move to the church house to the Karelian pit table.
The programme has a long day of everything, both inside and outside.
For example, the church building can be familiarized with the retired, 37-year-old congressional star of Ari Räsäsen's mentoring.
The church's birthday party also marks the end of one era.
Already abolished, the church house, built in 1982, keeps its doors open today for the last time.
Markku Koistinen, the captain, says, is now in the democratic spaces of the former municipality.
The church house was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has been standing in a healthy place for 200 years already.

Elon Musk steals from Tesla's government spokesman's place - Petos accusations agreed at $40 million
Tesla, an electric car manufacturer, and Elon Musk, CEO of the company, have agreed their legal dispute with the sec, the U.S. Securities Markets Authority.
The sec suspected Musk's perpetrators of securities fraud, and Musk was in danger of being excluded from the company he founded.
But Musk is allowed to continue as Tesla's CEO.
Instead, Musk will have to steal from the Tesla board chairman for three years.
The company is forced to hire an outside government chairman.
Musk is also facing stricter scrutiny.
According to the agreement, Teslan must employ two independent leaders and monitor Musk's communication more closely in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk will both pay $20 million (about €17 million) to reconcile the case.
"The decision is meant to prevent new market failures and the damage caused to Tesla's shareholders," says manager Steven Peikin of the sec.
The case caught its beginning in August, when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might pull the company out of the stock exchange.
Musk also wrote that the company's financing was secured.
Tviitti instantly raised Tesla's share price.
The sec suspected Musk's guilty of securities fraud.
According to the agency, the tviitti was lieutenant and misleading, and Musk had not spoken about the arrangement with the company's other management or potential financiers.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
The sec announced on Friday that it was challenging the company and Musk's law.
Sec told himself that Musk should be sentenced to fines and that he should be prohibited from continuing to operate under the direction of stock exchanges.
The sec's challenge affected investors, and Tesla's share went into a sharp drop.

More than 800 people killed in Indonesia's raid and tsunami
The number of people killed in Indonesia's earthquake and subsequent tsunami has risen to at least 832, reports the country's disaster agency, according to AFP.

Politicians' phone numbers leaked into the hands of disruptives in Britain
Many British politicians were subjected to harassment when their contacts were announced due to flaws in the application's encryption.
The disturbances reached, among other things, the ministers' telephone numbers.
It was an application used in the government's British Conservative Party Party meeting.
Par exemple, Michael Gove, Minister for the Environment, Restaurant and Rural Affairs, driving Brexit, and Boris Johnson, a former foreign minister, faced harassment.
Several MPs received harassment claims.
Because of the app's encryption, the audience gained hands on politicians' profiles, which were on the Conservative Party's annual mobile app.
The audience got into the profiles by using the politician's email address. which was easily accessible online.
The profile-recording managed to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to turn Boris Johnson's profile photo into a porn photo and title solvable for a moment.

Then you can look at the profile person's contact information and even if you send messages in this name.
The meeting app made every journalist, politician and participant's phone number public, Foster criticized.
The Conservative Party informant apologized for the information.
He said that the technical problems have been solved and the application is now operating safely.

The Wall Suomi tournament audience features a large array of populated Poles every week
Eye-catching viewers attracted attention to the reactions of the studio audience of The Wall Suomi.
The world's rapidly spreading American format The Wall ranched as a Finnish version for Nelo last Saturday.
Heikki Paasosen's hosted game show has been described in Poland in the same studio, where other international productions are made in the form.
In the Polish studio, the possibilities of description were exceptional, as the big 12-metre-high game wall of the formate demanded space from the space.
During the start-up period, social media raised the studio audience of the programme, which was operated as Polish.
On Twitter, there would be a debate about whether the studio perhaps understood Polish people sitting in a Finnish game for nothing.
Unne Sormunen, head of Nelose's domestic programs, illuminates the issue for Iltalehti.
She says the studio audience has players' closeness, other Finns, foreign Finns living in Poland, as well as Polish viewers.
The audience is composed of international fans in Finland's production, than audiences of The Wall seasons described in the same production space in other countries.
In Finland, there are such guardians, so-called professionals, who visit different programs in descriptions, Sormunen background.
He recalls that watching the game in itself isn't so difficult, although he wouldn't understand the language in which it is played.
It's easy to distinguish between red and green balls falling from the wall.
But for foreign-language studios, there are interpreters at the scene who are carrying out translation work.
There are two interpreters that interpret the whole time of events as a simultaneous blow to the studio director.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells you what to go through there, for example, and what the situation is going through, Sormunen says.
He compares the situation with how David Hasselhoff was delivered back in domestic production.
A few years ago, David Hasselhoff was involved in Talent Finland's descriptions of us in Finland.
She became the subject of simultaneous expression throughout her life, and she knew everything the descriptions spoke of as Finnish, Sormunen's sum.

Leipäpäivän mother Pirkko Hyvärinen wonders the audience of the event watched by the big salin.
Somehow it thought that maybe not this year so much would come, Hyvärinen reflects on the morning.
In the autumn of 2017, parallel to the Leipäpäivä, the Traktorikynnön SM races were held, so perhaps the expectation would be that the audience could slightly even diminish from the previous year.

Filip Riska, who played in the early autumn probationary period, will continue with Hämeenlinna's HPK for the final season.
The success of experienced Riskan, 33, in the roles offered to him convinced the following.
Filip has played an important role for us in returning starts, in the power play and in the defensive role of the vicious circuit.

Baltasar Kormákur's 2015 direction tells the story of a survivor battle that has been dealt with in grain.
Movies - and documentaries - have been made of tragedy before.
Tosita events are going through here too.
22 years ago, the world's highest mountain took the spirit of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced leaders of expeditions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who served as Weathers' guide.
The spirit of Weathers may have saved the eye surgery carried out before leaving Nepal.
As a result of it and air pressure, he lost his visibility, which is why the top conquest had to be left in the middle.
Rob Hall continued his journey and didn't return anymore.
But Weathers' struggle for life and death had only just begun.
As the storm rose, he eclipsed and no longer found himself back in the camp.
When the man came to search, he was found in such a bad condition that he was not believed to survive.
Weathers was abandoned to death.
But like a miracle on the store, she still got to her feet and found others.
The evil Weathers, who were pale, were thought to continue to die, and once again he was left behind his own happiness.
Obviously, contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers stayed alive.
At some point, even the climbers began to believe in the possibility of being given assistance.
In the film, Beck Weathers is presented by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson are seen in other roles.

The Mediterranean hurricane, or the median, has been named Zorbaksi.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red weather warning to the Attica, Peloponnese, Joonian Islands, Cyclades and Crete regions.
The images taken from the area show plenty of flooding around Greece.

The sea-facing expeditions should be cancelled and even walking should be careful not to see branches or other bulkheads flying on the storm.

Two robotic cars start traffic in Espoo
They were running for the rest of the year and taking passengers, the city of Espoo informs.
Otaniemen's robot cars operate in the role of a bus simulator, as next spring the area is scheduled to start traffic with robot buses.
The project will develop and pilot a year-round robotic vehicle movement, as well as testing the technical performance of vehicles in Finland's circumstances.
The experiment will figure out how robotic cars stay on the existing street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers an opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says Johanna Nyberg, chief executive responsible for traffic management.
For the first time, robotic cars travel completely automatically among other traffic without special traffic arrangements.
An assistant passenger sitting in tears is always responsible for vehicle safety.
The vehicles sensed their environment throughout with several different sensors and assessed whether the driveway was free.
If it isn't, they will interpret whether a discovered obstacle vehicle, bicycle or, for example, snowflake, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, responsible for the development of robot transport.
Robotic cars travel throughout the autumn three days a week: Tuesdays 13-15.30, Wednesdays 10-15 and Thursdays 10-15.
Robotic cars stop at six stops along the route, taking passengers to tears.
Stops for robotic cars recognise the parking lot.

The Mokoma band basisti fell from the valley in the middle of a bow and injured
The Mokoma group will brief you on their Facebook page about the surprising situation at the Tampere Pakkahuone.
The Mokoma band keikka Tampereen Pakkahuone received a dramatic turn on Saturday when the band's basistist Santtu Hämäläinen dropped out of the valley in the middle of the performance.
The situation happened when the band was pulling the final pieces of the evening.
Hämäläinen's wrist broke.
The band informs on their Facebook page.
"You're in the spirit!"
Santtu stumbled yesterday in the Pakka Room from the valley in the last biis and broke his wrist.

Police oversee hunt in North Karelia and Sava
On Friday and Saturday, the East Finnish Police Department conducted hunt surveillance with the Metsähallitukse and the Finnish Riistake Centre in North Karelia and Ylä-Savo, police department's excavators told social media on Saturday Yeah.
The main focus of surveillance was on hunting legitimacy and permissiveness.
Each hunter was inspected by a hunting card and a hunting permit required by the state.
In addition, hunting arms possession figures as well as patrol numbers permitted for self-insulated weapons used in canalisation were examined.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the surveillance and only one hunter was met during the surveillance, missing the required hunting permit.
The hunter was ordered 12 days' allowance for unauthorised catch.
In addition, 133 vehicle drivers were blown up by the police and two of them were suspected of being rattled.
In addition, less than five traffic offences were dealt with in a fine procedure, police once.
To sum up, hunters respect the permissibilities of hunting very well.
Many hunters were surprised by surveillance.
One hunter said that "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone is checking the permits."
The eastern Finnish police department will continue hunting surveillance in the autumn, along with other supervisors.
If I didn't know, I'd think there's a swamp of sixth grade here.

Mykkänen leaves Turkey to watch Syrian quota refugee selection
Interior Minister Kai Mykkänen (kok.) will travel to Turkey in the next few days to monitor the choice of quota refugees coming to Finland.
Finland has decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps this year.
Selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year, with representatives from the Migration Agency, the Ministry of Labour and the Economy, as well as from the police.
The delegation is already conducting interviews in Turkey.
UNHCR, the UN refugee organisation, chooses people in a particularly vulnerable position.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be in refugee camps in a particularly vulnerable position, such as single-parent families, disabled and sick, women and children.
More people are elected to the group of people coming to Finland than the quota is because, in practice, some remain without arriving for different reasons.
Mykkänen will also meet NGOs operating at the border between Turkish Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu and Syria.
Ilkka Salmi, the chief executive of the Interior Ministry, is also involved.
Talked about raising the quota
Finland has taken quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees a year.
The quota was 1 050 per year for a couple of years, but no agreement has since emerged in the government to raise it.
Kokoomus has been in favour of raising the quota, but the project has most recently crashed into blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) recently presented a gradual increase in the quota to 1,500-2,000 people a year.
Mykkäsen's visit during this government season is the first that the Interior Minister will do on the ground to monitor the choice of quota refugees.
Previous interior ministers Petteri Orpo (kok.) and Paula Risikko (kok.) were able to move on to their new duties before the visits were arranged.
Finland receives €10,000 in support from the EU for every particularly vulnerable refugee.
It was so important, anyway, that the shipment should have been killed.
"What does it mean?"
It is unacceptable that such an important sector as internal security policy is outside the control and decision-making of parliament and that democratic transparency does not affect it.

Now you're going to searches - no longer known, whether you're crying or laughing
Karjalainen announced last Saturday a bill to amend the Animal Protection Act.
On the article, it was perceived that the draft bill initially bans the keeping of all animals that are not separately permitted by ministerial regulation as production animals, pets or otherwise associated with business activities. Yeah.
So everything else is originally banned except for the animals specifically mentioned in the regulation.
If the bill comes to an end, it means that we are rejecting in Western democracies the general principle that the laws separately prohibit activities that compromise the safety of society, or the way.
Now, it's a question of prohibiting everything that the law or regulation doesn't separately permit.
The result of the change is that nothing new can be tested, for example, in business activities, and nothing else can be done before its adoptive law or regulation has been adopted.
The government's activities in lawmaking have generally been weak.
Should it now be taken down the road that, in Finland, everything is prohibited, which is not allowed separately, it is no longer known whether to cry or laugh.
I don't doubt the Animal Protection Act would require an update.
But the law in this direction doesn't fall within democracy.
Unfortunately, I don't know the Constitution very well, but whether it may accept such a "everything is prohibited, which is not permitted by law or regulation separately."
Hopefully, there will be some sensible minister who suspends the progress of such a bill.
The score shows a key estimate, and the line shows 95% uncertainty.
The best possible answer would be a ticket - to someone, which certainly happens in a certain place at a certain time.
Metti Forssell tips: four trendiest breasts in autumn

Kimi Räikkönen criticized the cause for Mercedek's superiority over Ferrari
Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen was allowed to admit that the worst competitor, Mercedes, was too hard a piece at the time of Russia's gp.
But there is no reason to panic in the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver estimates.
They were just faster than us, but there's nothing huge about it.
Our car was the best throughout the week-end so far, but they were just too fast, quarter-time and tallitover with Sebastian Vettel clearly missing from the Mercedes boosts, Räikkönen said.
Ferrar had difficulty already in previous cats in Singapore.
Räikkösel was asked what the sudden fall from Mercedek's tears was rightly due to.
They seem to go faster than us - so simple it is.
If I knew the reason for that, we would certainly go at the same pace as they did.
But I don't know it any more than anyone else.
That's always guessing, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Ken knows why?
During time, a rare sensation was seen for Räikkösen's upcoming winter for Sauber.
Charles Leclerc, replacing Räikkösen with Ferrar next season, was seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also appeared in the final time session.
For Sweden's attack, the 10th departure is best for more than three years.
And although in the second driving round five drivers left entirely driven, the end result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging Räikkö's future?
Yes, if you compare where they were from the early season, then the step forward has been big.
There's a different story next year, so let's watch, let's watch.

It was there - Robert Helenius tyrmäsi Erkan Teperin: "Robbe is back"
Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper's match in Stuttgart's evening progressed in flat signs.
The German was in the process of being a more initiative party, but he didn't get a decent hit on the couple.
Clearly more reaching Helenius controlled the match with his hard series, which found themselves very perfect.
The Finnish was also clearly in a better physical condition than Teper.
The solution eventually came in the eighth installment, when Helenius pushed Teperin straight to the left.
The hit was so hard that the conkari who was in front of the home audience didn't even try to rise up from the carpet.
After the victory secured, Helenius fanned quite moderately.
In the Kehäha interview, she initially praised the good atmosphere created by the public and her opponent.
Then, for a moment, she exchanged her tongue of Finnish.
Thank you to all viewers and Finnish incentives.
We were involved in the belt today.
Helenius cheered immediately after the match.
It was a really big victory for Helenius' career.

Rescuers are looking for the remains of the injury, as well as for the perpetrators of the worst affected areas of Sulawes Island: the port city of Palu and its neighborhood of Donggala.

Status symbols don't attract friends - Four facts of favor
What makes people popular, karismatic or admirable?
The scientists at the University of Sydney, which analysed the matter, have described two species of "coolness" composed of slightly different features: the generally charming coolness and the partly opposite dissident coolness.
Fascinatingly cool people, according to the description of the scientists, had many features considered socially desirable: they were outward-looking, friendly, agreeable and qualified.
For dissidents, however, there was a typical distance, independence, rebellion and blur.
They thirsted for experiences and held little attention to the estimates of outsiders.
Both types coincided with good self-consciousness and a stable emotional life.

There's a hurricane storm - weather warning crying red
During the weekend, southern Greece can harvest as much water as in Finland on average over half a year.
The Zorbas storm strikes Greece during the weekend.
Varaudu to it if you are staying in the Peloponnesoksen, Joonian Islands, Kyklaadien or Kreetan region.
The storm is extremely powerful, so the Suomen Ateenan Embassy announces it on its Facebook page.
According to the Major Approach, the Greek Meteorological Service has given the regions a red weather warning.
A weather service in Forecan's blog is also told of the impending storm.
According to it, the storm's hardest trees are up to 45 metres per second.
Because of the comparison, the Kuisma storm, which drank Finland from the early week, blew at its hardest fair 31 yards per second.
However, according to the blog, Zorbas storm's biggest concern is not wind, but hands rain.
Over the weekend, more than 300 millimetres of water may arrive in southern Greece.
It corresponds to about half of Finland's annual rainfall.

Valtteri Bottas tärised and pursued adrenaline in Sochi - will he be Hamilton's helper on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas peeled a little more tens of minutes after his end-of-life Russian gp when he was in front of the media.
The fine round left Lewis Hamilton behind Mercedes's single star and was mentally certainly an important criticism for the Finnishman who collected this season.
Nice round.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left a round of solutions.
Feels good, tärisen little more, Bottas figured out.
I've only been once this year, in Austria (in the middle), so it's been a long time since.
This track has been good for me before, and I got good rounds again.
Sotsh's radar doesn't make it easy to pass, so the departure is particularly big.
And true, when Bottas was allowed to answer the question of whether he would drive a victory tomorrow or whether there was a Hamilton jeesamen approaching the World Cup title.
My starting point is definitely that I'm trying to win.
Nothing else can happen when you leave the balustrade, Bottas flaunted.
But as a matter of fact, we're fighting for both championships.
Lewis' leadership to Sebastian Vettel is quite big and differentiates me very big, so it's keeping in mind.
Look at what's happening, though, Bottas completed.
Hamilton was genuinely happy about Bottaksen's success after the drive, and Mercedeksen's tallipomo Toto Wolffillek's seen taste.
Lewis had plans to win Valtteri, but he didn't succeed.
Valtteri knows he needs to revitalize everything from himself to win Lewis.
And he was so charged that adrenaline pursed out of the ears, Wolff glowed.
Whether the talli Bottaksen and Hamilton's drive would be allowed to rehdistize, Wolff answered in answer.

Syria calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops
The Syrian Foreign Minister demands that the United States, France and Turkey withdraw their troops from Syria.

Muallem said foreign troops were fighting terrorism in Syria, and war against terrorists was "almost over" according to him.

Not quite Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court judge on TV
Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court judge, and Christine Blasey Ford, a professor accusing him of harassment, got an extraordinary amount of people in front of the screens.
The Supreme Court judge's drama of appointment in the U.S. attracted at least 20 million people to his TVs on Thursday.
At the time, Kavanaugh, appointed by Donald Trump, and Blasey Ford, professor of California accusing him of harassment, were in front of the Senate Judicial Committee to tell their stories.
According to preliminary results, the hearings were followed by six main channels: ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox News, MSNBC and NBC, a total of 20.4 million viewers.
In addition to them, the online consultation was followed by several millions more.
NBC announced that 6.8 million people followed live streaming and CNN reported that it had done its record for the year with 8.2 million broadcasts launched.
CNN's chapter will rise to more than 10 million when calculated via Youtube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also achieved 8.0 million launches.
The digital launches are channels' own, the TV watchdogs come from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen publishes the final readings on Monday, but they're humiliating anyway.
Few yields to 20 million
More than 20 million viewer clubs in the U.S. are usually only accessible to sports matches, as well as the big Oscar and Grammy games in the entertainment world, as well as random political events such as presidential speeches and 2016 presidential election. you.
There's certainly a journey to the U.S. 's annual most visited programme, the NFL finale of the American Football League to the Super Bowl.
This year, the Super Bowl collected about 103 million people on the NBC channel.
Last year, Trump's first speech to Congress, according to Nielsen, a total of approximately 48 million people and officials fairly 30 million people.
Top-notch thing
Supreme Court judgeship is an extremely significant case in the U.S., as the posts are lifelong.
Trump already managed to appoint one new judge when Anton's Scalia disappeared from the beginning of 2016 and the Republicans managed to prevent then President Barack Obama from appointing him a successor.
Another place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but on several issues he was so-called vaa'an language, whose voice may have resolved the nine-court position.
She was a supporter of abortion rights and sexual minority rights, and in 2015, for example, she decided, by her voice, that same-sex married couples acquired marriage right throughout the federal state.

Children have the right to access their information to parents
Only parents of children under the age of 10 see their children's health data from the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong and it's bizarre.
Originally, the Kanta service situation was, of course, even more worrying: parents couldn't even look at small health information or prescriptions.
The situation was temporarily corrected in autumn 2016 for the under 10-year-olds.
Since then, practices have been promised to be corrected, but remediation has gone amazingly long.
Now the correction is in perspective - in 2020.
Because the problem is clear, changing the billboard shouldn't have been more than passing through.

In practice, therefore, the sub-school's nelo-class data cannot be seen by anyone other than by asking them to be printed.

According to U.S. medications, the FBI is investigating at least two women's harassment accusations.

U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to clear the accusations at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

On Saturday's anti-Saturday night in Kajaan, the police faced a threat from the suspect's malice.

Aid organizations are preparing to start work in Indonesia's Sulawes - "Clean water is it most urgent"
UN children's organization Unicef and other international aid organisations are ready to help on the island of Sulawes in Indonesia, says Kirsi Haru, head of information for Unicef in Finland.
Local authorities are leading rescue efforts, but the need for further assistance is already evident at this stage.
UNICEF is active in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
Along with normal operation, UNICEF always has a full emergency response capability, Haru says.
The first task now is to find people out of ruins, both survivors and dead.
Rescue efforts are underway in the city of Palu in Sulawes, but the situation in the slightly northern part of Donggala is less obvious.
There are still places where connections do not work.
Assistance efforts are difficult because the roads are different too, says Haru.
Buildings are often lightweight in Sulawes, so the devastation caused by earthquakes and tsunamis is large.
Once the survivors have been found, they need shelter - for example, tents - and clean water.
Pure water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
Firstly, people are mostly able to offer water purification tablets, which Unicefillakin has in stock.
Water systems are being sought to repair as soon as possible, but in the event of an emergency, water is being carried first, for example, on the record.
In crisis situations, many children get rid of their parents.
Looking for family members and reunifying families is one part of UNICEF's mission.
Food aid is organised, among other things, by the World Food Programme (WFP), which serves as part of the UN.
In the early stages, funds collected earlier will be used for emergency aid.
Among others, however, Unicef has already launched a fundraising effort to help victims of Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami.

Billionaire Elon Musk quits Tesla as chairman of the government - $20 million fines twiite
Elon Musk, founder of companies that manufacture space rockets and electric cars, avoids fraud charges in agreement with the U.S. Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk will quit his role as chairman of the Tesla board of electric car company and agree to fines of $20 million.
Musk dodges the task as part of a deal he concluded with the U.S. Securities Markets Authority.
By agreeing, Musk avoids fraudulent charges.
The U.S. Securities Commission sec threatened Musk with securities fraud because of his twites sent in August.
In those, Musk wrote that he was preparing an electric car company to pull Tesla away from the stock exchange, prompting the company's share price to rise rapidly.
According to the agreement, Musk will not be allowed to serve as chairman of the Tesla government for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new "independent member" to its government and take two "independent leaders" to its management team.
Teslan must also set up a committee to oversee Musk's communication.
Musk is allowed to continue as Tesla's CEO.
In addition to Musk's personal $20 million fine, Tesla will also have to pay 20 million equivalent fines to the Financial Controller.
Twites misled investors
According to the sec, Musk's twiits misled investors and Tesla's shareholders.
Musk claimed he would have secured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange as a private stock company.
According to Miljardöör Twiittien, the company would have been bought off the stock exchange for $420 a share price.
Tesla's share price rose more than 10% a day after the Twites, but fell later.
According to the sec, Musk's claims had no basis.
According to the Guardian, he hadn't actually negotiated his claim of funding.
He also had no discussion of withdrawing from the stock exchange with any other management team or government of the company.
On Friday this week, the course fell by 14 per cent, when sec, the securities supervisor, announced a fraud charge.
The news agreement is expected to reinforce the company's course.

At the same time, Jamsen confirms the fact already mentioned by Kirkko Helsing's Twitter account.
Because the account mentions that the last sentence is not the reason for the clock to stop.
Jamsen says the church's clocks don't sound because of the fault.
