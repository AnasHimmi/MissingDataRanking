Eemeli Kouki led Hurrikaan to home victory in the opener - second win for Savo Volley
As many as seven consecutive time the men's volleyball Champions League medals were held by Hurrikaani-Loimaa, who started the season 2018-19 with a home victory, when Raisio Loimu crashed at 3-0 on Saturday.
Eemeli Kouki, the overall player who has returned to Finland from Romania, was the most effective Hurrikaani with 22 points.
There were some tunings abroad, but they never materialise, and then there was a phone call from Loimaa.
Pretty quickly we got the gays agreed, Kouki said.
Like Kouk, Tomi Rumpunen, who played at Loimu, supported Kouk with 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was national team hacker Samuli Kaislasalo, playing on a match-specific contract, with 17 points.
Victory in the opening game is always important.
Many players had experience on the opposing side, and it brought extra to the game.
Our game is not ready yet, but continuing the medal streak is obviously a goal, Kouki said.
The most powerful of Savo Volley
Miro Malatanen was the most efficient of the Savo Volley with 18 points as the team toppled 3-0 over the Vantaa Ducks.
Our game was volatile especially at the offensive end, but luckily we squeeze in the victory.
At least I didn't have any conscious different charging when I was playing against my former team, Moatanen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in Vierema Volleyball 3 in season 2000-01, scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was happy with many things.
The hall was small, which means the atmosphere on the roof all the time.
A good feeling remained after the home opening.
Miro was a conundrum, Sillikin played a good game, Tuovinen said.
Siltala's previous season in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver at Pielavesi's Sammo when Tuovinen was head coach even then.
Thiago Maciel was the Ducks' most effective with 14 points.
Mikkonen again the star of Akaa-volley
Joni Mikkonen, who won the league scoring position in 2012-13, has had a strong start this season too.
The hacker scored 25 points when Akka-Volley took his opening win of the season after toppling Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has got off to a pretty good start from my side.
Sure, today was a loss close, as we were losing the fourth set 17-21.
A wilderness gain was dug out from somewhere, and the fifth lot came in at the same time, said Mikkonen.
The most efficient of the Tigers, who were still in the final matches some seasons ago, was chipper Edvarts Buivids, who scored 28 points.
Countryman Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs supported with 17 points.
Didn't get much grip on the friend's cutter, Mikkonen boasted.
- Be worried boy, this is not execution but teaching.
Finland as world number one in human capital comparison
Finland is at the head of the world in the human capital comparison, according to science magazine Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
During both years, Finland was the number one in the statistics.
In 2016, the top five was nearly the same as in 1990.
Previously, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later Holland ranked one position higher and instead of Canada, Taiwan was on the list.
In 2016, the worst in the comparison were Niger and South Sudan.
When measuring human capital, the level of education, access to education, skills and health of the population are examined.
The World Bank has linked human capital to economic growth.

Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico in check, the local game ended in a scoreless tie
Real Madrid goal keeper Thibaut Courtois was stretchered off against the Glory, and the local match between the two Madrid teams ended in a scoreless tie late on Saturday in the Spanish Football League.
Atletico Madrid's Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were closest to goal, but Belgian guard Courtois took time to fight.
Courtois played three seasons in Atletico on loan when he was Chelsea player.
In the beginning of the week,, he was selected as the goalkeeper of the year by the International Football Association (FIFA).
In Real, Gareth Bale scored the best goal, but his shot went past the goal in the end of the opening half.
After the break, Bale stayed at the bench because of a thigh injury.

The abortion rights now is under attack in the United States - a powerful documentary tells why
The US Senate is currently trying to determine whether Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee nominated by President Donald Trump, can be chosen as one of the nine members of the Supreme Court.
Many in the Republican Party hope that Kavanaugh's decisive vote, known as Roe versus Wade decision that made abortion legal in the US in 1973 could be reversed.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary Reversing Roe shows how the current situation has developed over the years.
As incredible as it feels, the topic is timely also in Finland. 
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (sin) has conducted publicity work against safe abortion, and received different levels of support from the majority of our country's MPs.

Let us move to a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, a coalition of Lutheran churchgoers directed women to reliable abortion doctors.
The argument of the pastor interviewed is sound, but actually not really needed, a photograph of a woman who died of a self-administered abortion is enough.
There were about 5,000 deaths a year in the United States.
The legalisation of abortions was championed by the Republican Party in particular.
Already in 1967, California signed the abortion rights act by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later it was Reagan during his presidential campaign in 1980 who, in a revolutionary manner, began to confuse religion with politics to embolden voters.
His abortion position was also swirled by his successor, George Bush senior.
And the same was done by Donald Trump.
At the heart of the matter, the documentary reaches out to the basis reason for the politicisation of abortion.
When religious organization supporting racial segregation were denied tax exemption, they became politically active.
Abortion was chosen as their hobbyhorse.
Religion has brought exceptional knots to politics.
While writing this, the United States is in the situation where the president, who courted the voices of the religious right with his stand on abortion, has announced Kavanaugh as a nominee to the Supreme Court, who is now charged of sexual harassment by several women.
Kavanaugh may hold the power of scales to decide the rights of 164 million American women and girls.

Israeli army shot seven Palestinians, including two children - large demonstrations on the border
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months as Israel fired on demonstrators in the border.
Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza border on Friday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health says.
The dead include two children: Boys aged 12 and 14, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
According to the ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
89 Of these were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed they opened fire and made an air strike to the border, when the protesters threw Israeli troops with rocks and explosives.
The army says they has begun the use of force so that the protesters do not break down the boundary on the fence or seek to reach the other side.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in Gaza protests since March, when Palestinians began weekly protests at the border.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, there are 12,000 wounded.
The protesters demanded access for Palestinian families to areas the Palestinians had to leave when Israel State was founded in 1948.

Korean leaders or a Congolese gynaecologist?
The President of the United States Donald Trump as winner of the Nobel Peace Prize - the idea may sound suddenly weird, but according to betting odds, Trump is one of the biggest favourites to receive the prize.
The background is Trump's role in getting North Korea to commit to nuclear disarmament, at least at the speech level.
Based on the odds, the biggest favorites for Nobel Peace Prize are South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have met this year already three times and promised to seek a peace agreement between their countries.
The warming between the two Koreas is remarkable, because as recently as last year the intervals were good.
Even so, rewarding Kim, who has spend years with nuclear weapons and who leads his country with an iron grip, would undoubtedly cause criticism.
The recipients of the Nobel laureates awards are revealed from Monday, with Friday the most high-profile, or Peace, award.
If the prize is not awarded to participants in Korean Peninsula diplomacy, one of the top nominees is a Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege.
The respected gynaecologist has treated thousands of women who have been victims of gang rapes in his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and has become a world leading expert in his field.
With his work, Mukwege has drawn attention to sexual violence, which is a gruesome by-product of many conflicts.
The UN refugee agency, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been considered to be a strong candidate.
The Nobel committee has reported that there are 331 nominees for the prize this year.
The names of the nominees are not made public.
Trump himself would not mind receiving the Nobel.
In May, a reporter asked him in the White House whether he felt he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it myself, Trump said with a smile.
I want to get it done.
The prize I want is victory for the whole world, the president continued, referring to the North Korea negotiations.
However, there are facts that make Trump's Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel committee, that decides on the prize, has often paid tribute to people and organisations that represent liberal democracy and multipolar world order - precisely the kind of international cooperation that Trump has witnessed as an opponent.
In the 2000s century three US politicians have won the prize, all of them democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, and Barack Obama in 2009.
Rewarding Trump would therefore require an ideological U-turn from the Nobel Committee.

Fire report in the tunnel: Motorists behaved like lemmings and drove in the wrong direction
Traffic chaos on the number one road at Lohja took place on 8 September.
Traffic in the tunnel area was cut off because of the announcement to both Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that it was a system failure, the fire service sought to bring traffic to normal.
That did not work out very fast, however.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Centre said it can not be opened because there are motorists on the road a bit of shock, driving how it hurts, on-duty fire champion Pasi Kaikkonen told to STT recently.
The motorway was then even driving in the wrong direction, after just a moment of waiting.
When the first one starts working against the traffic regulations, a few others often follow suit, traffic security contact manager Tapio Heiskanen is amazed.
According to traffic regulations, there must be no stopping on motorways and tunnels except for a compelling reason.
Transport security reminds us that you cannot go out and risk traffic in exceptional situations with hasty solutions.
Emergency vehicles must always provide as accessible an access as possible.
Driving in the opposite direction on a motorway is particularly forbidden, as is making a U-turn and cancelling.
The same prohibition also apply in tunnels, where moreover, headlights must always be turned on.
Stopping without a compelling reason is also prohibited, as is parking.
Recently there have even been cases where the driver stopped in a tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this activity, Heiskanen says in the Traffic Security Bulletin.

Ilves supporters would have liked to continue their celebration even though the ship was stuck to the bottom of the lake
Ilves supporters transported by inland waterway ship M/S Tampere would have liked to stay aboard to continue their victory celebration, even though the ship had remained was stuck to the bottom of the lake, says Juho Syrje, who was the captain of the ship at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, which was on its way from Hameenlinna to Tampere, drifted from its route late Saturday evening and was stuck to the bottom of the lake at Vanajavesi in Akaa.
19 passengers and five crew members aboard the vessel were evacuated to the mainland during the night.
No one was hurt in the haver.
Ilves supporters would have liked to continue their celebration on board until morning, but of course it was more sensible to send them to the harbour on a fire service ride and bus home, Syrja told STT.
Ilves fans had been Hameed following the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended with a win for Ilves 4-3.
According to Syrje, the Saturday brew was caused by the the fact that water level at Vanajavesi was about half a metre lower than normal.
According to Syrja, navigation was also hampered by the fact that the nearest fairway sign was covered by seagull droppings, which meant its reflectors were not normally visible in the dark autumn bridge.
No more spectacular crash
The haveri happened on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalme shortly after the ship route had submerged the bridge of the motorway between the Tampere and Helsinki.
According to Mr Syrja, there was no greater drama in the event, because the speed of the vessel was very low at the time of the event and hitting the bottom did not cause any significant crash.
According to Mr Syrje, being stuck to the bottom did not cause any leaks or dents to the ship and in these circumstances the cruises on the ship continue normally.
A diver went to check the ship condition on Saturday morning before the ship was towed away from the shoal.
As a precaution, we are still going to the dock to check that no damage was caused, Syrje says.
Syrja believes that M/S Tampere's next cruise, booked for next weekend, can be handled as agreed.
The ship's cruise season continues until the Independence Day, he says.
No use for ambulances
The emergency department was alerted to the incident on Saturday evening just after half past twelve.

Trump's justice nominee accused of harassment and stalking may miss top job
Brett Kavanaugh, presented as a Justice to the U.S. Supreme Court, may well miss his intended post, estimates programme director Mika Aaltola from the Foreign Policy Institute.
So far at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior at the time of his studies.
According to Aaltola, the suspicions have brought so much political pressure on the Republican Party that President Donald Trump could end up putting someone else in office.
From time to time, it has happened in the United States that the president's nominee for a Supreme Court Justice has caused plenty of controversy.
In that case, the justice nominee has usually withdrawn himself, Aaltola says.
In this way the president has been able to maintain his face.
The nomination would put Democrats in the sway
The Supreme Court of the United States attempted to be above politics, but at least in Kavanaugh 's case, the election of a new Justice has become an extreme politically sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is nominated, according to Aaltola, the decision will likely rain down on the Democrats in the coming mid-term elections in Congress.
It would raise voting turnout among young people and women, who are more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, appointing a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for Republicans.
The opportunity for a nomination does not extend to every presidential term, because in the United States Supreme Court judges are nominated for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request around the age of 70 to 80.
Even among Republicans, some are hesitant about the nomination
The US Supreme Court's nominees for judges will normally be the subject of a background report, Aaltola says.
Even though Trump has only set a week deadline for FBI further investigations, according to Aaltola it can still bring out something substantial. 
Yes, it might.
There is rarely smoke without fire, Aaltola says.
What is certain, according to Aaltola, is that Kavanaugh's suitability or unsuitability for office will still under intense discussions before the Senate makes its decision.
Republicans have a Senate majority with 51 votes to 49, but at least two female Republican senators are thought to be sceptical about Kavanaugh 's nomination.
The most embarrassing thing would be for the nomination to go to the vote and for Republicans to lose.

The woman identified the Salisbury suspect as military intelligence agent
A Russian woman has told the BBC she identified a Russian man suspected of the Salisbury poisonings as an agent of Russian military intelligence.
The woman told us based on photographs that it was Anatoly Tshepiga who works for the military intelligence in the GRU.
Online community Bellingcat and Russian community Insider Russia earlier reported that they had uncovered one of the two men suspected of poisoning to be Tshepiga.
Already earlier, they said they had found evidence that the men's current identities were covert identities.
The BBC team travelled to the Kauko-East to the village near the Russian-Chinese border where Tshepiga grew up.
A woman living in the village recognised young Tshepigan from the pictures published by Bellingcat.
He recognised the same man from pictures of the British police showing a man now calling himself Ruslan Boshirov.
The Russian men are suspected of poisoning the former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with Novitshok nerve poison in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been awarded the Order of the Hero of Russia in 2014.
Russia still denies the suspect's GRU connection.
Earlier in September, in an interview with Russian TV, the men suspected of poisoning said they had been in Salisbury as tourists.

The elderly cast members sote on reform
Now there is a real example about what the change limiter for reform, defined by the government of Sipila, actually means in practice.
The services of Vaala, the municipality of my birth, are provided by Oulunkaare joint municipal authority, with former regional manager of Attendo appointed in 2016.
The leaders of the joint municipal authority warn the the council about the change limiter.
If the spending increase now, the municipality's government subsidies will be cut in the future.
The municipality's central decision-makers cracked down, and most of them are ready for a major restructuring of care for the elder people, which would end the residential care of the health centre's wards and the small unit for memory sufferers.
Home care would be increased, meaning in Vala over long distances, the elderly living in remote villages would be uprooted next to a health centre to be treated "at home".
Attendo trusted the municipality to pay its customers.
The Left in Vaala did not swallow the bad preparation, but organised a good public event with many relatives, family carers and councillors from other parties.
At the sote do county preparation slides, I showed how Vaala municipality already treats the most elderly people at home in the whole of Northern Ostrobothnia.
Carina Western, a local councillor from the neighbouring municipality was also involved.
The local newspaper made a big story about the event, and it again put the Oulunkaare preparations on their hind legs.
Solicitors do not writing in any papers that Attendo has built a new care home in Vala, which now is waiting empty for residents.
There are no other service providers.
The preparers only talk about a service voucher, but they do not tell anything about the level of care it will receive, or what kind of staff structure Attendo will take care of the elderly until hospice.
Without a nurse?
Namely, the fact that the health centre's sites are being closed down because there is no doctor's night emergency call.
Attendo will also rely on doctors at the Vaala Health Centre.
The example of Vaala reveals how central officials rotate the councillors with insufficient information and delegates are injected with their backs against a wall with the change limiter.
This is how the Centre Party empties people of Vaala, for who will voluntarily stay there unsafe to live voluntarily if there is a chance to move away.
Was it one electoral slogan in the centre to keep the whole country inhabited?

Turkish President Erdogan opens major mosque in Cologne
In the German city of Cologne, thousands of people demonstrated when the president of Turkish visiting, Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened one of the largest mosques in Europe.
Several hundred people had gathered on the bank of the River Rein in the morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read in the protesters' placards, and the slogans condemned fascism.
There have been several protests during Erdogan's visit that began on Thursday, and the security measures have been strict.
Some 10,000 people were expected to take to the streets in Cologne in advance to protest, among other things, the Turkey's human rights situation.
Erdogan supporters had also gathered at the Grand Mosque.
However, the police had cordoned off a large area near the mosque for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Mr Erdogan praised the success of his German visit and estimated that it had strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
On Friday, Erdogan and Merkel vowed to rebuild countries' relations that have deteriorated significantly since 2016 Turkey coup attempt.
However, Merkel stressed that there were deep differences between the countries for example human rights issues.
Criticism surrounds the visit
Both Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker and the North Rhine-Westphalia state Prime Minister Armin Laschet cancelled their participation in the opening ceremony as criticism of Erdogan's visit escalated.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, reported come to the anti-Erdogan demonstration from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice of people who cannot take to the streets in Turkey.

Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Journalist Arto Nyberg interviews for example Vesa Heilala live today in his upcoming talk show.
Vesa is in the studio to tell about his upcoming space trip, which he reserved from Virgin Galactica back in 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000, which needed a bank loan to pay.
If the original plans have been true, Vesa would have visited space a long time ago.
But the departure date has been delayed year by year.
Now it seems that after the unlucky test flight in 2014 that claimed the death, things are in a hole.
If all goes well, commercial flights will begin this year or next year at the latest.
Vesa's flight number is 300, meaning his trip will take place about a year after the first departure.
The flight takes 2.5 hours and the weightless space is 5 minutes at 100 km, the Finnish astronaut says the future on his website.
At the same address, he also background his longing for space.

Manchester City continued its unbeaten run in the Premier League when it toppled Brighton 2-0 at home on Saturday.
Defending champions Raheem Sterling and Sergio Aguero secured the sixth win of the season.
Sterling was allowed to direct his fourth hit of the season from a close distance into an empty goal when Leroy Sane found him with a Brighton goal from behind on the 30th minute.
Aguero raised his own Marchment to five, when he sawed the Brighton defence to pieces on the 65th minute.
The Argentinian was able to settle the 2-0 final readings from the penalty spot in an easy way.
With six wins and one tie, City has started the season, leading the Premier League with 19 point catches.

Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Raikkonen and amazed Ferrari: 'Lose a very important driver'
In an interview with Swiss magazine Blick, the British driver of Mersun was asked whether he believed that Kimi Raikkonen's release from Ferrari's services would help Hamilton in the final term.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second chaser Sebastian Vettel by 40 points in the Championship points.
Just under three weeks ago Ferrari reported that Raikkonen would not continue in the stable next season and at the same time Raikkonen announced his move to Sauber.
Hamilton, of course, does not believe Raikkonen would slap the gloves on the counter.
I don't think Kimi will change in the remaining races.
He's an exceptional professional - a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favourite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
For me, it doesn't make sense.

Football's A & M youth SM series championship fight became a complete farce: The opponent arrived with just 7 players
The top league level for the boys in football ends on Saturday with the final round of the season being played.
Before the round that started at 13, the starting points for the championship battle were clear: FC Lahti Academy will have enough to be number one in practice against Vasa IFK.
For things to turn around in the final round, Ilves, who is second in the championship battle, must win PK.
However, even before the start whistle, the Championship for the Swans was confirmed in practice, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with just seven players.
If there had been one less foal, the match could not have started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match at 16-0.
At the break, the Walkers led 7 o / 0.
One reason for the foal's player pool is that the team has played partly with the same players in A & M you-SM series, or P20 series, and the men's second C & B block.
Vasa IFK has played against relegation in Kakscu virtually all season.
In the closing round of the second round on Saturday, Vasa IFK will be forced to win the JBK in a guest match while hoping that Tampere United will lose their own guest match against Kufu in Lake Siilin Toivala.

Serena Williams chuckles at video of her singing in tops - campaigning for breast cancer awareness
Tennis superstar Serena Williams shrugs again.
Now she is campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by posting a video on her Instagram account, in which she sings only hands in front of her breasts, reports news agency AFP.
The song is the 1991 hit I Touch Myself by Australian artist The Divinyls.
The video shows Williams supporting the Australian Breast Cancer Society.
"I recorded The Divinyls' global hit to remind women to regularly do self-help [breast] checks," Williams writes in her Instagram blog post.
And yes, this put me in an discomfort zone, but I wanted to do it because the subject touches all women, regardless of skin colour, all over the world.
Early detection is the a and o of everything - it gambles many lives.
The co-author of The Divinyls song is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project in honour of Chrissy Amphlett.
"She passed away from breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first," Williams says.
The video has now been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was released early Sunday morning.
In the video's comments, Williams is praised for his courage.
Williams dropped out of the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
There is a buzz in the background at the US Open tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams was inundated with the chief judge of the match and, among other things, claimed that much more drastic behaviour was accepted from men than from female players.

Is it worth going to work tomorrow with a little flu?
Here are the facts for and against
Flu season is hot.
Many are guessing whether to stay home or not.
However, it is worth considering whether to go and infect others, as the disease can be contagious even if your own symptoms are small.
In between, flu symptoms suddenly strike, in between, they appear in sneaks.
In the latter option, you may be infecting others already, even if your own symptoms feel small, reports the Prevention Lifeline Publication.
So is it worth staying at home?
According to Prevention, the flu is contagious even when the person themselves has no symptoms.
The virus is transmitted as early as the day before symptoms begin and from five days to a week.
Children may infect the disease longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you shouldn't be at school or at work.
You can go back to work when the cough eases and there is no fever anymore, says Professor of Medicine Gregory Poland.
You should also avoid exercising.
Too fast a return to the hall slows the recovery.
In addition, remember to wash your hands, stab in a handkerchief and throw the rag papers in the garbage.
Hurting the movement though?
If you have to leave your home sick, consider wearing a protective mask.
The mask does not contain viruses, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
Then you won't put your fingers in your nose or mouth, "Poland says.
The sneezes are also limited to the mask.
How, then, to escape infection?
The best way is still to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
But the latter is hard to escape.
For example, the average person in the United States touches his eyes, nose or mouth every 15 to 30 seconds, Poland warns.

New Miss Finland repeats mission tradition: "My husband is a hockey player"
The hockey player and mission are often linked.
This was also the case with Alina Voronkova, 23.
Alina Voronkova, from Pertunmaa, has been awarded the 2018 Miss Finland crown for her designs.
The beauty lives in Lahti today, where she moved to when she was 15.
Alina's mother is inker-Finnish and her father is Russian.
Voronkova, a father from Russianism, was bullied at school.
Mother and Father moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied because of my Russification.
In Pertunmaa I had no friends at all, "Alina tells the publication of the semi-finalists of the Miss Finland contest.
After secondary school, Alina decided to start from a clean sheet and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon the mission beauty found new friends and the everyday set out to roll as desired.
Back then, at the age of 15, she imagines herself to be an adult, but in retrospect I really wasn't.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Joonas Hurr, who is familiar from the Pelicans' ranks.
Since his SM league career, the hockey player has played abroad, as in Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was on the Finnish team at the World Championships for those 18 years old.
In the early days of dating, the couple lived nearly a year in a remote relationship, but later Alina got to travel with her husband to the world.
If I got into the winning trio and with it a career that would strike me, then I don't want to believe it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we have to live apart, then we have confidence well and the advantage in the distance is that the initial spark stays over the full-time, "Alina vented in May.

Lehblade showed his understrength skills, playing position not yet certain
Jori Lehtera's strong understrength play emerged when his NHL assistant, the Philadelphia Flyers, played their last practice match of the pre-season.
Philadelphia won Boston 4-1, and Lehtar assisted Michael Raffl’s two goals.
In recent days, Lehblade has been featured as a drug due to suspicion.
MTV reported on Wednesday that Lehblade is one of 23 suspects in a drug scam in which some are suspected of drug use and some are suspected of selling, for example.
Lehteja has denied committing the crime.
The club and the player have discussed the issue and the NHL is investigating the incident.
Sam Carchidi, the Philadelphia Inquirer who follows the Flyers closely, estimated after the match that Lehblade belongs to a group of six attackers, five of whom will get a spot on the NHL All team.
In the training match, Lehtar was excellent, according to Carchid.
In the second, Lehtar battled the puck to himself with substrength, pulled the defender over and fed Raffl, who had been waiting in front of goal, to the open spot.
The second time the duo's cooperation brought a goal right at the end of the match.
The Flyers start the NHL All season on October 4 with a guest match against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defenseman Urho Vaakanainen is waiting for the team's coaching management to decide whether he will be eligible for the NHL All-Star team.

Ex-managers demand unpaid fees from Robert Helenius
Boxer Robert Helenius's tonight's match against Erkan Teper is overshadowed by a dispute over money.
Evening Sanomat today news of a bailout application filed by boxing manager Jaakko Helmisen and vice judge Jussi Kokkila, which charges Helenius with interest in arrears a total of just over 80,000 euros in unpaid manager fees.
According to the summons, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius on April 15, 2014 on April 30, 2015.
We have tried to mediate, but there is no other option.
There was a clear assignment here, and a lot of work has been done, Kokkila says to Ilta-Sanomat.
Markus Sundman, the current manager of Helenius, sent a reply to the Evening Standard stating the boxer's view of the events.
Helenius denies being obligated to pay the required amount.
According to the statement, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services to Helenius in financial predicament and promised to arrange matches and sponsor income for him.
Verbally, it was agreed that Helenius is obligated to pay commissions only percentages for his matches.
It was repeatedly asserted that Helenius had nothing to pay, only to receive the income they arranged.
This is also normal and the only practice in professional athlete management.
Paid work has never been agreed and that would also have been absurd in Helenius's situation, Sundman explains in a message he wrote.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
The response was that Helenius would have liked to agree on the distribution of income in writing from the start, but Kokkila and Sundman did not get the draft until late 2014.
He found the proposal poor on his part and cut off cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius did not buy once in his dealings with Kokkila and Helmic.
A year after the end of the collaboration, a "detailed but substantial" invoice had been issued to Helenius for the manager's work.
The same allegations have been brought this year.
Helenius considers the post-Helmic and Kokkila activities to be cowardly, the response states.
Helenius will face boxing federation IBF heavyweight challenger Erkan Teper in Stuttgart in the seventh.

A heartfelt man and a good journalist
The entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the late radio presenter and journalist Erkki Pullin for decades.
Erkki Pulli, a longtime radio presenter and journalist, died at the age of 83 from incurable liver cancer.
The presenter's death notice was published in Sunday's Helsingin Sanomat.
The announcement says Mr Pill died on 3 September.
Mr Palli reported the serious illness on his Facebook blog in March 2018.
The publication was also seen at the time by Ile Vainio, who was saddened by information about the fate of an acquaintance.
He already left on Facebook like a farewell, says Ile Vainio.

As I progressed to making records as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions when Erkki Pulli was a standard editor at every party doing the stuff about artists.
He was always knowledgeable and I saw how big a fire he had for entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he reached directly into the skin of those he interviewed.
He was a cordial man and a good journalist.
To many, he became familiar as a respected radio presenter for Yle, but he also wrote brilliant newspaper stories.

Svetlana says that Alina, as a small person, was more interested in acting and many things other than her mission career.
Alina was often told that when she's so pretty you should start a mission.
But he indicated he wanted to be a radio presenter.
Only later was Alina inspired by beauty contests.
The parents' wish was for Alina to go to university before attending the Miss Finland contest.
That's what happened, and eventually Alina still wanted to do her Bachelor degree before the Mission Games.
We were already asking last year why he wouldn't participate, but he wanted to make it to the end of the cover.
Parents believe Alina won the competition because it is a healthy example for young people and adults.
He sports a lot and eats healthily.
And Alina likes to be featured, it shows.
Alina's boyfriend Joonas Hurri is playing hockey for his job in Japan and couldn't get to Finland to encourage his love in the finals.
Alina's parents believe the youth's relationship will last a mission year.
Yes that's the intention!
The parents hoped the daughter would have time to visit soon.
Now there has been such a long pause in visits because of mission rush.
It is already a shame, even though messages have been put.

Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels to become a stay-at-home mother in Finland - the idea of a comic fell to mind: The lack of drawing skills did not slow down
The character fool once left my husband's post, where he suggested it as a person for a story I developed, "says Sari Piippo, an espoo-based comic blogger, housewife and former EU guru.
Sari Piippo says she was an EU-translator in Brussels as an economic and legal affairs, until the family’s fourth child was born ten years ago and they became returning migrants.
I have enjoyed being a housewife really well.
This has been the best time of my life, but it came to mind at some point that what a big one would do when even the smallest child started to be big.
Then in 2014 came a cartoon.
Piippo tells me he had never dreamed of making a comic, even though he had read Donald Duck, Tintin and Asterix from an early age.
I had been drawing last as a child, but when these Luomumuhempi manuscripts began to emerge then the situation changed.
I first made some dozens of manuscripts into a drawer.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is an accomplished plotter, but I couldn't get her involved until the summer of 2016 when I donate Viivi with the help of a drawing board.
His passion lasted a dozen strikeouts, and then he had to start trying himself, "laughs Piippo, who says the drawing board was a great encouragement to him.
The drawing board is an easy and convenient tool to try and get something done.
On paper I didn't even try to draw, "says Piippo of his relationship with drawing, which he usually practises in the evenings.
Manuscripts pop into the mind constantly, but usually I don't make ready at once.
Up to several hours go into one strip of three squares.
I might do a screen at a time and be happy to play with colours.
Starting a draw is always the hardest because drawing is not my strongest type.
Sari Piippo says she appreciates the Dilbert of Scott Adams among the contemporary comics in newspapers.
The character jumper's persona is an L-teeman-ruffled carrot body with a salad wash.
Other people are Male, Pissis and Twins.
In the world of the character jumper, man is what he eats.
The ideas in the series come from one's own life and social media.
Sari Piippo doesn't want to preach or offer a straitjacket, though Luomumuhemppa occasionally invades the subject.
Piippo says she read her series with her husband and children.
After all, it is such a wonderful feeling when you look at the comic he has drawn and say that this is what I have done today.
And challenges are enough for the housewife!

Indonesia earthquake: Air traffic controller sacrificed himself - failed to leave cracked tower before getting hundreds of passengers to safety
Anthonius Gunawan Agung, a 21-year-old air traffic controller, has emerged as the hero of the Indonesian earthquake.
Agung was left alone in an air traffic control tower until he was able to escort a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people safely off the earthquake-ravaged island.
The youngster was on the air traffic control at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in the town of Palu when the earth quake struck on Friday.
As others fled from the control tower, Agung refused to leave his seat before getting the Batik Air passenger plane to air from the runway.
This enabled him to save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian Aviation Administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport on Saturday after the earth quake.
The control tower was shaking and cracking.
Eventually, Agung tried to save himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg was broken and he suffered serious internal organ injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was to be transported by helicopter to a better equipped facility, but perished 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, an aviation administration spokesperson told The Jakarta Post.
The quake intensified further after the flight was released into the air and its intensity was eventually measured at 7.5 magnitude.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian Aviation Administration has paid tribute to Agung's heroism on social media.

Rehn ponders General European ending to trade war: "Let's look at the next tweet"
The trade war between the US and China is reflected throughout the global economy.
Growth forecasts have been lowered across Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly lowered its own economic growth estimate.
Chief executive Olli Rehn said at Yle's number one morning that while the tightening tension has no direct impact on European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which in turn is reflected in business investment decisions.
The situation also applies to exports from Finnish companies.
For the time being, Rehn thinks Europe is very playful.
It has been able to build an interim peace with the United States and has also contributed to calm the situation with China and Japan.
For Rehn, Europe does not seem to be grinding to the feet of a trade war.
Keep a look at the next tweet and then judge.
We have a pretty unpredictable partner in Washington direction, "he said in an interview with Yle.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is Italy, the third largest national economy in the euro area, which is also one of the most debt-ridden countries in the euro area and in the Western world as a whole.
The markets reacted violently yesterday to the Italian government's clear budget deficit presentation on Thursday afternoon.
Next year's deficit will be over 2.4% of the national product.
Rehn finds the situation in Italy worrying.
Five per cent of the country's loan stock is problem credit and over ten per cent is unstructured credit.
Moreover, its public finances are in a weak position and the country again appears to be exceeding its commitments in relation to its European partners.
It may not be worth painting yet more crises, Rehn replied, when asked if Italy would take Europe into a new economic crisis.
Another issue that is affecting Europe is Britain's departure from the EU.
Rehn hoped it would be in harmony.
A contentious split would have a much more negative impact.
Rehn started as chief executive of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), will step down after just over a year.
The debate about his successor has begun.
Both Rehn and his predecessor, Erkki Liikanen, have had their names flashed in speeches.
No harm, I suppose, if Finnish names are involved, "Rehn said, adding that he would not comment further.

HHS's super-popular Black Box shows will resume next week - last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
Popular Black Box Shows, organized by Helsingin Sanomat, will continue again in the week ahead.
Other performances will be seen at the National Theatre on October 2, 8 and 11.
October 23: The Black Box visits the Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets for sale to the National Theatre.
The Tampere presentation is sold out.
Tickets are sold by Lippu.fi.
During the evening, journalists and cameramen on stage will tell a true story they have long prepared, which has not previously been published in any of the HS instruments.
Again, there is something involved that no one has ever heard with any guarantee.
"There's a strange spy in the night of Helsinki, an impressive reportage from the other side of the globe and a telling story about a very topical health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the performance, the audience will have the opportunity to meet with the editors and photographers of HS and continue the conversation.
Helsingin Sanomat has been organising evenings of live journalism for three years.
They have been popular from the start and often sold out.
More than 15,000 people have already visited the grandstand.
The black box was awarded in Bonnier-gala as the journalistic act of the year.
The reporters praised the new way of doing journalism and the willingness of journalists to come close to their readers.
Spring 2019 Black Box will be seen in the National Theatre on March - April.
The show will also visit Tampere and Turku.

Lost mushroom inhibitor found thanks to 'open-minded experiment'
The Finnish police drone driver skills are the top of the world: 'We are asked training'
According to the rector of the Police Polytechnic University, police can use a drone in addition to the search for the missing, for example in crime scene investigations and intelligence missions.
On Tuesday, Oulu police managed to find a missing mushroom inhibitor in Rahe using a drone in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, rector of the Police Polytechnic University, tweeted about the case, citing, among other things, the fact that "through open-minded experimentation and effective training, we are the world leader here too."
The drone is quite a new capsizing and even more so in police roles.
Nowhere are there any statistics that the Finnish police are master of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong belief that this is the case, however.
This has survived, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police were reported at international events.
There's an awful lot of interest in it elsewhere, "says Himberg.
It would be hard for visitors to watch the drone activity of the Finnish police.
We are asked about training.
Becoming ever more common
Himberg recalls that finding someone missing in winter conditions in Finland as soon as possible is very important.
As noted, in the case of Raahen, the stray was found by a drone in just a few minutes.
Finnish police has already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
There are plans to train more of them, according to Himberg.
Already, drone use is high for police purposes, and its use is becoming more frequent and increasing in the future.
That's how dare I say it, "Himberg explains.
In addition to the search for the missing, police can use drones in areas such as accident or crime scene investigations and certain types of intelligence.
For example, you already have to go and check an area a little further away where there is a potential fear of violence there.
The drone can then be used for preliminary intelligence.

Karelia Rugby became number one diver
On Saturday, Karelia Rugby celebrated the victory of the division 2 in Kuopio.
The river-goers were still halfway through the match with a 7-12 defeat to Helsinki Rugby Club, but found a plot during the second period, defeating their Southern guests 26-12.
At the same time, the Division 2 championship knew the historic rise of Karelia Rugby to Division 1.
In the past the club has played at number one, but at the time the Finnish rugby league action had been divided into two levels, the SM series and a multi-block 1.
The club plans to take over the series venue, but it knows about a lot of work next winter.
The current roster of just under twenty players must be increased to 25.
Division 1 also knows the increase in the number of games and longer distances to play, so fundraising has to be in line with that.

Kotkaniemi starts season in Montreal, confirms head coach
Claude Julien, head coach of the Montreal Canadiens, who plays hockey in the NHL, confirmed on the club's Twitter account that Finnish attacker Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal reserved superpromise for Kotkaniemi, 18, in the first round at number three in the summer booking session.
The attacker joined Montreal in training strength in late summer and has presented strong shots at September training matches.
In his first training match, Kotkaniemi managed to score a goal.
Head coach Julien praised the Finnish for taking big steps forward after arriving at the arrival camp.
The regular season of the NHL begins on the night of Thursday next week, Finnish time.
Montreal will face Toronto Maple Leaves in the opening round.

What is a good manager like?
A lot has been said in Finland this week about leadership.
In an interview with HS, Risto Siilasmaa, the chairman of Nokia's board, told of his book Paranoid Optimist, in which he sheds light on his philosophy of management.
At the same time, he criticises the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Ollila.
Ollila strongly denied the accusations, but previous reports from Nokia have talked about the inability of managers to act as a team; the fear and lack of speech that partly caused the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The risk appetite and agility of the company's upswing disappeared.
This week also saw the launch of the motion-life giant Nordic Business Forum in Helsinki, which drew to the Fair Centre the Finnish business more the cream of life.
In addition to lead star Barack Obama, 12 business world stars took to the stage.

The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most mentally tied to decisions of the past.

Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance, recalled that the qualities of a good manager must coincide with the phase of a company's life cycle.
In the early stages of the company, the director must know how to tell the story on which the future of the company rests.
A company that has grown to maturity needs a manager who knows the numbers.
These doctrines at the Nordic Business Forum were listened to by 7,500 visitors - mainly Finnish leaders.

Macedonia's name has caused decades of discord - now the people are voting in contested elections
A vote is currently taking place in Macedonia in the Balkans on a proposal for a new name for the country.
Under the agreement between the governments of Macedonia and Greece, the name would be the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
So far Greek has blocked a veto on the "hit legal" Macedonia's efforts to join NATO and EU.
According to Greece, the name Make belongs to its northern region.
The question of the referendum does not mention a new name, but asks whether the voter is in favour of Macedonia joining the EU and NATO.
Voting started sluggish at least at a school in the centre of the capital Skopje.

Erkan Teper knocked out by Robert Helenius
Robert Helenius faced off late Saturday at a pro boxing match against Erkan Teper in Germany.
The 34-year-old Finn took the measure from his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch in Stuttgart.
The main match of the evening was the IBF-League heavyweight Intercontinental title match.
For its winner, the chance to take the match as seen on Saturday can be opened up in tougher positions of considerable economic importance.
Helenius settled the match in the eighth period, when he knocked Teper out with a hard left-handed strike.
The teper was no longer able to get up from the floor.
"Nordic Nightmare" hurt her opponent in the third period, when blood began to flow from the German's nose.
Helenius and Tepper met in the ring for the first time.
They were supposed to be dating as early as December 2015.
That's when Teper pleaded guilty to injury and withdrew from the match.
It then emerged that the German had cashed in twice on a doping test.
Helenius has taken the title from 28 matches in his professional career and suffered two defeats.
Tepper, who has gone to the match as the clear favourite, has won 19 professional matches in his career and lost three times.

Canada fights against time to reach agreement on NAFTA with US
Time is threatening to run out in the middle of negotiations between the US and Canada for a free trade agreement on NAFTA.
The United States has set a back limit for Sunday, and negotiators from the countries have been in intensive discussions throughout the weekend.
Canada's chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed her speech to the UN General Assembly in order to focus on trade talks to the fullest.
At President Donald Trump's insistence, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago to reform NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement, but no agreement has yet emerged with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want to bring the agreement into force before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won Mexico's presidential election, takes office in early December.
Trump has said that Canada's involvement in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that there are plans to sign the agreement at the end of November - whether Canada is involved or not.
Given these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday to give the US Congress enough time to evaluate it.

Students show a rare treat: Ancient tragedy - reduced Oresteia affects its visuals
Ancient tragedies are a rare treat on the Finnish stage.
The National Theatre, for example, has last seen an ancient tragedy, Sofocles Philoctetes, in 1988.
Now the Theatre Academy brought the only surviving theatrical trilogy in antiquity, Aiskhylos Oresteia, to the tour from the National Theatre.
In the Lavat Open! Projects, which began in 2015, the Theatre Academy's acting students work with a professional director internationally.
This fourth project, like the first, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
Oresteia got her international premiere in Berlin in April.
Roiha's adaptation of Oresteia summarizes the story of the end of the blood feuds of the doomed house of Atreus and of the rule of law to a creditable hour to twenty minutes, especially by the chorus parts.
The work manages to be very faithful to the spirit of Kirsti Simoniso's fine translation (2003).
The dramatic lights and the unveiling of the theatrical space's pages highlight the simplistic and bright stage thinking.
At its centre is the dynamic between performers who take turns to break out of the choir, who play title roles, and the choir.
The show uses both double and triple talkers for title roles.
The actors do not leave the stage at all, so for example, the murders of Agamemnon, who returns from the Trojan War, and Cassandra, who returns to the spoils, are shown on stage, unlike the ancient performance tradition.
Sure, the show doesn't stress that it is true to the ancient performance tradition.
Rather, a modern, text-faithful interpretation is created in front of the viewer's eyes, constantly aware of their ritual roots.
Roiha has managed to capture the rhythmic array of master stage actor students as a close group, downright one organism.
In particular, actors who bow to the very expressive, sculptural group formations in the chorus sections get their rights with the naked, only adorning the white veil, on stage.
Impressive.
Oresteia's performance tour continues to the Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.

The novelty is starting to show in Europe, thanks in particular to the cooperation agreement with Hyindai and Swiss company H2 Energy.
According to a cooperation agreement published in Hanover's IAA / S commercial vehicle show, Hyundai will deliver a thousand-car batch novelty model for the Swiss company and its partners.
By bringing a fuel-cell truck to market, Hyundai will continue along the path signposted by Nexo and the Ix35 / Tucson Fuel Cell as a hydrogen car manufacturer.
With this first project of its kind in the world, we are taking fuel cell technology further and further.
We will continue to seek opportunities for expanding these vehicles into other markets by for example monitoring fuelling network, Hyundai Motor’s Executive Vice President In Cheol Lee said in the announcement of the contract.

Fists fiddle several times in Kajaani
A man in his thirties just over assaulted three men in and out of a restaurant in the centre of Kajaani on Saturday morning.
The man first punched one man inside the restaurant, resulting in him being removed from the scene.
Outside, he shoved another man to the ground, and in the absence of a third man, the assailant struck him again.
The assailant was apprehended by police.
At the police station, the man continued to behave aggressively and kicked another police officer in the leg.
The man also threatened police with assault and killing.
The man was taken to the creek to calm down.
The case is being investigated as three counts of assault and violent resisting of an officer.
There was also another assault in the centre of Kajaanin on the Central Street on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First the victim was punched by a kayaker aged around 20.
A short time later another man knocked him to the ground and the man who had earlier struck him still kicked the victim.
The assailants were dragged further away from the victim by outsiders and police were called to the scene.
However, the perpetrators had time to leave before the police arrived.
Police are asking eyewitnesses to the incident to contact Kajaanin police by telephone on 0295 416 520 or by email at investigation.kainuu@polici.fi.
There are other forms of control, such as written and oral questions to the Commission and the Council, discussions on the programmes and results of each Presidency of the Council of the Union and the power to set up committees of inquiry.

The safety of shop aunts and sets must be guaranteed
I first got paid for a newspaper story in 1984.
When you get amazed by something on these annual rings, it's usually big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was amazed and even a little angry at moments.
I also spoke to Erika Kahuja, a workplace environment expert at the Service Industries Federation (PAM).
He says crime statistics do not tell the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers, of course, argue otherwise.
Only cases deemed to be clearly serious are reported to the police and many of the correct violent situations remain unreported.
"Of course, companies have an obligation to record their near misses based on the Safety at Work Act, but these statistics remain for internal use and their data is not collected anywhere," he said.
Mental injuries don't end up in statistics.
The problem with violent situations has always been that they do not always cause physical injuries.
Despite this, psychological trauma can be much more severe than bruising and wounds.
The difference between a violent situation and a looming violence situation is difficult to draw when even aggressive threats of a certain level have to be counted as violence - even if there is no access.
Too many people are afraid at their workplace, even if the actual act does not happen.
Some neighbourhoods are troubled.
The store has acquired guards.
As store opening hours were released, the slackening that was visible in the media was pretty big on its impact on seller safety.
"Then quite a few employers organized guard services at least for nighttime hours as well as to prevent working alone," Kraft commented.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is drawn.
This would now seem to have had an effective effect, but this will produce a new negative trend.
When, because of the patrols, the distractions remained well held, the impression was created that patrols would be unnecessary.
Now, in many places, they are trying to find solutions that could eliminate expensive guard services.
Mild assault is a misdemeanour offence and it is quite understandable that an abused vendor does not want to make an inquiry request for a criminal who usually lives near the shop.
But under the same paragraph of the law, which was enacted in 2011, a minor assault becomes subject to prosecution if it occurs in the workplace.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time the shop's aunt or uncle is assaulted, the police should investigate and the prosecutor should be charged.
When the right stabbed a few abusers in prison, and the sentence from there on the hard end of the sentence, the habits would be tidied up.

Heidi Sohlberg joked to the mission before the live broadcast - "Sara, Iiro is married then"
The crowning of the mission will not be seen in the traditional way on TV this year, but will be shown by the Viafree site.
The broadcast will be directed by former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and Iiro Harjula, host of the Viasat and Viaplay NHL and KHL.
The presenter of backstage and the red carpet is Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the trio of presenters told invited guests and media representatives who had arrived on the scene of the broadcast.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a resounding applause.
Now all the women are screaming!
Look at this male presenter of ours now, "Sohlberg gushed as the audience cheered his colleagues.
The front-row races are followed by many Miss Finland from previous years.
Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi, among others, sat side by side and Sohlberg threw a little joke in either direction.
Sara, Iiro is then married!
Sohlberg chipped looking toward Saros.
Most likely, Sohlberg referred to Siep, who had just resigned, as a cast member, laughing at the comment, though he seemed confused at first.
Sieppi spoke about her resignation for the first time in a weekend magazine for the Evening Standard Sanomat.
The missile-beauty reported that she did not want to open up the reasons for the split further in public, as it is a matter between her and Scrooge Salminen.
He said he was in no hurry to have a new relationship, but was going to focus on himself.
I focus on my own stuff and especially start living my own life alone, "Sara Sieppi told me.
Harjula's marriage purchase came up even later when Sohlberg accidentally mistook Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula for a couple.
The presenter trio laughed at the moka.

A bottom-dwelling man tortured his tied unmarried partner by slashing, burning and feeding a strong sauce
A 34-year-old man who lived in Kokkola has been sentenced to three years in prison by the district court of Ostrobothnia for numerous offences against his unmarried partner.
The offender instrument included a belt, cable and zip ties.
The court condemned the objects in question as lost to the state.
Rankin was charged with aggravated rape of a suspect.
However, this charge was dismissed by the District Court.
The inmate was charged with four counts of assault, aggravated assault, coercion, unlawful threat, deprivation of liberty, aggravated deprivation of liberty and two counts of perjury.
The offences took place between 26 March last year and 24 May.
At the end of the last acts, the man was captured and captured a couple of days later.
On Thursday of the past week, the district court in Ostrobothnia passed its judgement and ruled that the 34-year-old must continue to be kept in Vaasa prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also charged with two counts of aggravated deprivation of liberty and aggravated rape on May 22.
But those charges were dismissed by the court as unproven.
The case was heard in court behind closed doors.
However, a district judge issued a public transcript of the ruling.
According to the district judge, the accused had targeted his spouse with violence, intimidation and coercion in situations where he had been bound.
The accused stabbed his victim with a knife, smoked tobacco, fed strong sauce and poured water and coffee over him.
In its judgment, the court ordered the state to confiscate criminal equipment: Belt and cable, zip ties, bathrobe belt, knife and knife.
Four witnesses
According to the district court, the parties continued to live together between the acts.
It can be read from the sentencing panel that much of the most outrageous acts took place at the end of the crime cycle.
Four witnesses, two women and two men were heard in court.
The victim, aged 34, must pay compensation for pain, aches, suffering and temporary harm totalling EUR 5,800.
He hardly has the money in question, for the convict already has debts in the recovery.
The prison sentence is not the man's first.
The Evening Standard does not say the name of the sentenced person to protect the victim's privacy.
A fresh district judgment is not final when writing this.
Now that they know about you, the release of prisoners is off the table.

HJK condemns the savage disruption of its supporters at the Honka person match: 'Violence is not football'
Football's betting league team HJK released a bulletin on Sunday denouncing the disruptive behaviour of its supporters during Saturday's FC Honka match in Tapiola.
"We apologise for the events following the match on behalf of our supporters at Honka-HJK." The release states.
After the match ended, about 50 HJK supporters rushed to the field and some seemed intent on challenging the dispute with Honga's supporters.
There was also a brawl between supporters.
The stewards were not able to calm the situation down; police officers and cavalry officers were needed.
HJK says in its release that the players and staff of the team are shocked by what has happened.
Post-match events are not in line with the values of our traditional 111 club.
"We strongly disassociate ourselves from any conduct that endangers the safety of the matches," the release states.
The HJK promises to help authorities and event organisers clear up threats to safety and eliminate milder phenomena.
The culture of supporters is part of football and important to HJK.
We support positive, joyful and supportive action in football stands in every way.

A Philippine inventor flies with a drone car - this avoids traffic jams
Mendiola is a Philippine inventor, hip hop dancer, and some kind of Pelle Peloton.
He is now among the growing ranks of the world who swear that he has invented a flying car - or at least his own version of it.

JHL impresses: Industrial action starting tomorrow will be shown in children's day care and social and health services
In the public and welfare sectors, overtime and shift bans starting tomorrow will be particularly visible in social and health services as well as in children's day care, estimates JHL Chairman, JHL.
The impact will be extensive and will certainly be reflected in the way that there are not enough staff on the ground.
Everyone has to wonder which way to apply for their child.
It is now up to the employer to make sure that the services play and that no one's life is threatened, "says Niemi.
According to Niemi-Laine, the lack of employees was also reflected in the beginning of the year when JHL members were banned from overtime and changing shifts because of agreement negotiations.
Through flexibility, employers have made it possible for staff not to be hired, but for workers to remain in overtime or change shifts.
This is not yet an industrial action.
It is quite the norm, in terms of health and safety, for every worker to take care of regular working hours and only do them.
By taking action, JHL opposes the government's intentions to lighten the protection of small businesses against dismissal.
Markku Jalonen, labour market manager for municipal employers, will not prejudge the impact of overtime and shift bans.
But he does not believe that they are very transformative, even if services can be undermined.
Employers across Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations that can be done.
The area is so impossibly vast, a social and health service and a technical sector that hard to say.
Impacts can vary very much by industry, region and employer, Jalonen said to STT.
Jalonen says that experience was already gained last week with similar, three-day operations by the Association of Local and Primary Care Supper and the Health and Social Care Professionals Tehy.
Their effects were pretty minimal.
The JHL's overtime and shift ban applies to workers from municipalities, church, state and private social and health services, among others.
Family day carers, for example, are excluded.
Almost 100,000 JHL members are involved in the labour dispute at this stage.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL actions can last for a long time.
The alliance is also prepared for other industrial action if work on the redundancy law continues.
The government should now admit that here I run into the wall and hard.
In Jalonen’s opinion, both the trade union movement and the government must come along.
What's special about this is that the hard ones are already in a tweet, although the show has not yet been given, "Jalonen updates.

A large coral reef is created by children and adults - rays and seahorse gestures are studied in the fitness circles of the show
The Great Correctional Reef, a collective in other places, premiered in Hamburg last spring and last Saturday it was shown for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the group's previous works, the Great Correctional Reef is a work that will be built from start to finish, together with the public.
This time, however, a more clear-cut presentation will also be built, which will refresh and encapsulate the observations made in the initial exercises.
Theatre play has enough fairy-tale magic for child participants too.
The child's perspective has already been included in the preparation of the piece.
The great coral reef, however, is not a children's show, but a performance by adults and children working together.
It provides adults with information and observations about the way children receive information and make art.
The ability of children to throw themselves into exercises and shared games also makes the distance between adults and children liven.
The large coral reef resembles a fairytale ballet, fitness circuit and nature quiz to some extent, but finally it tunes around visits in different, non-human conditions.
The great coral reef begins with exploring the trajectories of corals and coral-reef organisms and fish.
Six different fitness disciplines teach the likes of rausku and seahorse gestures.
Finally, a performance lasting less than an hour, with music, lights and shiny paints and costumes to help explore the life of the coral reef.
The large coral reef is home to both diving people observing the life of the coral reef and corals being looked at.
There are also bodies that look at corals.
The eyes and observations pointed in several directions make the performance dense and life-curving.
Whether you are the landscape of an organism, the square that looks at the landscape, and the other square or landscape that looks at the organism - and all this at once.
For children, it doesn't seem difficult in any way.
In other spaces, the group, through its rehearsals, strives for a limit of thought and action to which catching up when the group is made up of both children and adults is challenging.
On the other hand, having children makes it more significant.
After the workshop, a silent demonstration for endangered corals will take place in Sitrator.
The devastation beyond human understanding should not be allowed to harden, although it could be difficult to grasp the significance of self-compassion in the face of the prospect of further destruction.

Children grow up too fast - I'm happy there were no smartphones in my childhood
Today's children and young people are becoming increasingly irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking all the time when they are younger and younger.
As far as I am concerned, children should be children throughout their childhood and not mess with their lives because of intoxicants and sex, because others say they do too.
I was embarrassed when my mate told me he had had to pick his fifth grade sister over the weekend from a "boyfriend."
When she came to pick up her drunk sister, she told of her sex experiences from that evening.
I couldn't possibly imagine my own sister in the same situation because we have been told and warned throughout our childhood that intoxicants must not be touched and sex is an adult thing.
I hope today's children would be able to live a decent childhood and would not have to grow up too early because of the group pressure created by their mates.

Yle: Authorities told State Department that Airiston Helmi is not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, interviewed by Yle, the protection police and defence forces visited to inform the defence and foreign affairs committees earlier this week.
The Finnish Government has been told that the Helme investigation of Airisto is not currently related to national security but to organised crime, reported Yle.
The information from anonymous sources was confirmed to Yle by Ilkka Kanerva (Kok), chairman of the Defence Committee.
According to Kanerva, the defence forces and the protection police visited the defence and foreign affairs committees this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is considered primarily financial crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that there was anything else, "Kanerva commented in an interview with Yle.
According to Yle's information, no evidence of a link to national security has been found so far in the seized material, but the investigation is only at the beginning.
There is nothing we can know yet about what can be revealed from there, "one of Yle's interviewees states.

Video: Dream goal saved Liverpool's losing series
Liverpool's 100 per cent Premier League start came to an end, but they were still happier with a team of 1.
On Sunday it will be exactly one year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and escaped with a 1-0 guest-victory.
That was when the Pep Guardiola combination sent a signal throughout the Premier League that City were serious now.
Everyone remembers how last season ended.
And certainly Liverpool manager Jgogren Klopp arrived in London with the same idea.
The Red had started the Premier League with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool started more strongly and Virgil van Dijk in particular seemed to be managing his own end of the field alone.
Chelsea, meanwhile, had a fine League Cup away win at Anfield Road on Wednesday.
Then Eden Hazard emerged from the interchange bench to solve the match with a magnificent individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was in from the opening minutes.
In the 25th minute, he first juggled in a small space with three-game play Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
In the end, the Croat saw Hazard sprinting forward and sent him a perfectly weighted lap pass.
Hazard drifted a bit to the edge of the penalty area but bombed a perfect left-foot drive from there into the bottom corner.
The punch's brash guard Alisson was a little slow in his fight and didn't get like his finger on the ball.
Klopp certainly felt the defeat was lightly unfair because almost immediately afterwards Antonio Rudiger bundled Mo Salah's steering from the goal line.
In the second period, also Chelsea keeper Kepa got real.
The bassoon guard reacted to Sadio Mane's pull, pushing the ball from the foot of the pole for an angle kick.
At the other end, Alisson, by throwing himself through Hazzard, netted.
The visitors' best spot came in the 72nd minute when James Milner found Bobby Firmino with his focus.
But the Brassi star's butt was directed towards national team mate David Luiz, who saved the hosts' lead.
That, too, did not last longer in the 89th minute when substitute Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot from 25 metres.
Sturridge played in his old home stadium and the attacker bombed an irresistible drive into the top corner.
Liverpool's 100 per cent league start came to an end with the 1-1 tie, but it still holds the top position - together with Manchester City.
Chelsea are also firmly in the Championship table two points behind the top.

In the debate on clocks, the tropes are deep
I remember a few decades ago a magazine asked different Finnish influences what divides the Finnish people.
Juice Leskinen's reply was left with the only thing in mind: Nen-terminal.
For some, the family name is NEN suffix and for some not.
After all, dividing lines can be born anywhere, and here was one bidder.
In the EU, Finland has achieved a move away from the annual clock movement.
Very many people agree that the transmission of clocks twice a year has been a fool's bargain and has caused a wide range of problems.
In the end, this achievement seems to be the easiest phase of the solution, at least in Finland, although it has not been easy.
The hardest thing now is to decide what time you end up with: The current summer or winter time or some other time zone.
People can also have their say on this at otakantaa.fi-page.
The inquiry was opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open until Friday 12 October.
The debate takes place hotly at coffee tables and on social media, and everyone has their say.
Winter advocates justify their position by the effect of morning light on people's well-being and summertime by the effect of the evening light on people's outdoor appetite and, by extension, well-being.
Both positions have strong supporters and good arguments.
According to research, morning light rhymes with human day and provides vibrancy.
On the other hand, if you don't particularly suffer from waking up in the dark, the light increases the movement of people outside and gives better opportunities for, for example, autumn yard work.
The amount of extra light after a normal working day has already been reduced to an hour.
Ideally I would take both, but bad for our location in the northern corner of the planet we can't fit anything.
Winters are too dark and summers too bright for many anyway.
A typical debate on the subject is that one's vision is being driven and the other's view is being very strongly opposed.
The arguments of the opposing party are hardly listened to, because the most important thing is how you feel about yourself.
Since there is an opinion from almost everyone, it is somewhat futile to try to turn the other end.
That's where the powder goes to waste.
The subject is easy to argue, since it does not require a great deal of dedication and the argument and an opinion is enough to have a mud humo-feel.
There is usually the sharpest and equally fruitless controversy over similar issues anyway.
Let's brush it up if the wrong option gets picked, but don't adapt to that either.
And it always offers a suitable scapegoat, too, if life feels ape.
I can't believe that a show-eyed Ethel with an angel's smile and the most beautiful body in the Midwest...
Josba battled through a gubernatorial victory
Josba's first gubernatorial game in the Divar at Salibandy produced a full three set points against Nurmon Jyme.
Josba left Walljoe for a home trip with a triumph 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Nurmo still led in goal at the start of the third, but Josba applied for compositions and recycled men in chains.
In time 50.47 brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi ran 6-5 winning goal.
Crucial minutes were played in a tie for second in both teams.
Josba's most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2 + 1).
The chain was firepower anyway, with Teemu Tuhkanen (1 + 1), Jere Kaartinen (1 + 0) and Jere Kettunen (1 + 0) also hitting.
Micah Kosonenkin (1 + 0) also played in the cockpit at the time of his goal.
Josba has six points after three series rounds.

At the Church of Eno 200 birthday party on Sunday
The 200th anniversary of Eno Church will be celebrated on Sunday, in part in a very sad atmosphere.
The arson of the Church of Thanksgiving Hazard a week ago was a shock.
Eno Church was also guarded in the two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still a place of celebration.
Although no one would like to, the Church of Eno is now the oldest church in the Joenmouth Parish Council.
Church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno, despite the municipal and other joints of all the world.
The family Mass begins at Eno Church today at 10am.
Then move on to the parish house to the boardroom's boardroom table.
Throughout the day, the program has all sorts inside and outside.
For example, you can explore the church building with the guidance of Ari Ramese, a retired parishioner for 37 years.
The celebration of the church's birth also marks the end of one era.
The already decommissioned parish house, built in 1982, will keep its doors open today for the last time.
We are now staying in moorland on a former town hall, says chaplain Markku Koistinen.
The parish house was devastated by indoor air problems, but the church has been standing in good health for that 200 years.

Elon Musk steps down as chairman of Tesla board - fraud charges agreed at $40 million
Electric car manufacturer Tesla and the company's CEO Elon Musk have agreed to their lawsuit with the SEC, the U.S. Securities Markets Authority.
The SEC suspected Musk of securities fraud, and Musk risked being sidelined by the company he founded.
But Musk is allowed to continue as Tesla's CEO.
Instead, Musk will have to step down from his position as chairman of Tesla's board for three years.
The company is forced to hire an external board chairman.
Musk will also face tougher scrutiny.
Under the agreement, Tesla will have to hire two independent directors and will have to further monitor Musk's communications.
In addition, Tesla and Musk will both pay $20 million (about 17 million euros) to settle the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent further market disruption and harm to Tesla shareholders," director Steven Peikin of the SEC says.
The case originated in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might withdraw the company from the stock exchange.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding has been secured.
The tweet momentarily raised Tesla's share price.
The SEC suspected Musk of securities fraud.
The agency said the tweet was false and misleading, and Musk had not talked about an arrangement with the company's other management or potential financiers.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
The SEC announced on Friday that it would challenge the company and Musk in court.
The SEC reportedly demanded that Musk be fined and banned from running any more listed companies.
The SEC's challenge saddled investors, and Tesla's stock went down strongly.

More than 800 people killed in Indonesian quake and tsunami
The number of deaths in the earthquake and subsequent tsunami in Indonesia has risen to at least 832, according to the country's disaster agency, according to news agency AFP.
The death toll is believed to be still rising as the investigation into the damage is ongoing.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure could reach thousands.
Friday's earthquake triggered a tsunami that hit the town of Palu on the island of Sulawesi.
A tsunami warning was issued immediately after the quake, but it was quickly cancelled.
According to authorities, almost all known dead are from Palu, at least for now.
Emergency officials are concerned, among other things, about the Donggala region near the epicentre of the quake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Already, several people are known to have died.
Rubble calls for help
The Indonesian military has been alerted to help rescue workers in search of victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived in the affected area today, urged soldiers to continue the rescue work without exhaustion day and night.
One of the focal points of the rescue work is the hotel in Palu, which is believed to still have 50 people in the ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the Rescue Agency, said that one people has been found alive from the ruins of Roa-Roa hotel, popular with business travellers.
We also heard calls from people for help, "he told her.
According to Syaug, heavy clearing equipment would be urgently needed for the quake and tsunami site.

Politicians' phone numbers leaked to troublemakers in Britain
Many British politicians were harassed when their contact details were leaked because of flaws in the app's encryption.
Troublemakers were able to access the phone numbers of ministers, among other things.
It was an app used at a party conference of the British Conservative Party in government.
For example, Michael Gove, the Minister for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs who is pushing for Brexit, and Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, were harassed.
Several MPs received harassment calls.
The app's lack of encryption allowed the public to access the profiles of politicians on the app, which was on the mobile app for the annual Conservative Party conference.
The public accessed the profiles using a politician's email address, which was easily accessible online.
The person entering the profile was able to view and edit material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to switch the profile picture of Boris Johnson for a while to an abusive porn picture and title.
A media mogul Rupert Murdoch was replaced as a profile picture of Michael Goven.
Dawn Foster, a columnist for The Guardian, described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows you to log into other people's profiles with their email addresses.
Then the login can view the contact details of the profile person and, say, send messages in this name.
The meeting app made every journalist, politician and participant's phone number public, Foster criticized.
A Conservative Party spokesman apologised for the information leak.
He said technical problems had been solved and the app was now operating safely.
The data leak was supported by the British Information Authority (ICO).

The Wall Finland quiz has a large crowd of clapping Poles every week
Watchful viewers drew attention to the reactions of the studio audience on The Wall Finland quiz show.
The American format The Wall has spread quickly, and its Finnish version for Nelose last Saturday.
The game show, hosted by Heikki Paasose, is filmed in the same studio in Poland, where other international productions of the format are made.
In the Polish studio, the filming possibilities were extraordinary, as the format's big 12 metre high game wall required space on the farm.
During the start up period, the studio audience of the program was raised on social media, which was teased to be Polish.
On Twitter, there was a debate about whether the Poles perhaps sitting in the studio understood anything about the game being played in Finnish.
Unne Sormunen, head of domestic programmes at Nelose, sheds light on the matter to the Evening Standard.
The studio audience, he says, includes players' close friends, other Finns, expatriates living in Poland, as well as just Polish viewers.
The audience is made up of international clappers in Finnish production, just like the audiences of The Wall episodes filmed in the same production mode in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such groups, so-called professional audiences, who go to filming different programs, Sormune's background.
He recalls that following the game itself is not so difficult, even if you don't understand the language with which it is played.
Red and green balls falling from the wall are easy to distinguish.
For foreign-language speakers, however, the studio has interpreters on hand to handle the translation work.
There are two interpreters who translate the simultaneous interpretation of what's happening to the studio moderator.
And the studio's director then instructs the audience and tells you what kind of flap is thrown out there for example and what the situation is going, "says Sormunen.
He compares the situation to how David Hasselhoff was recently engaged in domestic production.
A few years ago, David Hasselhoff was involved in filming Talent Finland with us in Finland.
He had simultaneous ear interpretation all the time and knew everything that was said in the descriptions in Finnish, the sum of Sormune.

Bread Day visitor numbers continued to rise
In the grandstand of the big hall, Pirkko Hycolor, the mother of the day, wonders the audience for the event.
Somehow you thought about it, maybe not that many people would come this year, "Hycolor reflects in the morning.
In autumn 2017, the SM competitions of Tractor Cystin were held at the same time as Bread Day, so perhaps the expectation would be that the audience might drop slightly from the previous year.
But it did not happen; the corridors were already clogging up briskly before 10, vendors reported an end to the products, more newsstands were sold for nearly 500 doses and, in the number of cars, Hycolor heard a rise.
The estimated number of visitors has been around 6,000, Hycolor says later in the afternoon.
In the five hours of the morning and afternoon, there was a particularly large programme for families with children, which would perhaps attract a record number of them.
In addition, Hycolor estimates the event will reach even further afield.
Sellers also flock to Liper every year from a larger area.
This year, nearly a hundred rapporteurs, sellers of crafts, pastries and harvest products had arrived at the breadbasket.

7 x most beautiful lamp - here you recognise a good lamp
Resurrect the space, create the right feel for the interior and read the book without making eyes tired.
You should invest in good lighting.
We gathered together three good reasons to bet on lighting.
The tips were given by Tarja Jokiniemi, director of sales and marketing at Innolux.
Do a service to your eyes
The importance of lighting increases, the more age years are behind it.
Adequate light can help with the problems many people experience with age, as vision accuracy decreases and glare suffers more and more.
As we get older, the need for light also increases.
In your sixties you need light three times more than your twenties.
So, for health reasons, it is worth investing in the healing effects of light and the characteristics of the lamp.
A good fixture gives enough light but does not dazzle, Jokiniemi tips.
Create beauty around you
The beautiful interior can only be seen with the right lighting solutions.
The decorator of the moment can afford to choose.
The favourite is an ele-free, Scandinavian and Japanese-themed japandi with a must-have style.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style drawing inspiration from the 70s has risen to bum, with its different metallic tones and icecream colours.
Authenticity fascinates in the same way as in other home decor.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Reveal Your Personality
On the other hand, more is invested in the home now than before, and the interior has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, you want a tailored, bold fixture with a story to tell your own home.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So let's be very design-aware, Jokiniemi says.
It's not necessarily the latest trend lighting that will buy the home, but a timeless classic for which many years have been saved.
Certain kinds of timeless, ornate and elegant classics hold their ground year after year, says Jokiniemi.

Gamer wants to set an example in recycling - goods go out to the world in recycling boxes, plastic changed into paper
Games specialist Pelimies now recycles packaging materials in addition to games.
The products of the customers of the stoneware store are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made from recycled material.
Products ordered from the online store are packaged in packaging from importers, for example.

Sabotage by Russian intelligence agencies has a long tradition
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation's Foreign Intelligence SVR or the military intelligence GRU have abandoned this course of action.
During the Soviet era, so-called DRG groups specialised in sabotage activities.
The name comes from the Russian words diversionno razvedyvatelnaya gruppa: Sabotage and reconnaissance group.
The Soviet security service's KGB agents in the West prepared detailed plans for important sabotage sites, says Vasili Mitrohin, archivist who defected to the West of the KGB (1922- 2004).
His information was published in Christopher Andrew’s books in 1990 at the end of the 'chapter' and 2000 in the beginning.
The sites included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, the KGB acquired DRG for groups of Bundeswehr, railways, game guards and road workers uniforms and accessories for covert operations.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: Wearing local Ukrainian police riot gear, setting up checkpoints on roads leading from the peninsula to Ukraine and isolating Crimea from its mother country.

HPK keeps Risk in its ranks for the rest of the season, Lehtinen's probation ended
Hameenlinna HPK's athletic director Mika Toivola says Filip Riska (centre) has played an important role for the team in starting, underperforming and in the defensive role of the foursome.
Filip Riska, who played in the trial period in early autumn, will continue with Hameenlinna in the final term.
The success of the experienced Riska, 33, in the roles offered to him assured the club leadership.
Filip has been an important piece for us in starting, underperforming and in the defensive role of the foursome.
While there is still room for improvement, it is good for a young team to hold on to such an experienced player, HPK athletic director Mika Toivola commented in a club announcement.
According to Toivola, the value of the risk increases when playing the hockey league's game of solutions.
Riska, a central striker from St Petersburg, has played league hockey in the past at JYP, lock and Sport.

True story on TV today: Climber was left to die twice
The American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on a man's own experiences.
Tonight's film is made on the basis of them.
Everest will now have its next night on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating snowstorm surprised climbers on Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormakur's 2015 guidance reflects a battle for survival that has been dealt with wildly.
Movies - and documentaries - about the tragedy have been made before.
The facts are also going through this story.
22 years ago, the world's tallest mountain took the lives of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced expedition leaders: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who served as the guide for the Weathers.
Mrs Weathers' life could be saved by eye surgery carried out before leaving for Nepal.
As a result of that and the air pressure, he lost his sight, making it necessary to skip the conquest of the top.
Rob Hall went on and did not return.
But the Weathers struggle for life and death had only just begun.
As the storm rose, she got lost and could no longer find her way back to the camp.
When the search for the man came, he was found in such poor condition that survival was not believed.
Weathers was left to die.
As if miraculously, however, he still got to his feet and found the others.
The badly burned Weathers were still thought to be dying and once again he was left to his own devices.
Clearly, contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, fellow climbers began to believe in the possibility to the extent that he was given help.
In the film, Beck Weathers is played by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is played by Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer by Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Without him we will be a dying flock that will not get reinforcements.
It is becoming increasingly clear, indeed, that there is a link between the incompatibility of European Union tax policies and serious unemployment.

The church of Eno, 200 years old, has been celebrated today
Eno's 200-year-old church has been celebrated today on church hill.
The church was inaugurated on October 4, 1818, and to mark the anniversary a celebration for the whole family was prepared for Sunday.
The festivities began at 10 a.m. on Eno Church Hill with a family Mass, followed by an offering from a boardroom in Eno.
The church was full.
The family Mass was attended by 517 people.
Armi Rautavuori, the vicar of Eno church, was delighted that so many people had come to the church.
It will be a great pleasure for a long time to come and give strength to work, "says Rautavuori (pictured).

Photos and videos: Medikani glimpsed his might in Greece - the sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A powerful hurricane-type autumn storm surged from southwest to Greece on Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medallion, is named Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Agency has issued a red weather warning for the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, the Ionian islands, Cyclades and Crete.
Photos taken from the area show plenty of flooding around Greece.
A video posted on Twitter shows how a river has suddenly appeared between houses in the town of Kiato in the Corinthian region instead of a street because of flooding.
Another video shows a car being driven by floodwaters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese peninsula, heavy winds caused heavy seas.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens is instructing people on its Facebook page to prepare for the storm in Greece.
The embassy advises monitoring weather reports and local authority guidelines.
A Mediterranean hurricane, or medallion, brings with it heavy rain and even a risk of flooding.
According to CNN, according to one study published in 2011, medians occur only once or two a year worldwide, typically around September-October, when sea temperatures are still high.
The storm now blowing left flooding in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey north and towards Europe.
There have also been concerns in Greece about refugee camps on islands such as Lesbos.
The thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in the camps have limited access to proper shelter.
Areas devastated by wildfires around Athens will also remain under storm in the summer.
A medic also ran rampant in Greece last November.

No going to sea now, flights still on schedule - thousands of Finns are currently holidaying on the Greek islands threatened by the autumn storm
Excursions to sea are cancelled and even when walking, care should be taken not to fly branches or other loose items over the storm.
Such instructions have been shared by guides to a good 3,500 Finns holidaying in Greece over the weekend via Solar Tours.
The advice comes as even a storm reaching hurricane levels, Zorbas golden-torm, is predicted to beat the Greek islands this weekend.
Near the island of Crete, for example, wind speeds can reach gusts up to 45 metres per second.
The weather's abject nature is enhanced by heavy rain.
Anyone who has travelled to Greece from Finland via Sun Tours and Tui and has reported their phone number has been warned of heavy winds by text message, according to tour operators.
Still in the air for sun and heat
According to solar communications expert Inka Ikonen, by early evening on Saturday the worst has been avoided in resorts.
Flights, for example, have landed and risen according to the normal schedule.
Sure, we watch all the time.
Security above you go.
I supported media dispatcher Antonia Schroderus saying their flights have also been running on schedule.
We are in constant contact with our staff at the site.
At least there was still calm in Crete, "he told the crowd in the early evening on Saturday.
The subsidies currently carry a total of good 1,500 Finnish passengers on the most popular Greek islands, Rhodes and Crete.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are holidaying in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos is expected to reach Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, the sun drenched Rhodes and the temperature reached 27 degrees, according to Ikonen of Aurinkomatkat.
Zorba is expected to become the next Turkish nuisance, albeit with some mitigation.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there to check, for example, the number of Finns flying to Antalya for subsidies, Schroderus says.

If this question is answered in a negative way, the national court must allow the execution of the European Arrest Warrant under German law, since all other conditions laid down in that legislation are also met.

Shirly Karvisella and Janni Huss totally identical evening costumes in the mission finale - this is how they react to the situation
Media personality and fitness beauties Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Finland final on Saturday in an open-backed evening dress.
Hussi says he has purchased a dress from Meslew.
I went into circulation and decided to trust the professionals who found me an absolutely gorgeous dress for this evening, "Hussi smiles.
The exact same silver evening dress was also chosen by presenter Shirly Karvinen.
The duo themselves also noticed their similar outfits and looked at the situation with a laugh.
Karvinen told Evening Standard Sanom she had become busy with preparations and was forced to board the plane.
During the mission finale, Hussi acts as a backstage and red carpet, chatting to the front row stars who arrive.
Hussi has a recent move behind him, as he moved from Kamppi to Wilderness Island on Friday
I'm going to stay there for the time being, let's see what happens.
The essential thing is that the new apartment has its own studio, Hussi pondered.
Before moving, Hussi was holidaying alone in Greece.
It was lovely, I was only in a hotel for a week without going anywhere.
As the stress unfolded, I got the flu, but otherwise the holiday was really successful, "explains Hussi.

There has been enough urgency even to the extent that Karvinen arrived at the final straight from a Finnair flight.
I makeup and put my hair on the machine.
This is the glamour.

Black overknee boots are well suited for a sumptuous outfit.
They balance the femininity of a pink, floral plier skirt with a tender, grumpy knit.
A fresh but autumn-chic everyday outfit for romantic tastes.
The strong and slightly retro-inspired outfit comes in a long copper-brown velvet dress, overknee boots, showy earrings and a staple bag.
While there is a degree of sophistication in the overknee boots, they also fit perfectly into the casual casual look together with a t-shirt, long shorts and a trendy cap.
Wonderfully easy and yet so stylish!

Two robot cars start operating in Espoo
They will operate for the rest of the year and pick up passengers, the City of Espoo informs.
Otaniemi's robotic cars will play the role of bus simulator as next spring the area is scheduled to launch traffic on a robotic bus.
The project will develop and pilot year-round robotic vehicle transport and test the technical functionality of vehicles in Finnish conditions.
The experiment will show how robotic cars fare on the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robotic bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says traffic manager Johanna Nyberg.
For the first time, robotic cars will pass completely automatically among other traffic without special traffic arrangements.
The safety of the vehicles is always the responsibility of an auxiliary passenger sitting on the ride.
The vehicles are constantly sensing their surroundings with multiple sensors and assessing whether the driveway is free.
If not, they will interpret whether a vehicle, a bicycle or a snowflake have been detected, for example, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, which is responsible for the development of robotic transport.
The robot cars will run throughout the fall on three days a week: Tuesdays at 13-15.30, Wednesdays at 10-15 and Thursdays at 10-15.
Robot cars stop at six stops along the route and take passengers aboard.
Robot car stops are identified by stop markings.

The mokoma ensemble informs about the surprising situation at the Tampere PakkaRoom gig on its website.
The gig at the mokoma band in Tampere Pakkahuone took a dramatic turn on Saturday when the band's bassist Santtu Spiderman fell off the stage in mid-performance.
The situation occurred as the band was pulling the last song of the evening.
A rotten wrist was broken.
The band will inform Facebook on their website.
"Being alive!"
Santtu stumbled on a packed room from the stage at the last song yesterday and broke his wrist.
Wishing a speedy recovery to the metal brother!
The rest of the tour gigs will be handled by the reserve crew, the website says.

Police patrol the hunt in North Karelia and Savo
The police department in Eastern Finland conducted hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday with the Forestry Commission and the Finnish game center in Northern Finland Karjala and Upper North West Side Savo, Police Department wilderness correspondents reported on social media Saturday.
The main focus of controls was on the legality and authorisation of hunting.
Each hunter was checked a hunting card and a hunting permit required on state lands.
In addition, licences for the possession of hunting weapons and permitted cartridges of self-loading weapons used in chicken farming were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were checked during the surveillance, and only one hunter was found missing the required hunting permit.
The hunter was fined 12 days for unauthorised fishing.
In addition, 133 drivers of the vehicle were blown away by police, two of whom are suspected of drink-driving.
Patrols also dealt with five traffic offences in a fine, police times.
To sum up, hunters follow the franchise of hunting very well.
Many hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
One hunter noted that "I have been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time anyone has checked the permits."
The Police Department of Finland will continue to monitor the hunt in the autumn, along with other enforcement agencies.

Mykanen heads to Turkey to monitor selection of Syrian quota refugees
Interior Minister Kai Myikkanen (Kok.) will travel to Turkey in the coming days to monitor the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
It has been decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from refugee camps in Turkey to Finland this year.
Selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year with representatives from the Immigration Department, the Department of Employment and the Economy and the police.
The delegation is already in Turkey conducting interviews.
The UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, will first select people who are particularly vulnerable.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be particularly in need in refugee camps, such as single parent families, people with disabilities and the sick, women and children.
More people are chosen for the group coming to Finland than are on the quota, because in practice some are left unarrived for different reasons.
Mr Myliken will also meet with Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu and NGOs on the border with Syria during his trip.
Ilkka Salmi, head of the Ministry of the Interior, is also on board the trip.
Talk of raising quota
Finland has been taking in quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
For a couple of years the quota was 1,050 a year, but no agreement has since emerged in the government to raise it.
The Coalition Party has been in favour of raising the quota, but the project has last fallen in opposition to the Blue Jays.
Prime Minister Juha Sipila (centre) recently called for the quota to be gradually raised to between 1,500-2,000 people a year.
The visit by Mr Mykkanen is the first by the Home Secretary in this term of government to monitor the selection of quota refugees on the ground.
Previous interior ministers Petteri Orpo (Kok.) and Paula Risikko (Kok.) had time to move on to their new duties before the visits were arranged.
Finland receives EUR 10 000 from the EU for each refugee in a particularly vulnerable position.

Now let's go wrong - no longer know whether to cry or laugh
Last Saturday, Karjalainen announced a bill to amend the Animal Protection Act.
The article gave the impression that the bill, as a matter of principle, prohibits, as farm animals, pets or otherwise business-related, the keeping of all animals that are not specifically permitted by ministerial regulations.
Everything else is therefore, by definition, prohibited except for animals specifically mentioned in the regulation.
If the bill ends up in law, it should mean that we are abandoning the general principle in Western democracies that the law explicitly prohibits activities that endanger the security or good practice of society.
A ban on all activities not specifically authorised by law or regulation is now in the process of being enacted, in principle.
The change will mean that nothing new can be tried in business, for example, and nothing else done until the law or regulation approving it has been passed.
The government's performance in law making in general has been poor.
If you now go down the road of basically banning everything in Finland that is not specifically allowed, you no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I have no doubt that the Animal Protection Act will require an update.
But a legislative project along these lines is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I am not very familiar with the Constitution, but I wonder whether it will accept such a 'everything is forbidden, not specifically permitted by law or regulation' procedure.
Hopefully there will be some sensible minister who will interrupt the progress of such a legislative project.

Metti Forssell tips: The four trendiest skirts of autumn
This autumn's trend garment comes in snake blossoms.
It looks especially good in skirts.

Kimi Raikkonen summed up the reason for Mercedes' superiority over Ferrari
Ferrari’s Kimi Raikkonen was allowed to admit that the worst rival Mercedes was too tough a piece of Russian GPS time at fan time.
But there is no reason to panic in the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver estimated.
They just were faster than us, but there's no huge issue.
So far our car was pretty in time the whole weekend, but they just were too fast, fourth racer and garage mate Sebastian Vettel with Mercedes fwd pace clearly missed Raikkonen said.
It was difficult for Ferrari already in the last race in Singapore.
Raikkonen was asked what caused the sudden fall from the Mercedes.
They seem to go faster than us - that's how simple it is.
If I knew the reason for that, we'd probably go at the same speed as they did.
However, I do not know anymore than anyone else.
This is constant guesswork, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
A rare treat was seen on time for Raikkonen's future stable Sauber.
The replacement for Raikkonen at Ferrari next season, Charles Leclerc, was seventh, with Marcus Ericsson also crossing for the final time of the adjudication.
For the Swedish striker, his 10th start is the best in more than three years.
And while in the second driving session no fewer than five drivers left driving altogether, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging for Raikkonen for the future?
Yes, if you compare where they were in the early part of the season, then the step forward has been big.

It was there - Erkan Teper was knocked out by Robert Helenius: "Robbe is back"
The match between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper on the evening in Stuttgart went ahead in even conditions.
The German was the more proactive side in the ring, but he did not get a decent hit.
A clearly more extended Helenius controlled the match with its tough sets, which found well where it was.
The Finn was also clearly in better physical condition than the Taper.
The solution finally came in the eighth round when Teper was knocked out by Helenius on his left straight.
The hit was so hard that the dagger, who was in front of the home crowd, didn't even try to get up from the mat.
After the victory was secured, Helenius winded quite moderately.
In the ring interview, he initially praised the good atmosphere created by the audience and his opponent.
Then, for a moment, he switched his tongue to Finnish.
Thank you to all viewers and Finnish cheers.

Helenius rejoiced immediately after the match.

According to The Guardian magazine, the country's vice president calls for a clear rise in the number of victims.
According to the country's vice president, Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims could reach thousands.

Rescuers are searching for those trapped, as well as dead, in the hardest-hit areas of Sulawesi island: The port city of Palu and neighbouring Donggala.
So far, all the victims are from Palu, the situation in Donggala is not yet clear.
Hundreds of people are missing and around 540 have been badly injured.
There are still people in collapsed buildings that rescuers have been unable to get out.
For example, hotel Roa Roa Roa Ac in Palu has collapsed.
Rescuers report hearing the cries of people trapped in the rubble, but the lack of clearing equipment has delayed the start of rescue work.

The question to Anttikoski was customs via Facebook.
User Pirkko Ella wanted to know the latest book the mission finalist has read.
Mr Anttikoski thought of his answer with a good second before beginning with hesitation.
Thank you for the question, Pirkko Ella.
The latest book I've read is..., "Anttikoski said, thinking.
The pause for reflection sparked a roar of laughter in the audience until Mr Anttikoski continued his response:
The last book I've read is...
I do read books at school!
Probably something related to economics.
So the last book I've read is economics someone, "Anttikoski replied.
After his response, Mr Anttikoski received resounding applause from the audience, with laughter.

Line the bread pan with baking paper, scatter 2 tablespoons of sugar over the bottom of the pan and spread the pear slices over the sugar.
Spoon half the batter over the pear slices and the apple blocks over the dough.
Spoon the remaining batter over the apple slices.
Cook in an oven in 180 C for about an hour, until the surface is beautiful brown.
Allow to cool in the pan, then set aside for the serving dish.
Cut the cake until cooled properly.
The cake is brittle in design and crumbles easily because the dough has almond and corn flour without gluten.

Status symbols do not attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney analysed the issue, and outlined two types of "coolness" with slightly different characteristics: generally attractive coolness and the partially opposite dissident to it.
Charmingly, the coolers had many socially desirable traits, according to the researchers' description: Out-oriented, friendly, match-fit and competent.
The dissidents, on the other hand, were characterised by distance, independence, insurgency and crack.
They craved for experience and paid little heed to the outsiders' evaluations.
Both types were associated with good self-esteem and a steady feeling for the life.
For the longer term, the role of covis is not cool: high status at the age of teenage does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is what the 2014 American study published in the Child Development journal.
Young people who socialized early, billowed, sought out good-looking bargains and tended to favor others had an increased risk of substance abuse and delinquency as young adults.
In their relationships, they fared less well than their once more discreet peers.
High status is signalled by luxury cars, designer bags or watches that don't make a person a cool - or at least a genuinely attractive follower.
In a study published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, the vast majority of people were more prepared to befriend a regular market shirt than those dressed in a designer shirt - despite the fact that most people chose to wear a designer shirt during a visit.

The storm is extremely powerful, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens will report it on its Facebook page.
According to the embassy, the Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red weather warning for the areas.
The impending storm is also reported in the blog Foreca, a weather service.
It said the storm's toughest gusts are up to 45 metres per second.
By comparison, the Kuisma storm that beat Finland early in the week blew a good 31 meters per second.
According to the blog, however, the main concern of the storm is not wind, but heavy rain.
Over the weekend, more than 300 millimetres of water may be coming from the South Saint Greece.
That equates to about half of Finland's annual rainfall.
Weather service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video of the storm developing on its Facebook page.

Valtteri Bottas shakes and burst the adrenaline in Sochi - will he find himself Hamilton's helper on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas shuddered a little further for dozens of minutes after he stood in front of the media.
The fine lap left Mercedes number one star Lewis Hamilton behind and was mentally certainly an important criticism for the Finn driver who collected the title this season.
A nice lap.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left the settlement round.
It feels good, I'm shaking a bit even, "Bottas clarified.
I have only been on pole once this year, in Austria (midsummer), so time has passed quite a bit.
This track has been good for me in the past and I got good laps again.
It's not easy to skip at the Sochi track, so the start is especially big.
And of course Bottas was given the answer to the thumbs up whether he will be driving to victory tomorrow or whether the jeering of Hamilton approaching the World Cup title.
My starting point for the race is definitely trying to win.
You can't have another goal when you leave the pole, Bottas trounced.
But as a stable we fight for both championships.
Lewis's lead over Sebastian Vettel is pretty big and the difference with me is very big, so keep it in mind.
Let's see what happens, however, Bottas perfected.
Hamilton was genuinely delighted with Bottas's success after the drive, and Mercedes stable boss Toto Wolff was also seen with a taste.
Lewis had the intention to beat Valtteri, but he did not manage a standing bend.
Valtteri knows he has to rip everything out of himself to beat Lewis.
And he was so charged that the adrenaline burst out of his ears, "Wolff gushed.
To the question of whether the stable allowed Bottas and Hamilton to run rashly, Wolff replied, dodging.

Crystallized Erno Kinnunen reached rally for Finnish championship
Rally racing's SM series ended unusually.
Hardly ever before have the brothers ended up as champions of Finland at the same time.
Now it was done at the closing rally around Turku and Salo by the Tuusulans Eerik and Henrik Pietarinen, as Eerik won the category SM-1 and Henrik SM2.
Crystalline player Erno Kinnunen ensured the best achievement of his career, as the third place in the closing race sealed him the Finnish championship in the two-drive car from SM4.
Kinnunen and co-driver Ville Makela, who competed on Honda Civic, started in Turku with composure because the starting points were clear: A placement in the top group would guarantee the SM title.

Syria demands US, France and Turkey withdraw troops
The Syrian foreign minister is demanding that the US, France and Turkey withdraw their troops from Syria.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem says foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.

Not quite the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court judge drama on TV
Brett Kavanaugh, the judge nominated for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the professor who accused him of harassment, had an extraordinary number of people around the screens.
The drama of the nomination of a Supreme Court judge running at full speed in the United States drew at least 20 million people to its televisions on Thursday.
At the time, Kavanaugh, who was nominated by Donald Trump and Blasey Ford, a Californian professor who accused him of harassment, were before the Senate Judiciary Committee to tell his story.
Preliminary results show that the hearings were followed by six main channels, namely ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC, with a total of 20.4 million viewers.
They were joined by several million more online consultations.
NBC reported that 6.8 million people watched the live stream and CNN reported that it had made its record for the year with 8.2 million live broadcast starts.
CNN's figure rises to more than 10 million, including those who watched the broadcast via YouTube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also reached 8.0 million starters.
Digital startups are the channels' own, TV viewer figures are from R & D analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen will release the final readings on Monday, but they will be soaring anyway.
Few reach 20 million
Audiences of more than 20 million in the United States typically reach only sports matches, as well as the entertainment world's major Oscars and Grammy gala and occasional political events such as presidential speeches and presidential debates in 2016.
Sure, there is a way to go for the American Football League's annual most-watched program, the NFL final match of the Super Bowl.
This year, the Super Bowl attracted around 103 million people to the NBC channel.
Last year, Trump's first speech to Congress was viewed by nearly 48 million people in total and good 30 million people at the inauguration, according to Nielsen.
An issue of top importance
The Supreme Court's nomination of judges is an extremely significant case in the US, as the posts are lifelong.
Trump already got to appoint one new judge when Antonin Scalia passed away in early 2016 and Republicans managed to prevent then-President Barack Obama from appointing a successor to him.
Another seat was opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement this year.
Kennedy was nominated by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but on a number of issues he was a so-called "scales" whose voice could resolve the nine-person court position.
He was a supporter of the right to abortion and the rights of sexual minorities, and in 2015, for example, he resolved with his vote that same-sex marriage was a "# justice" across the federation.
Kavanaugh is far more conservative in his positions.
His election to the Supreme Court may lock in the Conservative supremacy of justice for decades.

Children have the right to have their information passed to parents
Only parents of children under the age of 10 can see the health information of their children from the Kanta service.

In the US, the FBI began pursuing harassment allegations against Kavanaugh
According to US media, the FBI is investigating allegations of harassment by at least two women.
Another of the women appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this week.

Us President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The investigation must not take longer than a week.
According to the Washington Post, this is a more limited investigation of the crime and may not become public.

Aid agencies prepare to start work on Indonesia's Sulawesi - "Clean water is the most urgent"
United Nations Children’s organisation UNICEF and other international aid organisations are prepared to help at Indonesian island of Sulawesi, says Kirsi Haru, Chief of UNICEF Finland.
Local authorities are leading the rescue effort, but the need for further assistance is already apparent at this stage.
UNICEF operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programs in Indonesia.
Along with normal operations, UNICEF always has full emergency response capability, says Haru.
The first task now is to find people in the rubble, both the survivors and the dead.
In the town of Palu, Sulawesi, rescue operations are underway, but in the Donggala region, a little further north, the situation is less clear.
There are still places where connections do not work.
Relief efforts are difficult because roads are also cut off, says Haru.
Buildings in Sulawesi are often lightweight, so the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami is great.
Once the survivors are found, they need shelter - first, for example, tents - and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
First, people are most often able to provide water purification tablets that UNICEF also has in store.
Efforts are being made to repair the water systems as soon as possible, but in the event of an emergency, water will be transported first, for example by trucks.
In crisis situations, many children are separated from their parents.
The search for family members and family reunification is one part of UNICEF's remit.
Food help, on the other hand, is organised by the World Food Programme (WFP), which is part of the UN.

But UNICEF, among others, has already started fundraising to help victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami.

Billionaire Elon Musk quits as chairman of Tesla board - $20 million fine for tweets
Elon Musk, founder of space rocket and electric car companies, avoids fraud charges in a deal with the U.S. Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk will quit his role as chairman of the board of electric car company Tesla and agree to a $20 million fine.
Musk will step down from the role as part of a deal he struck with the U.S. Securities Markets Authority.
By agreeing to avoid fraud charges, Musk.
The U.S. Securities Commission SEC threatened Musk with securities fraud over his tweets in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing to withdraw the electric car company Tesla from the stock exchange, prompting a rapid rise in the company's share price.
Under the agreement, Musk will not be allowed to chair Tesla's board for three years.
In addition, Tesla must nominate a new "independent member" to its board and take on two "independent directors" to its management team.
Tesla also needs to establish a committee to monitor Musk's communications.
Musk is still allowed to continue as Tesla CEO.
In addition to Musk's personal $20 million fine, Tesla company also has to pay an equivalent 20 million fine to the financial controller.
Tweets misled investors
According to the SEC, Musk's tweets misled investors and Tesla shareholders.
Musk claimed he would have secured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange into a private limited company.
According to the billionaire's tweets, the company would have been bought out off the stock exchange at a share price of $420.
After tweets, Tesla's stock price rose more than ten per cent after tweets a day, but fell later.
According to the SEC, Musk's allegations had no basis in any way.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated the funding he claimed to have.
Nor had he discussed withdrawing from the stock exchange with the rest of the management team or the company board.
On Friday of this week, the rate decreased 14 percent when the SEC, the securities supervisor, announced a fraud charge.
The news agreement is expected to strengthen the company's course again.
