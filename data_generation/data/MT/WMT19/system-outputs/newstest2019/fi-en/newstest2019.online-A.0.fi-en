Korean leaders or a Congolese gynecologist?
As the winner of the American President Donald Trump's Nobel Peace Prize, the idea may sound strange, but Trump is one of the biggest favourites in the award of betting odds.
The background is the role of the trumpet in getting North Korea at least at the level of rhetoric to commit to nuclear disarmament.
On the basis of the coefficients, the biggest favourites for the Nobel Prize for Peace are the South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korea's leader Kim Jong-Un who have met three times this year and promised to seek a peace agreement between their countries.
The warming of the Korean spaces is remarkable, as last year there were good gaps.
Yet, for years, the compensation of Kim, who was threatened by nuclear weapons and his country with an iron grip, would undoubtedly raise criticism.
The winners of the Nobel prizes will be announced from Monday onwards, and on Friday the highest priority is the peace Prize.
If the prize is not given to participants in the Korean Peninsula, the Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege is one of the top candidates.
The esteemed gynecologist has treated thousands of women who have been victims of rape in the DRC in the Democratic Republic of Congo and emerged as the leading expert in the world.
Mukwege's work has drawn attention to sexual violence, which is a gruesome by-product of many conflicts.
The Un refugee organisation, which won the Nobel Peace Prize between 1954 and 1981, was also a strong candidate.
The Nobel committee has been told that this year the prize will be 331 candidates.
The names of the candidates are not disclosed.
Trump himself would not mind if the Nobel laureate could.
In May, the journalist asked him about the White House to earn the peace Prize.
Everyone thinks, but personally I'd never say it, Trump said with a smile.
I want to get this done.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, the President continued with reference to the North Korea talks.
There are, however, factors that make the trumpet a Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee for the award of the prize has often acknowledged individuals and organisations representing a liberal democracy and a multipolar world order-just the kind of international cooperation that Trump has Seen.
In the 2000 century the prize has been awarded to three American politicians, all of whom have been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
Rewarding the trumpet would therefore require an ideological turnaround for the Nobel committee.

Fire alert in tunnel: Motorists behaved like lemmings and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos that occurred on the first road in Lohja occurred on 8 September. September.
Traffic in the tunnel area was disconnected in the direction of both Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that it was a system malfunction, the fire department attempted to bring the traffic to normal.
However, it did not succeed very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the road traffic center said that it could not be opened, because there are motorists on the road and they drive how it hurts, on duty the fire master Pasi Käkäinen told the Stis at the time.
The motorway was then driven up in the wrong direction only after a moment of waiting.
When the first starts to work against the traffic rules, a few others often follow suit, with the traffic safety contact Manager Tapio Heiskanen amazed.
According to the traffic rules, motorways and tunnels must not be allowed to stop as a compelling reason.
Road safety reminds us that in exceptional circumstances it is not possible to start endangering traffic by hasty solutions.
Emergency vehicles must always be given the most unobstructed passage possible.
Driving in the opposite direction on a motorway is especially forbidden, as is the U-turn and cancellation.
The same bans are also in place in tunnels, where there is always a need to turn on the headlights.
Also, stopping without compelling reason is forbidden, as of course also parking.
Recently, there have even been cases where the driver stopped in a tunnel to brush up on his Lumia car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for that activity, Heiskanen says in the Traffic safety bulletin.

Ilves fans would have liked to continue their celebrations even though the ship was caught on the bottom of the lake
On the inland waterway M/S, the Ilves fans, which were transported by the Tampere Department, would have liked to be on board to continue to celebrate, even though the ship had been left at the bottom of the lake, says Juho Syrjä, who was the ship manager at the time of the event.
On the way from Hämeenlinna Tampere, M/S Tampere went out late on a Saturday night out of his route and remained at the bottom of the bow with Vanajavesi in Akassa.
The ship had been aboard 19 passengers and five crew members were evacuated at night to the mainland.
No one was offended by the Haverin.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their celebrations on board until dawn, but of course it was more sensible to send them to the fire department by the Port and bus home, the remote said to the Stis.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna for the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended with the 4-3 victory of Ilveksen.
According to the discrimination, Saturday's haveri was due to the fact that the water level in Vanjavavesi was about half a metre lower than normal.
It was also hampered by the fact that the closest bus sign was covered by a log, which is why its reflectors did not appear normally in the dark in the blame.
No MAINITTAVAMPAA collision
Haveri took place on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalmi, shortly after the boat route was under the bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
The greater drama was not associated with the case, as the pace of the ship was very low at the time of the event and no MAINITTAVAMPAA impact was caused by hitting the bottom.
According to the discrimination, the bottom failure has not caused any leakage or pressure on the ship, and the boat cruises will continue normally.
On Saturday morning, the diver went on to inspect the ship's condition before the ship began to tow off the low.
As a precaution, we are still in the dock to check that this is not the result of any damage.
The remote believes that M/S Tampere Next, at the end of next week, a barted cruise can be handled by the atonement.
The vessel's cruise season continues according to his Independence Day.
No use for ambulances
The rescue service received an alert on the incident on Saturday night a little half after twelve.

In the event of harassment and the accused, the trumpet judge candidate may be missing out on top posts
Brett Kavanaugh, who is the judge of the Supreme Court of the United States, may well be missing out on the posts, evaluating Program director Mika Aaltola in Foreign Policy Institute.
To date, at least three women have accused Kavannauh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour during the study.
According to Aalola, doubts have brought so much political pressure to the Republican Party that President Donald Trump could end up with another person in office.
In the past, the United States has occasionally seen the presidential candidate as the judge of the Supreme Court having aroused a great deal of controversy.
In this case the candidate for the judge is usually withdrawn, says Aaltola.
This is how the president has been able to maintain his face.
Name of the port to Democrats in the Laar
The Supreme Court of the United States strives to be above the policy, but, at least in the case of Kavannagu, the election of a new judge has become a politically delicate process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision to be taken by the Aaltolola is likely to be a Democrat in the Laar Congress in the forthcoming interim elections.
It would increase the enthusiasm for the vote among young people and women who are more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-standing victory for Republicans.
The occasion for the appointment does not hit every presidency, as the judges of the Supreme Court are appointed to life.
In practice, some of them have opted out of their own request for retirement at about 70-80 years of age.
A part of the Republican hesitate to refer to the
The United States Supreme Court judge candidates are also subject to a normal background report, Altola states.
Although Trump only ordered a one-week period for an additional explanation of the Fla, it can still bring something essential.
Yes it may bring.
Rarely is smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltolan, it is certain, at least, that the suitability or impropriety of kavaunaugh'n will be debated even more heavily before the Senate takes its decision.
In the Senate, the Republicans have a majority of 51-49 votes, but at least two female Republican senators are thought to be sceptical about Mr Kavnaughton's name.
The most embarrassing thing would be for the nomination to be exported to the vote and for the Republicans to disappear.

The woman identified the suspect as a military intelligence agent
A Russian woman has told the BBC broadcaster that she recognizes Salisbury poisoning as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service of a suspected Russian man.
On the basis of the photographs, the woman was told that she was Anatoly Tthepiga, who works in military intelligence in the Grui.
Online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia reported earlier that it had revealed another poisoning from suspected men to be a tthepiga.
In the past, they said they had found evidence that the current identities of men are covert identities.
The BBC group traveled to the Far east near the Russian-Chinese border, where Tshiiga grew up.
The woman living in the village recognized the young Tshigiga in the pictures published by Bellingcatin.
He recognized the same man in the British police's pictures, which featured a man who is now inviting Ruslan to Bosnia.
Russian men are suspected of being the former twin agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter poisoning Novitshok-nerve myryes in March.
Skalpalit survived.
Colonel Tthepiga has been awarded the honour of the Russian hero, among others, in 2014.
Russia is still denying a suspected GRU connection.
In September, the suspected poisoning men reported that they had in Salisbury as tourists in their interview with Russian TV.

Elderly throwing bags in the Sote reform
There is now a vivid example of what the change of the Sote reform limiter, as defined by the Sipilä Government, means in practice.
In my birthplace, the Vaala Sote services are produced by the municipality of Oulu, which is the former regional director of Attendon, elected as health service director in 2016.
The group leaders warn the board of the change limiter.
If the sote expenditure now rises, the municipal state aid will be cut in the future.
The city centre makers were scared, and most of them are ready for a major restructuring of the elderly, which would end the health Centre's Department of Institutional care and small memory units.
There would be an increase in home care, which means, in the light of long distances, that elderly people living in remote villages are ripped from their roots to be treated by the health centre ' at home '.
Attendo trusted the municipality to pay the customers.
The left wing of the Vaala did not have a bad preparation, but organised a good audience opportunity, which became a lot of relatives, close carers and also delegates of other parties.
I presented the Sote provincial preparation with slides to see how the elderly in the municipality are already the largest in the whole of Northern Ostrobothnia.
There was also a neighboring councillor, Carina Western.
The local newspaper made a big story about the event, and it again brought the Oulu draftsmen back to their feet.
The Sote draftsmen do not write in any paper that Attendo has built a new nursing home, which now awaits the empty inhabitants.
There are no other service providers.
The draftsmen speak only of the voucher, but do not tell us what level of treatment it can receive or the type of staff the Attendo will take to treat elderly people until hospice.
Without a nurse?
In fact, the sites of the health centre are discontinued because there is no medical night-time emergency.
Attendo should also be resorted to doctors in the Vaala health centre.
The example of Vaala illustrates how centring officers run delegates with incomplete information, and delegates are injected against the wall with a change limiter.
In this way, the Centre Party clears the inhabitants of the Vaala, for whoever is left to live voluntarily if there is an opportunity to move away.

Turkish President Erdogan opened a grand Mosque in Cologne
In the city of Cologne in Germany, thousands of people showed their protest when the country visiting Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, opened Europe's largest mosque.
Several hundred people had gathered around the river Rhine in the morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read the demonstrators ' signs, and the slogans condemned fascism.
A number of demonstrations have taken place during the visit to Erdoğan on Thursday, and the security measures have been tight.
Around 10 000 people were expected to protest in the streets of Cologne in advance, including the human rights situation in Turkey.
In the vicinity of the Grand Mosque, the supporters of Erdoğan had also gathered.
However, the police had isolated a large area of the mosque from the environment for safety reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised his visit to Germany for having been successful in evaluating the relations between Germany and Turkey.
During her visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel vowed on Friday to rebuild their relations, which have deteriorated significantly since Turkey's 2016 coup attempt.
However, Merkel emphasised that there are deep differences between countries on issues such as human rights.
Review surrounds your visit
Both Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker and Prime Minister Armin Laschet of the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia withdrew their attendance at the inauguration when the review of Erdoğan accelerated.
A 30-year-old student from Turkey, Cansu, said that he had come to the protest against Erdoğan in Switzerland.
I want to have a voice for those who can not leave the streets in Turkey.

In Slovakia, three people have been prosecuted for the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.

Earlier this week, the police arrested eight people in investigating the murder, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was discovered in February, fired with his fiancé from his home in Bratislava.
He had studied the relations between politicians and the Italian mafia.

Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
The journalist Arto Nyberg is today to interview, for example, Vesa Heilalaa, in his live discussion programme.
Vesa is in the studio telling about his upcoming space trip, which he drafted from Virgin Galactica already in 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000, which needed a bank loan.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a while ago.
However, the departure date has been postponed for a year.
Now it seems that, after the misfortune of the unfortunate test, which occurred in 2014, and after the deaths of the dead, things are in the hole.
If all goes well, commercial flights will start this year or no later than next year.
Vesan flight number is 300, which means that his journey is about a year away from the first departure.

Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Rahunti and amazed Ferrari: "Losing a very important driver"
In an interview with the Swiss magazine Blick, Mersu's British driver was asked, does he, that the release of Kimi Rauskösen from Ferrari services would help Hamilton in the rest of the season.
Hamilton leads the second driver of Ferrari in the World Cup with 40 points.
Just under three weeks ago, Ferrari reported that Raikkonen would not continue in the garage next season and Raikkonen announced his move to Sauber.
Of course, Hamilton doesn't think that Raikkonen would loose gloves in the counter.
I don't think Kimi will change in the remaining races.

A-Young Football Championship in the SM-liiga became A full farce: The opponent came to the scene with only 7 players
Football boys ' highest league level ends on Saturday, when the last round of the season is played.
The starting points for the championship battle before 13 p.m. were clear: FC Lahti Academy is enough to be ranked first in practice against the Vasa IFK.
In order to turn the situation into a final round, the second, in the championship battle, will have to win the SME 35 and the desirable lahtelaisten loss.
The Lahtelaisten Championship was, however, confirmed in practice even before the start whistle, as the Vasa IFK had arrived at Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one less of the Vaasas, the match could not have been started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
The break in Lahtelaiset led 7-0.
One reason for the dealer's play is that the team has played A part in the same players as the A-young SM-series, the P20 series, and the men's Kakkonen C-blocks.

Serena Williams startle on video, where she sings topless-campaigning for breast cancer awareness
Tennis superstar Serena Williams to lose weight again.
He now campaigned to raise awareness of breast cancer by publishing a video of his Instagram account, in which he sings only his hands in front of his breasts, says the news agency AFP.
The song is the hit I Touch Myself in The 1991 by Australian The Divinylers.
In video Williams supports Australian Breast Cancer Association activities.
"I recorded The Divinylsi global hit to remind women to regularly perform self-service [breast] checks," Williams writes in his Instagram message.

The second writer of The Divinysin song is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which was made in honour of Chrissy Amphitt.
"He died of breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to give priority to their health," Williams says.
The video has now been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was released early on Sunday morning.
In the video's comments, Williams is praised for his courage.

Flu season is hot.
Many people are going to stay home or not.
However, it is worthwhile to consider whether others are going to infect the disease, because the diseases can be contagious even if their own symptoms are small.
Between the flu symptoms strike suddenly, between them appearing in the yeast.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your symptoms feel small, says Prevention release.
Is it worth staying at home?
According to Prevthion, the flu is contagious even when the person itself has no symptoms.
The Virus is transmitted already a day before the symptoms start and from then on from five days to a week.
Children may infect the disease longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you should not be at school or at work.
The work can return when the cough is relaxed and no fever is any more, says Professor Gregory Poland.
You should also avoid training.
Too fast the return to the gym slows recovery.

If you have to leave your home ill, consider using a protective mask.

Then the fingers will not be placed in the nose or mouth, Poland says.
The sneezing is also limited to the mask.
How can we escape the infection?
The best way is still washing your hands and avoiding touching your face.
However, it is difficult to escape the latter.
In the United States, for example, the average person touches his eyes, nose or mouth every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.

EX managers require Robert Helenius to pay outstanding fees
The evening game of boxer Robert Helenius against Erkan Teinherit is a shadow of a monetary dispute.
The evening messages were today reported by the boxing manager Jaakko Heluto and the deputy Judge Jussi Kokkala for the challenge of the application, in which a total of over 80 000 euro was paid by the Helenius with interest on arrears.
According to the application for the challenge, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius 15.4.2014-30.1.2015.
We have tried to reconcile, but there is no other alternative.
There has been a definite mandate, and a great deal of work has been done, says Kokkila to the evening messages.
The current manager of Helenius, Markus Sundman, sent a statement to the evening newspaper describing the events of the boxer's vision.
Helenius denies that it is required to pay the amount required.
According to the match, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services in a financially awkward situation for Helenius and promised to be able to organize matches and sponsor income.
It was understood that Helenius was obliged to pay only percentages of his matches.
It was repeatedly assured that Helenius would not need anything to pay, just to receive the income they have organized.
This is also the normal and only practice of the professional athletes ' manager in action.
There has never been an agreement on paid work and it would have been absurd in the context of the Helenius situation, Sundman explains in a message he has produced.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
According to the match, Helenius had wanted to agree on the income distribution in writing from the outset, but Kokkila and Sundman did not make a draft until the end of 2014.
He said that the proposal was a poor person and that he broke the cooperation with Kokkala and Helide.
Helenius did not once in dealings with Kokkala and Helide.
One year after the end of cooperation, Helenius had been assigned a "unique but extensive" invoice manager's work.
This year, the same arguments have been brought.
Helenius keeps a few things in a cowardly, in a reply.

Russian Dimitri father and Ingerese Svetlana-mother believed her daughter's success in Miss Finland final.
A fresh Miss Finland Alina Voronkova's parents, Dimitri Voronkov, and Svetlana Voronova were proud to be the first moments in the crown.
They were a fairy-tales audience from Pertunmaa and were going to drive back home again.
Have a wonderful atmosphere!
We believed the whole time, but half an hour before the result began to stretch, Svetlana chuckled.
Svetlana is an Inkerese and Dimitri Russian.
Alina was fluent in Russia, although it has lived throughout his childhood in Finland.
Svetlana says that Alina was a little more interested in acting and many other things than the career of Missi.
It was often said to Aliny that when he was so pretty, it should begin to be a miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio presenter.
Only later Alina was inspired by beauty contests.
The parents ' wish was that Alina would get to the university before he would participate in the Miss Finland contest.
I saw this, and finally Alina wanted to make a Kandi degree before the Missi races.
We were asking last year why he was not attending, but he wanted to make it to the Kandi ready.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because it is a healthy example for teenagers and adults alike.
She plays a lot and eats healthily.
And Alina likes to be featured, it shows.
Alina's boyfriend Joonas Hurri is a hockey player for his work in Japan, and did not get to Finland to cheer for his beloved finale.
The parents of Alina believe that the relationship between young people lasts for a year.
Yes so is the purpose!
The parents hoped that the daughter would soon have to visit.
There has been such a long break in visits due to the haste of the Missi.
It is already tedious, although there have been messages.

Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland-I think the idea of a comic-art shortage did not slow down
The organic shovel once went out of my husband's uttermost, where he suggested the story I developed, says the Espoo comic blogger, housewife and former EU translator Sari Piippo.
Sari Piippo says that she was a member of the European Economic and Legal Affairs Committee in Brussels until after the fourth child became a returnees ten years ago.
I have enjoyed my home mother very well.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it came to mind that what it would do when the slightest kid started to be big.
Then the 2014 picture became a cartoon.
Piippo tells us that he never dreamed of making a comic, even though he had read Donald Duck, Tintin and Asterix from the outset.
I had drawn the last time as a child, but when these organic waffle manuscripts began to emerge, the situation changed.
I made the next top some dozens of screenplays in the drawer.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (born 2000) is an accomplished designer, but I didn't get him to be tempted before the summer of 2016 when I donated the drawing board.
His enthusiasm lasted for a dozen strips, and then I was forced to start trying himself, laughing at the Piippo, who says the drawing board was a big incentive for him.
A drawing board is an easy and convenient tool to try and get something done.
I have not even tried to draw a paper, says Piippo in his relationship to drawing, which he usually does in the evenings.
The manuscripts popers to mind constantly, but I usually don't make it ready at once.
It takes up to several hours to get to one three-screen strip.
I might make a screen at a time and play with the colors.
Starting drawing is always the hardest thing to do, because drawing is not the strongest of my species.
Sari Piippo tells about her appreciation of contemporary newspaper comics, including Scott Adams ' Dilberis.
The Organic Shack is the "L"-themed mother of the carrot-and-stick-hair-Pehko.
Other persons are male, Fjortis and twins.
In the organic world, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from their own life and social media.
Ricky P do not want to preach or to offer the forced buns even if the organic shack is in the case.
Piippo says that she is reading her husband and children.
After all, it's such a great feeling when you look at the comic and find out that this is what I've done today.
And the challenges are enough for a housewife!

Earthquake in Indonesia: The air traffic controller sacrificed himself-not left a cracking tower before he got hundreds of passengers to safety
The Indonesian earthquake's hero has risen to 21-year-old air traffic director Anthonius Gunawan Agung.
Agung was left alone in the air traffic control tower until hundreds of people were allowed to transport the passenger plane safely from the earthquake-ravaged island.
In the city of Palu, the youngster was the air traffic control at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie, when the earthquake struck on Friday.
On the other flight from the air traffic control tower, Agung refused to leave the place before he was directed to the air from the runway of the Batik air aircraft.
In so doing, he could save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian Civil Aviation Administration told AFFP.

Rehn wondered about the luxury of ending Europe in a trade war: "Keep watch the next tweet"
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the global economy.
Growth forecasts have been calculated throughout Europe and the Finnish bank has also slightly lowered its own economic growth estimates.
Mr Olli Rehn, the Director-General of the executive, said in the first, that even if the tension is not directly affected by the European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which in turn reflects the investment decisions of companies.
The situation also applies to the export of Finnish companies.
In the opinion of Mr Rehn, Europe is very much at the moment.
It has succeeded in building an interpeace with the United States and has also helped to calm the situation with China and Japan.
In the opinion of Mr Rehn, Europe does not seem to be crushing the trade war.
Keep Watch the next tweet and evaluate it afterwards.
We have a time for an unforeseen partner in Washington, but he said in an interview with YLE.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is the third largest national economy in the euro area, Italy, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro zone and throughout the Western world.
The market reacted sharply yesterday to the Italian government on Thursday evening to clearly present the deficit budget.
Next year's deficit is over 2.4% of national product.
Mr Rehn sees the situation in Italy as worrying.
Five per cent of the country's lending is a problem of credit and there are more than 10% of marshland loans.
In addition, its public finances are in poor straits and the country seems to have regained its commitment in relation to its European partners.
It may not be a good idea to paint new crises yet, Mr Rehn replied when asked whether Italy would be taking the new economic crisis in Europe.
Another thing that affects Europe is Britain's resignation from the Eu.
Rehn hoped that it would be in harmony.
There would be much more negative effects on the dispute.
Rehn started as president of Suomen Pankki in July.
Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank (ECB), will withdraw from his office in a year's time.
The debate on his successor has begun.
The name of both Rehn and his predecessor, Erkki Liikanen, has been a glimpse of the speeches.
It will probably not hurt if the Finnish names are involved, Rehn said, adding that there is no intention to comment on this further.

Other performances are seen in National Theatre on 2., 8. and 11. October.
On October 23, the black box will visit the Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets available for sale in the National Theatre.
Tampere's performance is sold out.
Tickets sells Lippu.fi.
During the evening, journalists and photographers present on the stage show a long story of their preparation, which has not previously been published in any instrument of the Hs.
There's something to be heard again, which no-one is ever going to hear.
"There is a strange spy in Helsinki overnight, impressive reportage from the other side of the globe and a talking story about a very topical health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of black box.
After the presentation, the public will have the opportunity to meet Hs reporters and photographers and to continue the discussion.
The Helsinki newspaper has organized live journalism for three years.
From the outset they have been popular and often sold out.

The lost mushroom was found thanks to an "unprejudiced experiment"
The Finnish police's drone skills are at the top of the world: "We are being asked about trainings"
According to the rector of the Police College, the police can use the drone in addition to missing searches, for example in crime scene investigations and reconnaissance missions.
On Tuesday, the Oulu police managed to find a lost mushroom maker in Raahe in just a few minutes.
The rector of the University of Applied Sciences, Kimmo Himberg, referred to the incident and mentioned, among other things, that "with an open-minded experiment and effective training, we are the world's tip".
Drone is quite a new thing and even more recent police missions.
Nowhere is there any statistics that the Finnish police would be the champion in the use of drone.
According to Himberg, there is a strong perception that this is the case.
This has survived, for example, when the experience of Finnish police has been reported at international events.
There is a terrible interest in it elsewhere, Himberg says.
It would be very hard for visitors to see the activities of the Finnish police.
We are asked for trainings.
Becomes even more common
Himberg recalls that it is very important to find lost in the winter conditions in Finland as soon as possible.
As stated, in the Raahe case, the stray was found in just a few minutes with the drone.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, they are to be trained more.
The drone is already heavily used in police duties and is becoming more and more common in the future.
So I would dare say, Himberg says.
In addition to the search for missing persons, the police may use drones, for example, in accident and crime investigations and in certain intelligence missions.
For example, there is already a need to check some area for a little longer, where there is a potential fear that violence will be encountered there.
The drone may then be used for pre-enquiry.

Karelian Rugby rose to the first diva
The Karelian Rugby party in Kuopio, on Saturday, has a 2-division victory.
Joensuulaiset were still in the mid-7-12 at the Helsinki Rugby Club in the middle of the match, but found a storyline in the second cycle and whispered the south to 26-12.
The 2-division championship also knew Karelian rugby's historical ascent to the 1st Division.
In the past, the club has been playing in the singles, but at the time the Finnish rugby league was divided into two levels, the SM-sarja and several-tier 1 divisions.
The club is going to take a series of seats, but it knows the next winter very hard work.
The current roster of less than twenty players must be brought up to 25.
The 1 division also knows the number of games and longer game distances, so the fundraising must also be in line with it.
This study has been as effective as sliding doors on a dive boat.

What is a good leader?
There has been much talk of leadership this week in Finland.
The Chairman of Nokia Board, Risto Siilasmaa, told Hs in an interview about his book a paranoid optimist, in which he shed light on his leadership philosophy.
He also criticises the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Ollila.
Ollila disputed the allegations sharply, but in previous Nokia reports the inability of managers to act as a team has been mentioned; The fear and the lack of speech that caused the collapse of the mobile telephony business.
The risk appetite and agility of the company's ascent phase disappeared.
During the week, Helsinki was also a business giant event for the Nordic Business Forum, which drew the Finnish business cream to the exhibition centre.
On the podium was the main star of Barack Obama, with 12 business world stars.
The talk of good leadership was enough.
The legend of the leaders Gary Hamel said that a good leader must dare to take the company to the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are mentally most tied to past decisions.
John Mackey, founder of the wide range of organic Whole Foods, said that the director should know how to communicate with all staff about the purpose of the company.
And that purpose cannot be merely a victory for the owners.
The success of the book's Introverces, written by Susan Cain, reported that the most successful leaders have been proven humble.
They act calmly, quietly and purposefully.
Often they are introverates.
The financial sector professor, Aswath Damodaran, reminded us that the qualities of a good leader must be hit with the life cycle phase of the company.
At the beginning of the company, the director must tell the story to which the company's future is based.
The mature stage of the grown company needs a leader who knows the numbers.
These doctrines in the Nordic Business Forum listened to 7 500 visitors-mostly Finnish leaders.
They had the risk of information colic.
A good leader requires a lot.
Therefore, leadership is so often wrong, even at the highest level.
There were also Siilasmaa and Ollila.
They chatted with each other on the backstage.
However, they were unlikely to wonder whether they were the right leaders at the right time for Nokia.
And their humiliation was not easy for the outside to judge.

Students play a rare pea: the ancient tragedy-the simplistic Oresthesia influences the visual
Ancient tragedies are a rare delicacy on the Finnish scene.
For example, the National Theatre has been seen in the last ancient tragedy, the Sofocles Filoktetes, in 1988.
Now the Theatre Academy brought a tour of the National Theatre to the beginning of the ancient Spectacle trilogy, Aeshyloksen Oresteia.
In 2015, the Blades Open! Projects, theatre Academy students work with the Professional director internationally.
Mikko Roiha, living in Berlin, is the director of this fourth project, as the first.
The international premiere of Oresteia was awarded in Berlin in April.
The atonement of Oresteia sums up the report of the end of the death sentence of the doomed atresia and the birth of the rule of law, to his credit, to hours to twenty minutes, especially through the intensification of choral units.
The work will be very faithful to the spirit of the fine Finnish translation of Kirsti Simonsiali (2003).
Dramatic lights and a revealing presentation of the theatre scene highlight the simple and bright stage thinking.
It is centered on the dynamics of the choir Irtautuvien, the performer of the name roles, and the choir.
The presentation uses both duplicate and three-way name roles.
The actors are not eliminated at all from the scene, so, for example, the Agamemnon of the Trojan War and the murder of the Cassandra in this war of honour are shown on the scene, contrary to the customary tradition of the ancient presentation.
Of course, the presentation does not emphasize that it is faithful to the tradition of the ancient presentation.

He says that crime statistics do not tell the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers obviously argue otherwise.
The police will only be aware of the cases which have been seriously experienced, and many of the correct situations of violence will not be reported.

When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is drawn.
This now seems to have had an effective effect, but this produces a new negative trend.
As a result of the guarding situations, the impression was created that security would be unnecessary.
Now, in many places, we try to find solutions to remove costly guard services.
Mild assault is the plaintiff's offense, and it is quite understandable that no pahoinpidellyksi had a seller to want to make an enquiry about a criminal that usually resides in a shop nearby.

JHL anticipates: Collective action to begin tomorrow will be reflected in children's day care and social and health services
In the public and welfare sectors tomorrow, the overtime and shift bans are shown, especially in social and health services and in children's day care, by the chairman of JHL, Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The effects will be extensive and will certainly be reflected in the way that there are not enough staff on the spot.
Everyone is going to wonder how to apply for their children.
It is now up to the employer to make sure that the services are playing and that nobody's life is threatened, says Niemi-Laine.
According to the Niemi loan, the shortage of workers was also evident at the beginning of the year when the members of JHL were in a ban on overtime and shift in the negotiations.
Through flexibility, employers have made it possible for staff not to be hired, but for employees to be overworked or to have exchanged shifts.
This is not a collective action yet.
It is a norm in the workplace that every worker is treated as a concern for regular working hours and is only done with them.
JHL opposes the actions of government intentions to lighten small business redundancy protection.
Markku Jalonen, the labour market leader of Kunniemployers, does not prejudge the effects of the overtime and shift bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although the services may deteriorate.
Employers around Finland are aware of this and have done the preparations for what needs to be done.
The area is such an impossibly broad, social and health action and technical sector that hard to say.
The effects can vary very much by industry, region and by employer, Jalonen said to the Sts.
Jone says that last week there were already experiences, including the three-day activities of the middle and primary nurses ' super and the social and Health Trade union, which are responsible for the work.
Their effects were quite minor.
The ban on overtime and shift of JHL applies to municipalities, the church, the state and private social and health workers, among others.
For example, Family day carers are limited to outside.
At this stage the collective action is subject to nearly 100 000 JHL members.
According to Niemi loan, JHL'S operations may take a long time.
The Union is also prepared for other collective action if the law on dismissal continues.
The Government should now admit that in this run to the wall and hard.

A large coral reef with children and adults-a presentation in fitness circles
In other modes-the collective large Coral Reef premiered last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was aired a second time in Finland, this time in Kannel House.
Like the group's previous works, a large coral reef is a work that is built from start to finish together with the audience.
However, this time, a clear-track presentation is also being built, which refreshes and sums up the observations made in the initial exercises.
There is also a fairy-tale magic for the children.
The child's perspective has already been included in the preparatory phase of the work.
However, a large coral reef is not a children's presentation, but a presentation that adults and children do in collaboration.
It gives adult information and observations on the way children take information and make art.
The ability of children to throw into the exercises and joint play also is a dirty distance between adults and children.
A large coral reef reminds me of some fairy tale ballet, a fitness circuit and natural facts, but it is definitely being tuned around for visits to other, non-human living spaces.
A large coral reef starts with corals, as well as the exploration of the coral reef and the fish's commercial lines.
In six different gyms, you'll learn, among other things, the rays and the gestures of the sea horse.
Finally, a less than an hour-long presentation with music, lights, and shiny paints and costumes will help you explore the life of the coral reef.
In the large coral reef there are both diving people who observe the coral reef life and corals that are being explored.
In addition, we are examining organisms.
The eyes and observations that are addressed in many directions make the show dense and life-teeming.

Children become mature too fast-I'm happy that my childhood had no smart phones

Video: Dream Paint saved Liverpool's defeat series
Liverpool's 100% Premier League entry was completed, but it was still a happier team in the 1-1-draw at Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday it will be exactly one year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and escaped to the 1-0 guest victory.
At that time, the combination of Pep Guardiola sent a signal to the whole Premier League that City was now in earnest.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And certainly Liverpool manager Jûrgen Klopp arrived with the same idea to west London.
The Reds had started the Premier League with six consecutive victories.
Liverpool started out more strongly and, in particular, Virgil van Dijk seemed to dominate his own field alone.
He was the winner of the Great League Cup in mid-week.
At that time, Eden Hazard emerged from the exchange bench to solve the match with a great individual performance.
Now, the Hazard was, of course, right from the start of the minute.
On the 25th minute he first took a small space with a triangle game with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Eventually, the Croat saw Hazard rushing forward and sent him a perfectly weighted pass.
Hazard drifted to the edge of the penalty area, but bombed the perfect left leg to the rear corner.
The pool's brasserie Alisson was a bit slow in his fight and didn't get like a finger head to the ball.
Klopp certainly felt the defeat of the position lightly unjust, because almost immediately after the succession, Antonio Rüdiger clean sweep Mo Salah's goal line.
In the second period, Chelsea-Veskari Kepa was also in action.
The Basque guard quickly reacted to the tow of Sadio Mané and pushed the ball into a corner-kick.
On the other end, Alisson will be thrown through the passage of hazard.
The best place for guests came 72. Minutes, when James Milner found Bobby Firminon.
However, he was directed towards the team mate David Luzia, who saved the host's lead role.

Sturridge played at his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed it to honor the top of the irresistible bet.
Liverpool's 100% league-start was completed in 1-1, but it is still at the top of the league-together with Manchester city.
Chelsea is also firmly involved in the championship battle with two points behind the tip.

Preferably I would take both, but the bad thing about our location in the North corner of the earth is not possible.

Josba fought a winning guest victory
JOSBA's first guest game in Floorball Divaris produced a full three-point score against Nurmo Jymin.
Jobba went on a home trip to Seinäjoki 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) with a win.
Nurmo was still in paint at the beginning of the third installment, but Josba applied for compositions and recycled men in chains.

The two teams had to play decisive minutes in the ice.

Miika Koonenkin (1 + 0) played in the second chain at the time of the birth.

In the church on Sunday, 200-year anniversary
The 200 anniversary of the Church of Enonkoski is celebrated tomorrow on Sunday in some very sad mood.
The devastation of the church's arson week then was a shock.
Eno's church was guarded in the post-fire two night.
Despite the pain, today is still the place to celebrate.
Although no one would want to, Eno's church now has the oldest church in the Joensuu Parish group.
In the middle of the churchyard the village has always been a heart of Eno despite all the municipalities and other joints in the world.
The family fair starts at Enonkoski in the church today at 10 a.m.
Then we move to the congregation house around a Karelian holding table.

The church's birth celebration also marks the end of one era.

Now there is a dodge in the premises of a former municipal house, "says Markku Koistinen, chaplain.

Elon Musk gives way to the Chair of the board of Tesla-fraud charges were agreed on 40 million dollars
The electric car manufacturer Tesla, and the company's president and CEO, Elon Musk, have agreed to their lawsuit with the U.S. Securities Market Authority, the SEC.
SEC doubted that Musk was guilty of fraud, and Musk was in danger of being sidelined due to the company he founded.
However, Musk may continue as managing director of Tesla.
Instead, Musk will have to give way to the Chairman of the Board of Tesla for three years.
The company is required to recruit the external board chairperson.
Musk is also subjected to stricter control.
According to the agreement, Tesla will have to employ two independent directors to further monitor Musk's communications.
In addition, Tesla and Musk pay both 20 million dollars (approximately EUR 17 million) for the reconciliation of the case.
"The decision is designed to prevent new market failures and the disadvantages of Tesla's shareholders," says Steven Peikki, director of the Seca.
The incident originated in August, when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might withdraw the company from the stock exchange.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding is secured.
At the moment, Tviitti raised Tesla's share rate.
SEC doubted that Muski was guilty of fraud.
According to the agency, the Tviitti was false and misleading, and Musk had not talked about the arrangement with other management or potential donors.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
The SEC announced on Friday that he was challenging the company and Muskin Justice.
The SEC said he would insist that Musk be sentenced to fines and prohibited from operating in the management of listed companies.
It was a challenge for the Sec to be scared by investors, and Tesla's share went into a sharp decline.

An earthquake in Indonesia and tsunami dead over 800 people
In the earthquake in Indonesia and in the ensuing tsunami, the number of deaths has risen to at least 832, says the country's disaster agency's news agency, according to the AFP.
The number of deaths is still expected to increase as the disaster is being resolved.
According to Vice-President Jusuf Kallan, the final figure could rise to thousands.
The Friday earthquake raised the tsunami, which hit the town of Palu on the island of Sulawesi.
The tsunami was given immediately after the quake warning, however, which was promptly canceled.
According to the authorities, almost all known deaths are at least for the time being.
The rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the area of Donggala, the centre of the earthquake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Even now, several people are known to have died.
Rubble of requests for assistance
The Indonesian Army has been alerted to rescuers to help find victims.
In the affected area today, the president either Widodon urged the soldiers to continue their rescue efforts without being exhausted day and night.

Muhammad Syaugi, head of the agency for rescue work, reported that the ruins of the Roa-Roa hotel, which was favored by business travellers, were one person alive in the night.

Among other things, the telephone numbers of the ministers were accessed by the Troublei.
This was the application used by the government in the British Conservative Party congress.
For example, the Minister for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Mr Gove, and former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, are being harassed by BREXIIT.
Several members of the MPs received harassment calls.
Due to the lack of encryption in the app, the audience was able to access the politicians ' profiles at the Conservative Party's annual mobile app.
The public got access to profiles using the politician's email address. Which was readily available online.
To log in to the profile, you could watch and edit the content stored in the profile.
Someone managed to change the profile picture of Boris Johnson for a moment and to be a soloist of the title.
Michael Goven's profile was changed to the image of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian's columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting application allows you to sign in to other people's profiles using these email addresses.
The login can then view the contact information for the profile person and, for example, send messages in this name.
The meeting application made the phone number of every journalist, politician and participant public, Foster criticized.
A Conservative spokesman asked for the information to be excised.
He said that technical problems have been solved and the application is now working safely.
The British authority ICO supported data leakage.
The application was prepared by the Australian company Crown Comms.

Every week, the Wall Finnish quiz audience has a large number of pating poles
Eye-catching viewers drew attention to The response of The Wall Finnish quiz show to The studio audience.
In The world of fast-spreading American format, The Wall landed in The Finnish version for Nelonen last Saturday.
The game show, hosted by Heikki Paasonen, is filmed in Poland in the same studio, where other international productions are made in the format.
In the Polish studio, the possibilities for shooting were exceptional, as the format of the Big 12 metre-high game wall demanded space for the farm.
During the initial period, the social media revealed the programme's studio audience, which was veisted.
On Twitter, there was a debate about whether the studio might sit in a game of Polish in Finnish.
Unne Sormunen, head of Nelonen domestic programs, illuminates the issue with the evening newspaper.
He tells us that the studio audience is the players ' close-up, other Finns, expatriates in Poland, and just the poles.
The audience is made up of international tapeters in Finnish production, as well as The audiences of other countries in The same production space.
In Finland, too, there are such piglets, so-called professional audiences, who go to the descriptions of the various programmes, with the background of Sormunen.
He reminds us that playing a game in itself is not so difficult to comprehend, even if it doesn't understand the language in which it is played.
It is easy to distinguish between the red and green balls.
In the foreign language studio, however, there are interpreters who manage the translation work.
There are two interpreters, who, as simultaneous interpreters, interpret the studio-instructor all the time events.
And the studio instructor will then instruct the audience and tell you what kind of flap there, for example, is thrown and what the situation is going, Sormunen says.
He compares the situation with the way in which David Hasselhoff recently acted in domestic production.
David Hasselhoff was a few years ago involved in Talent Finland's photo shoots in Finland.
He became a simultaneous interpretation of the ear, and he knew all the descriptions were spoken in Finnish, Sormunen sums up.

The number of visitors to the bread Day continued to
The mother of Bread Day Pirkko Hyvärinen wonders about the audience of the event in the Big Hall grandstand.
Somehow, it was thought that perhaps this year the crowd would come, Hyvärinen wonders this morning.
In the autumn of 2017 the SM-liiga was held at the same time as the bread day, so perhaps the expectations would be that the audience could even be slightly lowered from the previous year.
The other way, however, happened; The corridors were getting clogged before ten, the sellers reported that the products were exhausted, the news porridge was sold more nearly 500 servings, and in the number of cars Hyvärinen heard there was a rise.
The estimated number of visitors has been around 6000, Hyvärinen says later in the afternoon.
For the first five hours of the morning and afternoon, there was a special programme for Families with children, which would entice them to record much of the show.
In addition, Hyvärinen evaluates the event to reach a greater distance.

7 x Most Beautiful lamp-here you'll recognize a good lamp
Bring your room to life, create the right atmosphere for your interior and read the book without getting tired of your eyes.
You should invest in good lighting.
We gathered together three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were delivered by Finnish sales and marketing director Tarja Jokiniemi.
Make a favor for your eyes
The greater the importance of illumination, the more the ages are behind.
Sufficient light can be used to help with problems that many become with age when the visual acuity decreases and more and more glare is affected.
Vanhemmiten also increases the need for light.
The Sixties needs a light three times more than their twenties.
So, for health reasons, you should invest in the effects of light and the characteristics of the luminaire.
A good lamp gives enough light, but does not dazzle, River Peninsula tips.
Create a beauty around you
The beautiful interior is only accessible with the right lighting solutions.

It is popular with the Japanese style, which unites the scandinavianism and Japanism.

The materials now appear in wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Be a joy to your personality
On the other hand, more is being invested than before, and the interior has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, your own home wants a tailor-made, bold lamp with a story to tell.
People are clearly searching for Finnish and Scandinavian products whose origins and designers are known.
So we are very design conscious, Jokiniemi says.
The home is not necessarily the latest trend lamp, but a timeless classic that has been saved for many years.
Certain timeless, rustic and elegant classics keep their guns from one year to the next, says Jokiniemi.

The action of sabotage by Russian intelligence services has a long tradition
There is no reason to suppose that the Russian Federation's foreign inquiry SVR or military intelligence GRU would have abandoned this modus operandi.
During the Soviet period, the activities of sabotage were specialised by the so-called DRG groups.

A true story today on TV: a climber left for death twice
The American Beck Weathers wrote 18 years ago a book.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on the man's own experiences.
The film of the evening is made based on them.
Everest will now be premiered on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating snowstorm surprised climbers at Mount Everest.
The control of Baltasar Kormákuri's 2015 is about a struggle for survival, which has been treated as a very lively one.
The tragedy has been done in movies-and documentaries-before.
True events are also being conducted in this story.
22 years ago, the world's tallest mountain took eight climbers ' lives.
Two of them were experienced leaders of the expedition: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall that served as a guide to Weatheri.
The spirit of the Weatheri was able to save the eye surgery taken before departure to Nepal.
As a result of its and atmospheric pressure, he lost sight, which is why the peak conquest had to be missed.
Rob Hall continued his journey and no longer returned.
Weatheri's struggle for life and death had only just begun.
As the storm rises he was lost and no longer found back in the camp.
When the men came to search, he was found in such poor condition that the survival was not entrusted.
Weathers left for death.
Miraculously, however, he was still on his feet and found the others.
Badly-healed weatheri were thought to be still dying and once again he was left to fend for himself.
It is clear that contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, the climbers began to believe in the possibility of being given assistance.
In the movie Beck Weathersia is made by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer of Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley, and Emily Watson.
Without him, we are a dying flock who is not going to receive reinforcements.

Today is the celebrated 200-year-old Eno church
ENO's 200-year-old church is celebrated today on the Church Hill.
The church was inaugurated on 4 December. On October 1818, and in celebration of the Jubilee year, Sunday was prepared for the whole family celebration.
The celebrations started at 10 a.m. on the Church hill at the family Fair, after which there was a Karelian holding table in the city of Eno's Parish hall.
The church was full.
The family of Mesoral participated in 517 people.
Eno's vicar Armi Rautavuori was glad that people had come to church so much.
It is a great pleasure for a long time and gives strength to work, Iron Mountain (pictured) says.
The fire of the Church of Kiihtelvaara has touched many and was not overlooked in the 200 anniversary celebration of Eno Parish.

Pictures and videos: The Mediani flashed might in Greece-the sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A powerful hurricane-type autumn storm rolled on Saturday from southwest to Greece.
The Medikhan is a Mediterranean hurricane named Zorbe.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red weather warning for Attica, the Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades and Crete.
Images captured in the area show plenty of flooding around Greece.
A video published on Twitter shows how between the houses of Kiaton in the Korinthian region suddenly appeared instead of the street due to the flooding in the river.
The second video shows how the car has been subjected to flood-water transport.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese peninsula the harsh wind caused strong sea shipping.
The Embassy of Finland in Athens instructs people on their Facebook pages to prepare for a storm in Greece.
The delegation calls for the monitoring of weather reports and local authority guidelines.
A Mediterranean hurricane, or a mediane, brings with it heavy rainfall and even a flood hazard.
According to the Cnn's study, a 2011 published in the survey shows that medians only occur once or twice a year throughout the world, typically around September-October, when the sea temperature is still high.
The now-blowing storm left a flood of floods in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey to the north and towards Europe.
Concern in Greece has also been caused by refugee camps in islands such as Lesvos.
The thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in the camps are limited in scope to a decent shelter.
In summer, the areas devastated by the fires also fall under the storm in the surroundings of Athens.
The media was also raging in Greece last November.

In addition, a few hundred passengers are vacationing in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm in the island of Kos is likely to reach on Sunday morning.
On the other hand on Saturday afternoon, Rhodes had been mocking the sun and the temperature of your pain to 27 º C, the Sun's Ikonen says.
Zorbis has been estimated to move to the next Turkish riesis, albeit with a slight relaxation.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and, for example, have checked the number of Finns who have been flying in Antalya, says Schroderus.

Vehicle safety is always the responsibility of the auxiliary passenger.
The vehicles are constantly senses around the environment with several sensors and assess whether the router is free.

The police Department of Eastern Finland conducted a hunting control on Friday and Saturday with the Metsähallitus and the Finnish game Centre in North Karelia and Upper Savo, the Police department's batch correspondents told the social media on Saturday.
The main focus of supervision was on the legality and the promise of hunting.
A hunting card was inspected for each hunter and a hunting licence is required for the state's countries.
In addition, the quantity of the permitted quantities of firearms used for the purposes of the use of hunting firearms were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the surveillance, and only one hunter was found to be in control, who lacked the required hunting permit.
A 12 day fine was imposed on the hunter for unauthorized catching.
In addition, the police blasted 133 vehicle driver, and two of them are suspected of drunk driving.
In addition, patrols dealt with five traffic offences in the case of fines, police times.
To sum up, hunters have a very good respect for hunting.
Many hunters were surprised by the control.
One hunter stated that "I hunted the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone checked the permits".
The police Department of Eastern Finland continues to control hunting in the autumn, along with the other supervisory authorities.

The Mykönen leaves Turkey to follow the election of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of the Interior Kai Mykönen (ECR), travels in the coming days to Turkey to monitor the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
It has been decided to 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps in Finland this year.
The choice of journeys is usually made twice a year, with representatives from the Immigration Office, the Ministry of Labour and the economy and the police.
The delegation is already in the process of conducting interviews in Turkey.
The Un Refugee Organisation (UNHCR) first chooses the candidate who is particularly vulnerable.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be particularly vulnerable in refugee camps, such as lone parent families, the disabled and the sick, women and children.
In Finland, more people are selected than in the quota, because in practice the part is left not to appear for different reasons.
He also meets with the Turkish Minister of Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu and the Syrian border NGOs.
The office also includes the Secretary of the Ministry of Interior Ilkka Salmi.
The talk of increasing the quota
Finland has already taken quota refugees since the 1970.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees a year.
The quota was 1 050 a year for a couple of years, but the government did not subsequently have the agreement to raise it.
The coalition has supported the lifting of the quota, but the project has been the last to fall on the blue resistance.
The prime Minister, Juha Sipilä (center), recently made a gradual increase of the quota to 1 500-2 000 people per year.
During this reign, the visit of the silent government is the first to be made by the Minister of the Interior to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The previous ministers of the Interior, Petteri Orpo (ECR) and Paula Risikko (ECR), could move on to their new tasks before the visits were organised.
Finland receives a subsidy of EUR 10 000 from the Eu for each of the particularly vulnerable refugees.

Now let's go astray-no longer know whether to cry or laugh
In the last Saturday, Karjalainen reported a draft law amending the animal Welfare law.
The article gave the impression that, in principle, the draft law prohibits the keeping of all animals not specifically permitted by ministerial decrees, in relation to the production, pets or otherwise, in the context of business activities.
In other words, not all the animals mentioned in the regulation are prohibited in principle.
If the bill comes into law, it will mean that we are abandoning in Western democracies the general principle that the law specifically prohibits action which endangers the safety or good practice of society.
We are now in the process of imposing a ban on all activities to which the law or regulation does not expressly permit.
The change will cause nothing new to be tried, for example, in a business operation, and do nothing else until the law or regulation that approves it is adopted.
In general, the Government's activities in the preparation of the law have been weak.
If we now start from the path that, in Finland as a priori, everything is forbidden, which is not explicitly permitted, no longer knows whether to cry or laugh.
I have no doubt that the animal welfare law would require an update.
But the legislative project in this direction is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I am not very familiar with the Constitution, but I wonder whether it will accept such ' everything is forbidden by law or regulation '.
Hopefully there will be some sensible minister who will interrupt the progress of such a law project.
The point shows the central assessment, and the line shows uncertainty over the confidence interval of 95%.
The best possible answer would be a ticket-somewhere, which will surely happen in a certain place at a certain time.

Kimi Raikkonen summed up the reason for the superiority of Merdeksen compared to Ferrari
Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen got admits that the worst competitor for Mercedes was too hard to piece in the Russian GDR in time.
In a Ferrari camp, however, there is no reason to be led by an experienced driver.
They just were faster than us, but no huge issue is at stake.
Our car was in time-time for the best for the whole weekend so far, but they just were too fast, fourth-raced and teammate Sebastian Vittelin with a Mercedes-speed clearly escaped Raikkonen said.
Ferrari was already difficult in the previous race in Singapore.
He was asked where the sudden fall of the Mercedez was due.
They seem to go faster than we do-so simple it is.
If I knew the reason for that, we would probably go the same pace as they do.
However, I do not know more than anyone else.
This is a constant guesswork, and they seem to be ahead of us now.

It was in it-Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan teperi: "Robbe is Back"
The match between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teperi in Stuttgart's evenings progressed smoothly.
The German was a more proactive party, but he did not get a decent hits.
Helenius clearly had a great control over the game with his hard horns, which were well found.

The hurricane Zorbas strikes Greece during the weekend.
Prepare yourself for it if you are staying in the Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, villages and Crete.
The storm is very powerful, so the Embassy of Finland in Athens announces it on its Facebook pages.
According to the grand approach, the Greek meteorological service has given the regions a red weather warning.
The impending storm also tells the weather service on the Forecan blog.
The toughest gusts in the storm are up to 45 meters per second.
In comparison, the storm of Kuisma, which was Finnish from the beginning of the week, blew up a 30 metre per second.
The blog says that the main concern of the Zorbas storm is not wind, but heavy rains.
At the weekend in southern Greece can come more than 300 millimeters of water.
It is responsible for about half of Finland's annual rainfall.
Weather Service The Severe Weather Europa has shared a video about the evolution of the storm on his Facebook page.

Valtteri Bottas shook and Purwolf adrenaline in Sochi-will he be the helper of Hamilton on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas was shaking a little for dozens of minutes after the Russian GP's pole position in the front of the media.
The great tour left behind the first star of the Mercedes, Lewis Hamilton, and was mentally bound to have an important critique of the Finnish riders who picked this season.
Nice round.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left the solution round.
Feels good, shaking a bit even more, Botttas explained.
I have been on a pile only once this year, in Austria (in mid-summer), so time has passed quite a while.
This track has been good for me in the past, and I got again some good laps.
It's not easy to skip the track at the Sotshin, so the output is a particularly big role.
And, of course, Bottas was able to answer for a swim, whether he would drive for a victory tomorrow, or whether the front of the world Championship was approaching Hamilton's Jesus.
My starting point for the race is definitely that I try to win.
Not on the pile when leaving the other target may be, Bottas piles.
But in the stables we fight for both titles.
Lewis ' leadership Sebastian in the list is pretty big and the difference struck me very big, so it must keep in mind.
Let's see what happens, Bottas, however, complemented.
After the ride, Hamilton was genuinely happy with the success of Bottas, and the team-boss Toto Wolffin has been tasted.
Lewis had the intent to defeat Valtteri, but he did not manage to win in the bend.
Valtteri knows he has to rip all of himself to defeat Lewis.
And he was so charged, that the adrenaline of the purwolf from the ears out, Wolff annealed.
The question is whether the stables in Bottas and Hamilton were to be run by a soloist, Wolff was forced to dodge.
We will be discussing tomorrow morning, and we will see how the race departs.
I thank God that he is a cheater and not a dying.

The Finnish Championships
The SM-sarja for rally car ended rarely.
Almost never before, the brothers have ended up as champions of Finland at the same time.
Now it was decided by the Tuusula Eerik and Henrik Pietäinen in a rally around Turku and Salo, as Eric won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 classes.
He made the best achievement in his career when the third place in the final race sealed him the Finnish championship in the SM4 class of two-wheel drive cars.
With Honda Civic's rival Kinnunen and co-driver Ville Mäkelä started the Turku race with Maltilla, as the starting points were clear: the ranking in the top group would guarantee the SM title.

Syria urges the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops
The Syrian foreign Minister calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Foreign Minister Walid Muallem, who spoke at the Un General Assembly on Saturday, says that foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and unconditionally.
Muallem said that foreign troops are in Syria fighting against terrorism, and the war against terrorists is ' almost over '.
In his UN speech, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees that they would return to their home country.

Not quite Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans looked at the Supreme Court judge drama on TV
The judge of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, received an exceptionally large number of people.
In the United States, the drama of the Supreme Court, which is full of power, received at least 20 million people in the television on Thursday.
At the time, Mr. Kavanaugh, a Californian professor in charge of the harassment of Donald trumpet, were in front of the Senate Justice Committee to tell their story.
According to preliminary results, the consultations followed the following six main channels: ABB, Cbs, Cnn, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC with a total of 20.4 million spectators.
Their addition to online consultation followed a further number of millions more.
On the record, NBC reported that 6.8 million people followed, and CNN reported a year's high score of 8.2 million live broadcast.
The number of Cnn's rises to more than 10 million, when you count on YouTube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also reached 8.0 million starting.
Digital startups are the channels ' own, TV viewers are sourced from research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen publishes final readings on Monday, but they are in any case staggering.
Few reach 20 million
In the United States, more than 20 million viewers are usually only sporting matches, and the major Academy Awards and Grammy Awards for the entertainment world, as well as occasional political events such as speeches by presidents and in 2016 also Presidential debates.
In the USA's most watched program, the NFL Football League final match for Super Bowl is certainly a journey.
This year, the Super Bowl gathered on the NBC channel about 103 million people.
Last year, trumpet's first speech to Congress was, according to Nielsen, a total of nearly 48 million people and the inauguration of over 30 million people.
Top priority
The judge of the Supreme Court is an extremely important case in the USA, as the posts are lifelong.
Trump already named one new judge when Anton's Scalia died in early 2016 and the Republicans succeeded in preventing the then President Barack Obama from appointing his successor.
The second place was helping when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced this year to retire.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but on several issues he was the so-called scales language, whose voice was able to resolve the nine-intellectual court's position.
He was a supporter of the right to abortion and the rights of LGBT and, for example, in 2015, it was his voice to resolve the same-sex marriage law throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative than its positions.
His election to the Supreme Court may lock the right of the conservative overpower for decades.

Children have the right to their knowledge of parents
Only parents of children under the age of 10 see their children's health information on the loyalty service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong and it's strange.
Originally, the situation of the loyal service was, of course, even more worrying: the parents were not able to look at even the little health information or recipes.
In the autumn of 2016, a temporary characterisation was obtained for children under 10 years of age.
Since then, the practice has been promised to be corrected, but it has been an amazingly long time to repair.

Relief organizations are preparing to start work in Indonesia's Sulawesi-"clean water is it's most urgent"
The United Nations Children's organisation UNICEF and other international relief organisations are on hand to assist on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, says Kirsi Haru, Finnish UNICEF information manager.
Local authorities are leading the rescue work, but the need for additional assistance is already evident at this stage.
UNICEF operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-standing programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operation, UNICEF always has a full emergency preparedness, says Haru.
The first task now is to find people in the rubble, both survivors and dead.
In the town of Palu in Sulawesi, the rescue operations are underway, but the situation in the Donggala region slightly farther north is less pronounced.
There are still places where connections are not working.
The interventions are difficult because the roads too are cut, says Haru.
The buildings are often lightweight in Sulawesi, so the earthquake and tsunami damage are great.
Once the survivors have been found, they need protection – next to the top for example tents – and clean water.
Clean water is in crisis situations it's most urgent.
The first is that people are usually able to offer the water purification tablets that UNICEF has in store.
Water systems are designed to be corrected as soon as possible, but in emergency cases water is transported to the first time, for example, by the rails.

Billionaire Elon Musk concludes as chairman of Tesla board-$20 million in tweets
The founder of the Space Rockets and electric vehicles company Elon Musk avoids fraud charges with the Us Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk terminates its role as chairman of the Board of the electric car company Tesla and agrees to the $20 million in fines.
Musk gives way to the task as part of an agreement that he concluded with the Us authority for securities markets.
By agreeing to Musk avoid fraud charges.
The Us Securities Commission, the SEC, threatened to black with securities fraud because of the tweets he sent in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing the withdrawal of the electric vehicle company Tesla from the stock exchange, which led to a rapid rise in the company's share price.
According to the agreement, Musk shall not be the Chairman of the Board of Tesla for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new "independent member" to its government and take on two "independent directors" of its management team.
Tesla must also set up a committee to monitor the Black communications.
Musk is still allowed to continue as CEO of Tesla.
In addition to Black's personal $20 million, the Tesla company has to pay the equivalent of 20 million to the financial controller.
Tweet
According to the SECC, the Musk's tweets led to investors and the Tesla shareholders were misled.
Musk argued that he would have secured the funding to buy Tesla from the stock Exchange back to a private limited company.
According to the billionaires ' tweets, the company would have been bought off the stock exchange for a 420 dollar share price.
Tesla's share price rose by more than 10 per cent a day after the tweets, but declined later.
According to the SECC, there was no basis for Muski's arguments.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated the financing he claimed.
Nor had he discussed withdrawing from the stock exchange with the rest of the management team or the Board of Directors.
This Friday's course fell 14 percent, when the securities officer of the SEC reported fraud charges.
The news agreement is expected to re-confirm the company's course.

The account mentions that the last Judgment is not a reason to stop the clock.
