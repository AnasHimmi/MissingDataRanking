The number of recruits from Ukraine preparing to be sent to Donbass is announced
The official representative of the People's Police of the self-proclaimed Lugansk People's Republic (LNR) Andrei Marochko said that in the winter of 2018-2019 Ukraine will send to Donbass at least 3 thousand recruits.
According to him, in this way Kiev plans "at least somehow to complete the units".
"The unwillingness of citizens of Ukraine to serve in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, mass layoffs led to a low staffing of units", - said Marochko, who is quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that the real numbers of Ukrainians conscripted to the army can be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched the so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by the United Forces operation (OOS).
It was assumed that this measure would strengthen the role of the Ukrainian security forces in the settlement of the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbass escalated due to the murder of the head of the Donetsk People's Republic Alexander Zakharchenko.
The authorities of the Donetsk People's Republic qualified the incident as a terrorist attack.
During the investigation of the criminal case, several people involved in the explosion were detained.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the sabotage was organized by the Ukrainian special services.

Ilon Musk has to leave the post of head of the board of directors of Tesla
The US Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla founder Ilon Musk settled their dispute in the case of fraud.
It is reported by CNBC News.
According to the TV channel, as part of the agreements reached, Musk will have to leave the post of head of the board of directors of Tesla.
At the same time, the commission allowed Musk to keep the post of head of Tesla.
As noted, the founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
A similar amount will be charged from Tesla.
At the same time, the money will be distributed among the affected investors.
In addition, the company should appoint two independent directors.
Ilon Musk is an American entrepreneur, one of the 50 richest people on the planet according to Forbes magazine.
He is the head of the space corporation SpaceX, the neurotech company Neuralink and the developer of electric cars Tesla, as well as the co-founder of Paypal.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has previously sued Tesla CEO Ilon Musk because of his message, published on Twitter, about the possible buyback of the company.
Last month, Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy back all shares on the stock exchange at a fixed price of $420.
The cost of the share of $420 was set allegedly "because of the importance of this number in the culture of marijuana", reported earlier Bloomberg, citing co-director of the security department of the commission Stephen Peykin.
At the same time, Ilon Musk later refused his plans to buy back the shares.
Commenting on the lawsuit filed against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman said that he considers the charges of fraud unfounded, and added that he is very disappointed and saddened by these claims.
"Honesty is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I have not violated it in any way", the businessman said in an interview with CNBC.
At the same time, in August, a group of shareholders of Tesla filed a collective lawsuit against Musk, complaining about the financial losses.
The plaintiffs claimed that the posts of the businessman brought them losses.
In particular, one of the shareholders said that the tweets of the businessman misled, because of which the sellers of shares of Tesla were forced to buy securities at artificially inflated prices to cover their positions.
Other plaintiffs also noted that Ilon Musk's careless statements led to sharp fluctuations in the exchange rate.
In September, Ilona Musk accused the head of research company Citron Research of exchange fraud.
Meanwhile, if Musk could not settle his dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, he would be at risk of being removed from the company's management and even a prison.
This, in particular, was stated to CNBC by former chairman of the commission Harvey Pitt.
Musk is "a good guy who can't manage a car company".

On September 30, 1928, that is exactly 90 years ago, the British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming announced an unprecedented discovery.
The discovery of penicillin marked the beginning of the era of modern antibiotics, brought Fleming worldwide fame and made him a Nobel laureate.
By the way, the release of penicillin from mold mushrooms was not the first discovery of Fleming.
A few years earlier, being cold, he sowed mucus from his own nose on a cup of Petri (this is a glass lid in which experiments with bacteria are carried out) and a few days later found that the bacteria there were destroyed.
Almost as accidentally they found penicillin.
Fleming's name was included in the list of 100 most outstanding personalities in the history of mankind.
Its discovery, according to many scientists, changed the course of history.
With the help of penicillin, medicine began to cope with most of the oldest diseases previously considered incurable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene.
When, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, Fleming arrived in the French capital in 1945, the Paris newspapers wrote: "He did more than dozens of divisions to defeat fascism and liberate France".
According to experts, Fleming's discovery of the world's first antibiotic saved the lives of more than 200 million inhabitants of the Earth.
Alexander Fleming died in his home in London in 1955 from a heart attack.
It was cremated, and a week later its ashes were buried in the famous London Cathedral of St. Paul.
Where, by the way, our wife and I paid attention to it by the verbal Russian-speaking guide.

Trump talks about "love" in Kim Jong-un
From mutual cruelty, the leaders of the US and North Korea have almost fallen in love with each other, Donald Trump joked.
US President Donald Trump has been marked by a successful joke about his successes at the front of resolving the North Korean crisis.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, now the leaders of the two countries have corrected relations so much that they are almost in love with each other, the American president said.
The owner of the White House recalled that he accepted the North Korean problem from the previous administration as the main difficulty in foreign policy.
Trump noted that Barack Obama's team had so launched relations with North Korea that it could not even call the country's leadership - they simply did not remove the phone.
At that time, the US and North Korea were on the verge of war, and today the North Korean leader writes "fine letters" to the White House, Trump said.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work he was also "cruel" to Kim Jong-un, which, however, was mutual.
But now their relationship has improved so much that the leaders "fell in love with each other".
At the same time, Trump asked not to take his words literally, and warned that the US media would interpret them as incompetence.
Trump has pointed out that Pyongyang has recently stopped nuclear and missile tests, and is closing military ranges.
All this is the merits of the work of his administration, the American president is sure.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump flatly spoke about Kim Jong-un from the rostrum of the UN General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for the courage and steps taken to de-escalate tensions.
At the same time, Trump noted that sanctions against North Korea will continue until the full denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
Talks in Singapore
On June 12, Singapore hosted the first ever talks between the leaders of the United States and North Korea.
After a serious aggravation of relations and mutual threats to the use of nuclear weapons, the summit looked like a turning point in the protracted US-Korean crisis.
Following the talks, the sides expressed their intention to move towards a peaceful resolution of the contradictions, although they did not assume any legal obligations.
The positive results of the meeting were the cessation of North Korea's nuclear and missile tests, as well as the return to the United States of the remains of American soldiers in the country.
At the same time, other practical steps toward denuclearization of North Korea are still stalling.
The media reported that after the Singapore summit, the US had already sent several disarmament scenarios to North Korea, but Pyongyang rejected them, calling them "gangster".

Nice called to replace the "Moscow language with the Ukrainian product"
Ukrainian children's writer and fighter for the purity of the native language Larisa Nice called to displace from Ukraine "Russian-speaking Moscow product and Moscow language".
She proposes to do it with a Ukrainian product - "cultural wave, cultural onslaught".
Nice shared her thoughts about the "expediency of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine" with the Ukrainian edition "Observer".
According to her, the corresponding Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it even already exists and continues to develop further.
Over time, Ukrainians will "recover" from this "Moscow language", she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, she said, earlier on television and radio widely used Russian speech, but in the public space it is practically not left.
At the same time, according to Nice, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, are only "expanding the boundaries for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level".
Earlier, Nice shared her experience of maintaining the "Ukrainian-speaking regime" in a children's camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened to court a network of bookstores Watsons, the cashier of one of which communicated with her in Russian.
Without having achieved the, Nice threw in the girl delivery.
She calls the use of Russian words by Ukrainians "language schizophrenia", calling on Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in writing surnames.
Recently, Nice said that the name "Russia" was stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
The anger of the writer could not be avoided even by the Security Service of Ukraine: coming there and hearing the conversations of employees with each other in Russian, she made a scandal and left, slamming the door.

Violations registered at the referendum in Macedonia
Four incidents related to violations of electoral legislation were registered in the Republic of Macedonia in a referendum on an intergovernmental agreement with Greece on renaming.
This was reported on Sunday by the press secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Tony Angelovsky.
Since the opening of polling stations, 4 incidents have been recorded, which have been eliminated ", he said.
At the polling station in the primary school "Lazo Angelowski" in Skopje, 22-year-old K. violated public order and tranquility, insulted citizens and attacked the police.
He was detained and taken to the police station.
According to the representative of the Foreign Ministry, all the violators were immediately taken to the police stations.
The Ministry noted that all violations are being checked.
"The Ministry will act in accordance with the law, so that citizens can safely use the constitutional right to freely express their will.
We call on citizens to observe the laws and refrain from any violations of public order and tranquility and any violation of the secrecy of voting ", the representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs said.
Citizens during the referendum on Sunday are asked to answer one question: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?"
The referendum is intended to resolve the 27-year dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav Republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek region.
On June 17, the Foreign Ministers of Macedonia and Greece signed an agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic during a solemn ceremony on the shore of Lake Presa, which runs the border between the two countries.
It provides for the use of the name "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
This treaty should solve not only a long-term dispute about the name of the country, but also open Skopje's way to NATO and the EU.
But you still try to calm down and sit down better.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, Russia was almost absent in a negative way
Head of the Federation Council Committee on Foreign Affairs Konstantin Kosachev considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly successful for Russia and does not rule out that it can become a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in the solution of global problems.
"The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric to which we have almost got used in recent years to Russia, has now been much more muted", - said the senator in an interview published on Sunday "Rossiyskaya Gazeta".
He explained that in previous years Russia was sometimes "designated as one of the three main threats to humanity, then along with Ebola, then along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this row, at least in the statement of a group of Western countries, which in this regard expressed quite unanimously".
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed ", the issue of Russia in a negative way was practically absent".
"If you carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Germany, I now do not take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, the choir was not absolutely accurate", - drew the attention of the politician, noting that Russia "was no longer some wall, which trains blows tennis ball".
The head of the relevant committee of the Security Council does not rule out that this indicates a certain trend, which, in his opinion ", will highlight the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although this trend may fully manifest in a year, in two, three".
"I do not rule out that the current session in a sense can be a turning point", Kosachev admitted, explaining that "there are too many examples of how with Russia's involvement it is possible to move forward in international affairs".
As an example, he cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"Unfortunately, this is not Ukraine yet, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time", added the MP.
This is due to the fact, he believes, that there is "an adequate, sound perception of Russia as not just a possible - an integral participant in solving global problems of our time".
"I would not like to make a mistake, but I have a feeling that we are somewhere passing a point beyond which the movement will no longer be a movement back, it will be a movement forward", he added.
Another "interesting and important feeling" in this context Kosachev called "the request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop".
"I attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I saw with great pleasure that if a year or two or five years ago, no one was interested in the Russian opinion, the Russian vision of what is happening in the world, now the situation is different", - said the chairman of the Committee of the Security Council.
According to him, this is due to the fact that "the so-called new liberal order, which embodies with the West, has no answers to the questions how to solve the world problems due to the obvious shortage of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas on how to solve the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the problems of migration".
"And here the request for the Russian vision becomes more and more obvious", - Kosachev expressed confidence, stressing that in this sense he considers "the current session successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia".

Damascus declared its right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that in the Syrian province of Idlib will not have to use military force, said Foreign Minister of the Syrian Arab Republic Walid Moallem.

The Minister added that Turkey has an opportunity to quickly solve the problem of withdrawal of militants of the banned in Russia organization Jabhat al-Nusra from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, RIA Novosti reported.
The Foreign Minister also stressed that Damascus will have to resort to a military solution to the problem of territories east of the Euphrates in case the Kurds seek separatism.
At the same time, according to Moallem, negotiations with the Kurdish SDF forces were good until they were interrupted because of the US.
On September 17, Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed to create a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between the armed opposition and government troops in the Syrian province of Idlib by October 15.

In addition, the Foreign Minister of the neighboring country was found to be "direct threats of invasion of Ukraine" and "support for separatist sentiments in Ukraine", as well as to participate "in the organization of a provocation aimed at mass violation of the legislation of Ukraine by citizens of Ukraine".
It should be noted that in front of Siyjarto in the "Purgatory" landed the deputy of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra Pavel and the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow patriots) Onufry.
The reason was their opposition to receiving Tomos by the Ukrainian local church.

The authorities named the amount of the "golden parachute" Voronezh deputy governor
A one-time payment of 23 salaries to the deputy governor of the Voronezh region Yuri Agibarov made on the basis of the regional law "On public positions".

Such explanations were provided by the press service of the regional government.
According to the law, the salary of Agibarov's position is 11,189 rubles.

His experience in public office is more than nine years.
Assignment of this pension and one-time payment is made immediately after dismissal from office, explained to the agency "RIA Novosti" in the government of the region.

Agibarov was released from office in connection with the expiration of the term of office of the acting head of the region.
Similarly, the powers of other officials who held public positions in the region ended.
On September 29, Telegram channel "Nezygar" published documents, from which it follows that Agibarov, who left the post of vice-governor, was paid a severance allowance in the amount of 23 salaries, and two days later he again received a similar position without the prefix "vrio".

It is worth fighting this at the level of educational institutions and family, the deputy added.
Gennady Onishchenko, State Duma deputy (in an interview with the radio station "Moscow says":
As part of the general sex education of children, this should be done by explaining the pangs, because there is a certain risk to the sexual health of the child, both the boy and the girl.
The problem is objective, it is that the ripening of children comes early enough, and then there are large scissors between their puberty and the ability to officially enter into intersex contacts.
According to Onishchenko, the solution of the problem is hampered by "bigotry", silence of "problems of sexual age" and lack of culture of adequate education of children.
The doctor is sure that many teenagers face Nazism.
The MP believes that it is first of all worth practicing lessons about the harm of onanism in schools of "hyperbanized" regions.

AfD became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany is breaking another record of popularity, and Angela Merkel's ratings are falling.
It seems that German citizens have become seriously tired of Angela Merkel's immigration policy, which has made the country a desirable target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
Recent polls show this most clearly, according to which the anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland party is becoming more popular, and the positions of the ruling bloc Merkel and Seehofer are weakening.
This week, the AfD broke another record, rising to second place in the ranking of popular sympathies.
Right-wing conservatives, with 17 percent of their popularity, managed to beat the Social Democrats, who have about 16 percent.
The gap of one percentage point can be attributed to statistical error, but it should be noted that the AfD created in 2013 from a small group of Euroskeptic economists has become a serious political force.
The leadership in the overall standings is still held by the ruling CSU / CDU bloc, which has about 30 percent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points - back in April, support for Angela Merkel's bloc was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48 percent of Germans support Angela Merkel, which is 7 percent lower than last year.
We add that the Social Democrats are followed by the "green" (15%), the left (11%) and the liberals (10%).
The Evolution of Alternatives
The Alternative für Deutschland (Alternative für Deutschland) party was established in September 2012 on the basis of the Alternative für 2013 group, which included members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially opposed the government's course, but initially dealt only with economic issues, including the problems of the euro and cooperation within the EU.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany's "sponsorship" of weak EU economies, did not rule out the possibility of a return to the German mark and a complete withdrawal from the EU.
Against the background of the deepening immigration crisis, the AfD's political platform has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full-fledged party that took the niche of Euroskeptics and began to criticize the government harshly for the failure of immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the AfD managed to break into the Bundestag for the first time, receiving 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of Alternative für Deutschland get seats in the European Parliament.

Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov's words, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee on Television and Radio Broadcasting of Nezalezhnaya began to fight literature, which has the slightest hint of criticism of the Kiev authorities, banning the import of as many as 201 publications.

Canadians created a car in case of apocalypse - magazine Behind the wheel
Anyone can buy this car.
The company Roshel Defence Solutions said that it is already accepting applications for its new armored vehicle.
Roshel Senator APC apocalypse armored vehicle
On the topic of apocalypse, money is made not only by video game manufacturers, film studios and book publishing houses.
Now automobile companies are developing a new niche for themselves.
Thus, the Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions presented its armored apocalypse Senator APC.
In their spare time, the engineers of this company create armored vehicles for the police.
Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers, which without much comfort, but in full safety are placed in a fully welded armored capsule.
This bunker, or otherwise the design can not be called, as the level of its booking corresponds to the standard B7, is installed on the chassis of a powerful Ford Super Duty pickup.
Its bottom, also armored, is able to protect the capsule from grenades and anti-personnel mines.
Salon of armor of the apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
In order not to harm passengers even an explosive wave from a shell exploded near the car, the cabin of the car is equipped with special shock absorbers.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and fire extinguishing system.
For safe viewing, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a circular view camera system with night vision function, as well as an armored observation tower on the roof.
There are no weapons in the car.
The front part of the salon of the armored apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
To ensure that the weight of the armored vehicle does not affect its mobility, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-strong strong turbo-diesel engine of 6.7 liters, all the power of which is transferred to the four wheels of the armored vehicle through a 6-speed automatic gearbox.
There is no chance to get stuck at all in the armored apocalypse Roshel Senator APC

The term of death of the Universe is announced
The universe will last for another 140 billion years, which is ten times the age of the observed world of about 13.8 billion years.
The study of the international team of scientists is posted in the library of electronic preprints arXiv.org and is aimed at publication in the magazine Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, according to the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Experts came to such conclusions, watching with the help of the HSC camera (Hyper Suprime-Cam) of the Subaru telescope for about ten million galaxies.
After tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 percent of the energy-mass of the observed world, scientists, working under the standard cosmological model CDM (Cold Dark Matter), estimated the rate of expansion of the universe, which was a little slower than previously thought.
In a press release of the Subaru Observatory noted that the observations allowed to obtain a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the Universe, and the accounting of data of the European space telescope Planck specified the restrictions imposed on the parameters of the CDM.
In July, scientists simulated the possible destruction of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues presented new arguments that the observed world would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Great Divide.
So, even if I persuaded you to do something, it is sometimes difficult to get some action as a result.
Everything that exists in the world is only sleep.
Another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum failed
The opportunity to learn the opinion of the people on the pension reform is postponed indefinitely
A meeting of the federal referendum initiative group against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups that registered different formulations of questions (the Central Election Commission registered five formulations in total).
They decided to apply to the CEC with a petition for registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians the question: "Are you in favor of the fact that the age established by the legislation on pension provision as of July 1, 2018, after reaching which Russian citizens receive the right to appoint an old-age pension, does not increase?"
This wording was registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered the simplest and legally capacious.
The majority of participants of the meeting were supporters of a member of "Fair Russia" Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and the Communist Party (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups - from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Earlier, Sviridov told Vedomosti that the invitations were sent to all the initiators, and the consent to come was expressed by representatives of about 40 subgroups.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who heads the Vologda subgroup (its wording was supported by another 15 subgroups), told Vedomosti that she did not receive an invitation and did not plan to come: "We did not understand who is a friend and who is an enemy".

In the match "Loko" - "Akhmat" Turbin's mistakes were poured out as from the horn of abundance
Former judge of the all-Union category Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of referee Evgeny Turbin in the match of the 9th round of the championship of Russia "Locomotive" - "Akhmat" and analyzed the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you assess Evgeny Turbin's refereeing in the match "Locomotive" - "Akhmat"?
- I believe that this referee confirmed his unsuitability for refereeing matches of the Russian Premier League.
I am surprised that the pressure in a meeting of the fifth round of "Spartak" - "Dynamo", neither Turbin, nor heads of DSI didn't make serious conclusions about its low qualification.
The result did not slow down to affect in the ninth round: mistakes in his actions, private omissions of rough receptions were poured out as from the horn of abundance.
For example, in the 50th minute of the railwayman Eder falls with the help of hands in his penalty area defender "Akhmata" Rodolfo.
From the gate eight meters, but Turbin does not put a penalty.
- How do you assess the episode involving Idov, who was at the 82nd minute when it seemed that the ball hit his hand?
"I think there was a deliberate play by the defender's hand in his penalty area.
Turbin was near the moment, well sees the episode and his first assistant on the right.
This moment had to be seen and reserve judge Sergey Karasev.
However, all three slept and the penalty was not assigned.
Therefore the score in the match is distorted, and sports justice was trampled.
It was the case when refereeing by concepts replaced and buried the sports spirit of the game.
- At the 52nd minute Turbin did not dare to remove the defender of guests Oleg Ivanov, who violated the rules in the fight against Kryhovyak, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, demonstratively applauded him.
What do you think about this episode?
It was necessary to show the second "mustard"?
"At this point Turbin and the first yellow card showed not quite on business.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about double standards of refereeing that some teams put a penalty for such violations as in the episode with Idov, and some not.
What do you assess the words of a football player?
- Watching what to understand by double standards.
There was a penalty.
He was not given.
So, the referee does not give a second penalty in the opposite goal.
Here is the principle that is used.
And the second point of double standards is that the judge looks who plays.
Here played on Saturday "Locomotive" and "Akhmat" has serious claims to Turbin's work because the team was infringed.

Matt Damon played accused of rape judge Kavanaugh at the start of SNL
American actor Matt Damon played a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court Brett Cavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first issue of the new season of Saturday Night Live on NBC.
In a small sketch, the actor played Kavanaugh at a hearing in the Senate on charges of rape.
The candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court has previously attracted attention by his emotionality and detail of his stories during a conversation with Senator Amy Klobuchard.
For example, Kavanaugh repeatedly confessed his love for beer, but declared that he had never been drunk to memory.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on charges of rape, Kavanaugh claimed that he was a virgin in those years.
These moments also beat Damon.
I just did that I drank a lot and didn't think about sex at all.
I was the most proud, the most drunken virgin anyone has ever seen.
Everyone is familiar with it ", - said the judge performed by Matt Damon.
Earlier Kavanaugh was elected the Supreme Judge of the United States.
But pay attention to the face and body language of everyone who is present in this fuzzy picture, and you will feel that they are all playing.
But my advice is to tell them that they behaved badly and fled, and apologize.
Nothing, it's a football match, against Afula, we won, although the judge was a Jew.
Barbra Streisand found strangeness in her cloned dogs in behavior
American singer Barbra Streisand said that the clones of her dead dog behave quite differently than the original pet.
"They are not similar.
In fact, [clones] look like her, but it is impossible to clone the soul ", - said the 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old cat de Tulear dog, Samantha, who had to be put to sleep due to health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that a Chihuahua dog named Miracle Milly, named the smallest dog in the world, was cloned for the 49th time.
Specialists are cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
The United States thought about the sea blockade of Russia because of oil and gas supplies
The United States may launch a naval blockade of Russia in order to gain an advantage in the world energy market.
The American authorities have so zealously taken up the fight for success in the world hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to the sea blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world's main suppliers of energy.
U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke told about the possibility of a sea blockade the day before.
Contrary to world practice, the U.S. Department of the Interior does not perform police, but civilian functions, including policy in the field of natural resources.
Therefore, Zinke's statement came quite within the competence of his department, although it was not deprived of political color.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that thanks to the U.S. naval forces, the U.S. controls maritime routes in the Middle East region and can block them if necessary.
It follows from Zinke's words that the need may be related to Washington's desire to prevent Russian supplies to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia still receives the lion's share of its revenues from oil and gas supplies to the world market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motive for Moscow's activation in this region, Zinke said.
The minister made it clear that the United States still expects to secure leadership in the world energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do this, Washington will have to push Russia and Iran, and the naval blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure on this path, Zinke said.
"I have come to tell you that tomorrow I am going to Moscow and will not return to this house again, and you will have news of my decision through a lawyer to whom I will entrust the case of divorce.

Islanders are urged to prick as soon as possible - MK Sakhalin
In the Sakhalin region, a campaign is underway to immunize the population from influenza.
Doctors of the island region urge residents to be more active and not to ignore the recommendations of doctors.

Supersonic passenger aircraft in Russia will be delivered for mass production
Mass production of supersonic passenger aircraft in Russia will begin after 2030.
This was stated by Kirill Sypalo, Director General of the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute named after Zhukovsky.
According to him, the scientific center is working on supersonic topics both within the framework of international consortia and cooperation with the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
"We feel it will take two or three years to get a technology demonstrator, as well as another 10-15 years to get a serial machine that allows transportation through the open spaces of our homeland", added Sypalo.
He said that now Russian specialists face the question of how to make the equipment economical and safe at the same time.
In early September, the developer of aviation equipment PJSC "Tupolev" announced the completion of pre-design works on a supersonic passenger aircraft, according to calculations the aircraft will be able to reach a speed of up to 1900 km / h at an altitude of 11 km.

The expensive violin was handed over to the pawnshop for a pittance
When a man brought a violin to the LBC Boutique and Loan pawnshop in Somerville, Massachusetts, a pawnshop worker offered only $50 for a seemingly old and unpresentable instrument.
But experienced store manager Dylan McDermitt suspected that it was an ancient and expensive tool, and asked for advice from an expert.
It turned out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violin master Ferdinando Galliano and is estimated at 250 thousand dollars.
Only the bond to the violin is estimated at 16-18 thousand dollars.
The investigation revealed that the violin was not so long ago stolen from one of the residents of the city, and the instrument was returned to the rightful owner.
It is not yet known how the violin got to the person who handed it over to the pawnshop, but he is not registered any previous clashes with the law.
The manager says that now all those who bring the violin to the pawnshop will be asked to play it to make sure that it really belongs to the client.

London broke out accusations against Moscow
Russia is trying to rewrite the results of the Cold War, said British Defense Minister Gavin Williamson.
But England will defend its values, he said during a speech at a congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham.
The threat is increasing, Iran and North Korea are becoming more dangerous, enemies are acting in the gray zones with the help of cyber attacks and false news, the minister added.
But the largest of them is Russia, which is increasing its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Such statements of Western politicians Moscow has repeatedly denied, reports TASS.
At the same time, British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt said that Russia will have to pay a high price if it does not adhere to international rules and use chemical weapons.
Hunt mentioned the story of poisoning in the English city of Salisbury in March of this year ex-GRU Colonel Sergey Skripal, convicted of spying for the UK, and his daughter Julia.
In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a referendum on accession to the EU and NATO is held, subject to a change in the name of the country.
The referendum is designed to resolve a 27-year dispute with neighboring Greece over the name of the country, which coincides with the name of the neighboring Greek province.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, an ardent supporter of renaming the republic into northern Macedonia, was one of the first to vote.
The preparations for the referendum and today's voting are monitored by international organizations.
The head of the observation mission of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Jan Petersen, told Euronews how the work of the observers was organized:
Approximately 100 teams have traveled around the country to monitor the whole process today, from the opening of polling stations to their closure, then the counting of votes and the drawing up of protocols.
During the month, 10 of our teams worked in the country to monitor the preparation for voting, the work of the media, the observance of the law on the financing of electoral campaigns and the organization of referendum.
Fai Dulgheri: "About 500 foreign observers closely monitor the voting process.
The teams of observers record in detail what is happening and communicate with the members of the election commissions in order to present them in the final report ".

The translator compared the mentality of Russians and Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but few differences between them do not play a big role for mutual understanding.

"The Germans like to plan events calmly, and the Russians, as the proverb says", harness for a long time, but quickly go ".
But it seems to me that for mutual understanding between peoples and for the work of the translator it does not play a significant role ", - said the expert in a comment" RIA Novosti ".
According to the translator, to understand that the two countries cannot do without each other ", it is enough to know history".

"This is an ugly nepotism"
The audience is outraged by Agutin's choice on the show "Voice"
The audience of the show "Voice 60 +" accused the mentor Leonid Agutin of "ugly nepotism and impudent fraud".
When in blind auditions he learned from the first notes the voice of his father Nikolai Agutin many hoped that he would remain neutral and not turn to the performer.
But son's feelings got the best, and he chose a relative in the team.
Then many considered it a joke, but forgave the instructor bias at the first stage.
But the "joke" lasted, and the father of the star absolutely unjustifiably took the place of more worthy performers.
And now the audience is not ready to forgive Agutin such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the audience of the show, were outraged by nepotism ugly and frank pulling our close relatives to the final ladder.
I already even doubted that Agutin will have enough strength and conscience not to drag to the end his father absolutely already to the first place ", - Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina reasoned in the program" Man from TV ".
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father Leonid Agutin "merged" beautiful performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining it by the fact that the audience still want to see his father in the show.
But, as it turned out, it is not so, the audience wants an objective assessment and see in the final really talented performers, and now Agutin discredited the show.
"I sympathize with the participants of" Golos "from Agutin's team - they were doomed".
"Last time Agutin showed how he loves his father, and today he had to prove to be a professional".
"The contest has lost its meaning".
"To remove two talented people from the project and leave in the project his father who does not sing but whispers, how can you then call a mentor?",
"I like how my father sings, organize a concert in the Kremlin for your money and see how many people will come to this concert".
This is the show "Voice", not the show "Cool relatives".
"On the part of Agutin it was unprofessional".
"Then it is necessary to offer on own show to act the father, instead of on show which is made for money of Channel 1".
"It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad should make me understand more than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why the worker from Surgut with a magnificent voice and timbre merged, and father Agutin brought to the final?
And then we all complain that on stage and from screens the same faces for decades!

Moreover, he said ", Come on, go from here, everything is clear".
Agutin couldn't act as a professional.

In addition, Kovalchuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of nature-like technologies, as well as spoke about the risks that inevitably arise in the creation of such technologies.
"The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, it is a huge benefit.
This is the explosive growth of medical technologies, it is the improvement of the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there is also a second side.
The development of nature-like technologies is actually a technological reproduction of wildlife systems.
There is a downside - purposeful interference in human life.
There are always risks.

Macedonia: Referendum did not take place because of low turnout
The referendum was intended to approve the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country into "Northern Macedonia".
Greece objected to the Macedonian use of the name of its historical province.
The renaming promised the former Yugoslav Republic to open the way to NATO and later to the EU.
But, as EFE reports, only 34% of the turnout at the Sunday plebiscite "did not reach" the constitutional threshold of 50%.
At the same time, since the referendum was only consultative, it is possible that the authorities in Skopje will decide not to refuse to rename.
Speaking shortly after the closure of the polling stations, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a supporter of the change of the name of the republic, said that if there is more "yes" among the votes cast, Macedonia will change its name, despite the unreached quorum.

To press and hold on - how is it right?
There is no word to press.
It is the right thing to do.
The word "press" in the meaning of "pull, influence, influence" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "catch".
We use this word, believing that it comes from the word "pressure".
But "pressure" and "overwhelming" etymologically are not only not close, but even in a sense opposite.
See for yourself.
To suffice (church-book, outdated) means "enough, full, enough, to be sufficient for someone or something, to satisfy".
To be satisfied, pleasure - related words.
Previously, he still had the meaning of "not to depend on anything, to have a self-sufficient meaning" - "to satisfy himself".
The Old Slavonic "dovli" is related to the words "command" and "will".
To press, to suppress - absolutely different.
These words have truly frightening "relatives": daos - "wolf" (pressing sheep), deyja - "die" and dvaidnyh - "oppress".
A similar phonetic appearance of the words "pressure" and "hold", as well as the inevitable obsolescence of the latter, forced them to enter into contamination.
In this way we have got the same "e [a] to fly", which is also used in the letter through "a", which, in a good way, is wrong and impossible from the point of view of the processes of occurrence and development of these words.
So, it is right - to suffocate.
But this word is outdated, in its correct meaning no longer used.
If you want to note that any circumstances / people have a negative impact on you from above, use the word "press".
You can also use the "put pressure" design, but remember that it is an office.

Vučić upheld the highest level of combat readiness of the Serbian army
Serbian President Alexander Vučić ordered to maintain the highest level of combat readiness to which the Armed Forces of the country were brought due to the situation in the north of the autonomous region of Kosovo and Metohija.
"The President ordered to maintain the highest level of combat readiness, its cancellation will be a separate order", - said on Sunday Serbian Defense Minister Alexander Vulin, whose words quoted TASS.
According to him, the head of state is deeply concerned about the events in Kosovo.

Vučić himself said the day before that he intends to discuss the situation in Kosovo and Metohija with Russian President Vladimir Putin and ask the Russian leader for support.
According to available data, the meeting is scheduled for October 2 and is due to take place in Moscow.
At the same time, the Serbian leader stressed that he would do everything to preserve peace and noted that he would like his country to be a peaceful, successful economic, country of the future.

This was done in connection with the visit of Kosovo President Hashim Thaci to the north of the region.

It was after that that the President of Serbia brought the country's armed forces and police special forces to full combat readiness, and also protested to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.

with the help of the operation in Syria, Russia protected itself from terrorists
During the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, about 100 thousand terrorists were killed, of which 85 thousand terrorists were destroyed by the Russian Air and Space Forces.
This was told in connection with the third anniversary of the beginning of the Russian military operation in Syria by the former commander of the Supreme Court, the head of the Federation Council Committee on Defense and Security Viktor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of means of destruction from the air: the Air and Space Forces have delivered and continue to strike all strikes exactly on terrorist targets.
According to Bondarev, in three years tens of thousands of terrorist targets have been destroyed in Syria - for example, ammunition depots, fortifications and headquarters.
With the help of Russian air strikes was hacked the defense of jihadists - it was a decisive contribution to the promotion of the Syrian government troops ", Interfax".
At the same time, according to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria allowed to protect Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two-thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (ISIS, banned in Russia) and Jabhat al-Nusra (banned in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, on the side of ISIS fought about four thousand militants from among Russian citizens and about five thousand citizens of post-Soviet countries, reports TASS.
And we are talking only about registered persons, not counting those who were not identified, said Bondarev.
Most of them were trained and ready to take arms at any moment, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter the territory of our country.
Thus, Bondaryev noted, in Syria Russia is fighting international terrorism on distant borders - otherwise this evil "would flow to us".

Syria accuses the U.S. of supporting terrorism
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem accused the United States and its partners of war crimes in Syria and support for terrorism.
The [Western] coalition completely destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqa, destroyed infrastructure and public services in the areas against which its actions were directed, and carried out mass killings of civilians, including children and women.
These killings under international law are war crimes ", he said.

The Foreign Minister also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria is almost completed, and the country has become more secure and stable.

For example, the management of the group has recently changed again, as well as a large-scale restructuring and fundamental changes in the management system have been announced.
Moreover, Volkswagen promises to buy even new cars if German cities ban diesel engines on their streets: the authorities received this right in February this year.

Metropolitan Hilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename the UOC with the actions of the fascists
The head of the Synodal Department for External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Hilarion, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate into the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the fascists against Jews.
"It's like in fascist Germany to target a Jew with a yellow pointed star, it means to mark the Church as an enemy organization, and it is for this purpose that this bill was created", - said the Metropolitan on the TV channel "Russia-24" (quoted by Interfax).
In his opinion, this step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is in an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to get full control over the UOC and "outlaw it", believes the priest.
"This is a Ukrainian church, and the faithful of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country", he added.
Earlier it became known that the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on the implementation of bills No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter involves renaming the UOC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
When the plan appeared, it was surprisingly simple and straightforward.

Deputy of the Pochaev Lavra called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
The deputy of the Holy Dormition Pochaev Lavra, Metropolitan Vladimir, called for the protection of the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his appeal to the faithful of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was published on Saturday on the website of the monastery.
In different times of history, our predecessors and native Christians in faith and spirit had to confess their faith and defend their holy places.
Taking into account the situation that has developed, and according to the information that we have, and the threats of reprisals, which is spreading, it is clear that we will have to survive something ", - said the Metropolitan.
He asked for support - prayer, moral.
The deputy of the Lavra also stressed that it is likely that "your physical presence will be needed".
The priest added: "Lenin's grandchildren - in spirit, threaten to kill, and therefore we will protect our shrine".
Who does not care about the fate of the Pochaev Lavra - an Orthodox Ukrainian and world shrine, should be ready to protect it, the appeal says.
The Metropolitan urged not to follow the occasion of those who mislead the faithful.
The UOC has the canonical status determined by Tomos of October 29, 1990 from the Mother of the Church.
And now someone wants to become dependent on the newly styled patriarch and friend of the Catholic Pope Bartholomew.
The new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us Orthodox.
And we are satisfied with the status that our church has ", - said the deputy of the Lavra.
He recalled that the UOC since October 1990 is canonically independent and fully independent in its management.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
Actually Tomos our church already has.
What other Tomos do we need? "said Metropolitan Vladimir of Pochaev, urging the faithful and all citizens to ask whether other confessions have Tomos, whether they are independent of the Vatican?
The believers understood to some extent and decided what temple they should go to.
However, someone wants to sow enmity and discord again.
Some people are envious that the domes shine on the temples that they want to destroy ", - said the priest.
Pochaev Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
The Lavra is located on the top of Pochaev Mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopil.
The first historical information about it dates back to the beginning of the XIII century.
In fact, Western cuisine is pretentious.. and such and is.

The main Macedonian opposition refused to vote in the referendum
In Macedonia on Sunday, September 30, a referendum on the intergovernmental treaty with Greece on the renaming of the Republic of Macedonia is held.
Citizens are asked to answer one question: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?"
Nevertheless, the leader of the leading opposition party "Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity" (WMRO-DPMNE), Christian Micko, said that he would not vote in the referendum.
As explained by party spokesman Naum Stoilkovsky, Mitskovsky decided to refrain from voting to express his disagreement with the treaty, which he considers "harmful".
According to the spokesman, the current referendum solves the issue of renaming the country and nothing more, while the strategic goal of the party - to achieve membership in NATO and the EU.
A week ago, Macedonian President Gheorghe Ivanov also refused to participate in the referendum on September 30.
He explained that he chose the name for the country 27 years ago in a referendum on independence.
"A new semi-sovereign state with a new name is being created", Ivanov said.
The agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic - the Republic of Northern Macedonia - was signed by the Foreign Ministers of Macedonia and Greece on June 17 this year during a solemn ceremony on the shore of Lake Presa, which runs the border between the two countries.
This treaty should resolve a long-term dispute about the name of the country, as well as Skopje's way to NATO and the EU, recalls TASS.

At the same time, the Czech Foreign Ministry said that only two Czech tourists were injured.
According to the diplomatic department, the injured woman recorded burns on 35% of the body, the man - 15%, writes "RIA Novosti".
In this case, it is about burns of the second degree, and in a woman - with deep penetration into the structure of the skin.
Turkish cook Nusret Gekce is known on the Internet for its exquisite way to sprinkle steaks with salt and spices.
It was reported that he had ordered a large-scale PR campaign in various countries, during which Leonardo DiCaprio visited the Nusreta restaurant in Dubai.

This was reported on September 30 by the press service of the European Commission.
In order to monitor the provision of assistance, the European Commission has sent its experts to the region.
As noted, the funds will be used for disinfection, as well as providing the victims with food, water, temporary shelters and medicines.
The Commission also granted the Indonesian authorities access to the satellite maps of the European Emergency Service Copernicus (Copernicus) to assess the damage.
The United States also expressed its readiness to assist in the elimination of the consequences of the natural disaster, said in a statement issued by the head of the press service of the U.S. Department of State Heather Nauert.

U.S. satisfied with the growth of opiate production in Afghanistan
The sharp aggravation of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26 was much discussed in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations with the participation of Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, which was represented by Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, in the Afghan territory militants unleashed a real terrorist war against the state authorities and the civilian population of the country.
This year was a record year in the number of bloody terrorist attacks, which killed thousands of ordinary Afghans ", - said Patrushev.
Afghanistan's woes did not start yesterday.
After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the main enemy of the United States was the terrorist group al-Qaeda (banned in the Russian Federation), which settled in Afghanistan.
Less than a month later, America and NATO allies launched an "Enduring Freedom" military operation there.
17 years have passed.
Thousands of American troops are still on Afghan soil.
And peaceful life is even more ghostly than it was then.
American troops are driven behind the fences of dozens of their bases.
As they can, they buy off the militants for money - if only they are not touched.
The Afghan government controls a smaller part of the country's territory - 40%, according to Patrushev.
50% - the Taliban movement (banned in the Russian Federation).
Another 10% - for ISIS terrorists (banned in the Russian Federation).
But they are growing fast there.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia - exactly what they failed in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be satisfied with it.
It is also gratifying that during the 17 years of the American presence, the production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased by at least 40 times.
A huge increase in the area sown with opium poppy and multi-billion profits.

The Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on accession to the EU and NATO, provided the name of the country changes.
The agreement on renaming the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia into the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on June 17 as a result of long negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize its northern neighbor the right to be called Macedonia, considering in this name an attempt on the Greek province of the same name and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovsky, political scientist: "Thanks to this agreement Macedonia or Northern Macedonia gets the right to a better future, hope for social change.
And Greece will consolidate its right to its past.
There are no ideal agreements.
They are the result of difficult compromises that cannot make everyone happy ".
The ruling Social Democrats, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, are in favor of renaming the country.
Against - conservative opposition and President Gheorghe Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetina Chilimanov, Macedonia does not make sense to join the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with it: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government led by Zaev is imposed from outside in order to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
It is obvious that there are countries that do not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans ".
Fay Dulgheri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the biggest challenge in its history.
The country is at a crossroads.
The choice made by the citizens of Macedonia will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but of Europe as a whole ".

Peskov answered a question about possible support for Serbia on Kosovo
Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for the Russian President, believes that it is premature to talk about whether Russia will provide assistance to Serbia after the escalation in Kosovo.
According to him, first negotiations between the leaders of the two countries should be held.
This was told by a representative of the Kremlin to journalists of the radio station "Moscow says" on Sunday, September 30.
On September 29, Serbian resident Alexander Vučić said that he intends to discuss the situation in Kosovo with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the next meeting in Moscow on October 2.
The Serbian leader also planned to ask for Moscow's support in the current situation, specifying that military assistance in this case is not a question.
Vučić noted that he would like to preserve peace in the region and intends to do everything necessary for this.
Earlier that day it became known that the President of Serbia ordered to bring the country's armed forces to a state of highest combat readiness.
