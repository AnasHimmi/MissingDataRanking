Named the number of preparing to send to Donbass recruits from Ukraine
The official representative of the people's militia of the self-proclaimed Luhansk people's Republic (LNR) Andrey Marochko declared that in the winter of 2018-2019 Ukraine will send to Donbass not less than 3 thousand recruits.

"The reluctance of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the armed forces of Ukraine, mass layoffs have led to low staffing units," - said Marochko, quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that the real numbers of Ukrainians drafted into the army can be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched the so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by the operation of the United forces (OOS).
It was assumed that this measure will strengthen the role of Ukrainian security forces in the settlement of the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbass escalated due to the murder of the head of the DPR Alexander Zakharchenko.
The DPR authorities qualified the incident as a terrorist attack.
During the investigation of the criminal case, several people involved in the explosion were detained.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the diversion was organized by the Ukrainian special services.

Telegram users complained about the failure of the new version
IPhone users have complained about the problems in the telegram messenger after the update released on September 28.
The user's phone number can be found by its user name
Complaints relate to gadgets with the current operating system iOS 12.
According to their owners, after the update the app shows a white screen or immediately closes.
Representatives of the messenger responded to the failure.
According to them, the problem may be related to the migration of information to a new application written in Swift.
Telegram temporarily suspended the automatic update of the app until the issue was resolved.
On April 13, the Tagansky court of Moscow granted Roskomnadzor's claim to block the Telegram messenger in Russia.
Three days later, the operators began to implement the decision.
The reason was the refusal of the administration of the messenger to provide the FSB with the keys to decrypt the correspondence necessary to obtain data about terrorists.
In August, Telegram changed its privacy policy and agreed to disclose the IP address and mobile phone number of a suspected terrorist user upon receipt of a court decision.
Telegram audience after blocking in Russia decreased by 1.2 million

Elon Musk forced to leave the post of head of the Board of Directors of Tesla
The Commission on securities and stock exchanges of the USA and founder of Tesla Elon Musk has settled a dispute in case of fraud.
It is reported by CNBC News.
According to the channel, as part of the agreements Mask will have to leave the post of head of the Board of Directors of Tesla.
In this case, the Commission allowed the Mask to retain the post of head of Tesla.
As noted, the founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
A similar amount will be collected from Tesla.
At the same time, the money will be distributed among the affected investors.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent Directors.
Elon Musk - American entrepreneur, included in the list of 50 richest people in the world according to Forbes magazine.
He is the head of SpaceX space Corporation, Neurotechnology company Neuralink and Tesla electric car developer, as well as the co-founder of Paypal.
The Commission on securities and stock exchanges of the USA has previously filed a lawsuit against the CEO of Tesla Elon musk because of his messages posted on Twitter, about a possible buyout of the company.
Last month, Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy all shares on the stock exchange at a fixed price of $420.
The value of the stock in the $420 was installed supposedly "because of the significance of this number in the culture of marijuana", previously reported Bloomberg citing the co-Director of the security Department of the Commission Stephen Pacina.
At the same time, Elon Musk subsequently abandoned his plans to buy back the shares.
Commenting on the lawsuit filed against him by the securities and exchange Commission, the businessman said that he considers the charges of fraud unfounded, and added that he was very disappointed and saddened by these claims.
"Honesty is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I did not violate it in any way," the businessman said in an interview with CNBC.
In August, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a class action against Musk, complaining of financial losses.
The plaintiffs claimed that the businessman's posts had caused them losses.
In particular, one of the shareholders said that the businessman's tweets were misleading, which is why the sellers of Tesla shares were forced to buy securities at artificially inflated prices to cover their positions.
Other plaintiffs also noted that the careless statements of Elon Musk led to sharp fluctuations in the course.
In September, Elon Musk accused the head of the research company Citron Research of exchange fraud.
Meanwhile, if the Mask failed to resolve their dispute with the Commission on securities and stock exchanges of the USA, he could face a suspension from the company and even prison.
This, in particular, said CNBC former Chairman of the Commission Harvey pitt.

Trump spoke about the "love" in Kim Jong-UN
From mutual cruelty, the leaders of the United States and North Korea came almost to falling in love with each other, Donald trump joked.
The President of the United States Donald trump scored a good joke about their successes at the front the settlement of the North Korean crisis.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, now the leaders of the two countries have straightened relations so much that they are almost in love with each other, the American President said.
The owner of the White house recalled that he accepted the North Korean problem from the previous administration as the main difficulty in foreign policy.
Trump noted that Barack Obama's team so launched relations with the DPRK that it could not even get through to the country's leadership - they simply did not pick up the phone.
Then the US and North Korea were on the verge of war, and today the North Korean leader writes to the White house "beautiful letters", trump said.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work, too, "was cruel" to Kim Jong-UN, which, however, was mutual.
However, now their relationship has straightened to such an extent that the leaders "fell in love with each other."
At the same time, trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the American media would interpret them as incompetence.
Trump drew attention to the fact that recently Pyongyang has stopped nuclear and missile tests, as well as closes military ranges.
All this is the merit of the work of his administration, the American President is sure.
Last Tuesday, Donald trump flattered Kim Jong-UN from the UN General Assembly rostrum.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for his courage and steps taken to de-escalate tensions.
At the same time, trump noted that sanctions against the DPRK will remain until the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
Negotiations in Singapore
On June 12, Singapore hosted the first-ever talks between the leaders of the United States and North Korea.
After a serious deterioration of relations and mutual threats of the use of nuclear weapons, the summit looked like a turning point in the protracted us-Korean crisis.
Following the talks, the parties expressed their intention to move towards a peaceful resolution of the contradictions, although they did not assume any legal obligations.
The positive results of the meeting were the cessation of nuclear and missile tests of the DPRK, as well as the return to the US of the remains of American soldiers who were in the country.
At the same time, other practical steps towards denuclearization of North Korea are stalled.
The media reported that after the Singapore summit, the US sent North Korea several scenarios for disarmament, but Pyongyang rejected them, calling them "gangster".

Nicoll urged to push "Moscow language of the Ukrainian product"
Ukrainian children's writer and fighter for the purity of the native language Larisa Nice called to oust from Ukraine "Russian-speaking Moscow product and the Moscow language."
It offers to do this by the Ukrainian product - "cultural wave, cultural onslaught".
Sica shared her thoughts on the "expediency of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine" with the Ukrainian edition of "Obozrevatel".
According to her, the corresponding Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it even already exists and continues to develop further.
Over time, Ukrainians will "recover" from this "Moscow language", she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, according to her, earlier on television and radio Russian speech was widely used, but in the public space it is almost gone.
At the same time, according to Nice, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, are only "an extension of the boundaries for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level."
Earlier, She shared her experience of maintaining the "Ukrainian-language regime" in a children's camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened to sue a network of bookstores Watsons, the cashier of one of which communicated with her in Russian.
Not succeeding, Nicoll threw in the girl delivery.
She calls the use of Russian words by Ukrainians "language schizophrenia", urging Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in writing surnames.
Recently, Nice said that the name "Rus" was stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Muscovy.
The writer's anger could not be avoided even by the security Service of Ukraine: having come there and heard the conversations of employees with each other in Russian, she caused a scandal and left, slamming the door.

Serbian President wants to ask Putin for support
Serbian President Alexander Vucic will discuss with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin the situation with Kosovo and ask for his support during the meeting in Moscow.
Serbian President Alexander Vucic will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.
During the meeting, he plans to discuss with a colleague from Russia the current situation with Kosovo.
In addition, Vucic intends to ask Putin for support.
The corresponding statement was made by the Serbian leader during a press conference, the local newspaper "Evening news".
According to the source, the head of Serbia said that, speaking of the need for support from the Russian side, he does not mean military support for the example of Syria.
Alexander Vucic said that he did not want to allow the scenario in which the territory of the state can happen any major military clashes.
The President of the country promised to make every effort to preserve peace, the newspaper reports.
We will add that according to the Serbian media, the meeting of the heads of Russia and Serbia is scheduled for the upcoming Tuesday, October 2, writes "Lenta.ru."
The day before it became known that the Serbian President led the army of the state in full combat readiness because of the situation with Kosovo.
We are talking about the events of last Friday, when several dozen special forces of Kosovo entered the territory, which is adjacent to the lake, supplying water to the hydroelectric power station "Gazivode".
It is specified that the specified HPP is located in the territory of Kosovo, but at the same time belongs to the Serbian power system.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly the theme of Russia in a negative way was practically absent
The head of the Federation Council Committee on international Affairs Konstantin Kosachev considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly successful for Russia and does not exclude that it can be a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in solving global problems.
"The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric, to which we have almost become accustomed in recent years in relation to Russia, was now much more muted," - said the Senator in an interview published on Sunday "Rossiyskaya Gazeta".
He explained that in previous years, the Russian Federation was sometimes "designated as one of the three main threats to humanity, along with Ebola, along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this series, at least, in the statement of the group of Western countries, which in this regard was expressed quite unanimously".
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed, "the theme of Russia in a negative way was practically absent."
"If you carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the Minister of foreign Affairs of Germany, I now do not take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, the choir was not exactly" - drew the attention of the politician, noting that Russia "was no longer a kind of wall, which is trained tennis ball strikes."
The head of the relevant Committee of the Federation Council does not exclude that this indicates a certain trend, which, in his opinion, "will highlight the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although this trend may fully manifest itself in a year, two, three."
"I do not exclude that the current session in some sense can be a turning point," Kosachev admitted, explaining that "there are too many examples of how Russia manages to move forward in international Affairs with the connection."
As an example, he cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"Unfortunately, this is not Ukraine yet, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time," the parliamentarian added.
This is due to the fact, he believes, that there is "an adequate, sound perception of Russia as not just a possible - an integral participant in the solution of global problems of our time."
"I would not like to make a mistake, but I have a feeling that we are somewhere passing the point where the movement will not be a movement backwards, it will be a movement forward," he added.
Another "interesting and important feeling" in this context, Kosachev called "a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop."
"I attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly], foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I was very pleased to see that if a year or two or five years ago, Russian opinion, Russian vision of what is happening in the world, by and large, no one was interested, now the situation is different," - said the Chairman of the Federation Council Committee.
In his opinion, this is due to the fact that "the so-called new liberal order, which is personified with the West, has no answers to the questions of how to solve the world's problems due to the obvious lack of ideas in the global space, lack of ideas on how to solve the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problem of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the problem of migration."
"And here the request for the Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious," Kosachev expressed confidence, stressing that he believes in this sense, "the current session is successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia."

ADH became the second most popular in Germany
Anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" beats another record of popularity, and the ratings of Angela Merkel fall.
Apparently, the people of Germany began to get seriously tired of the immigration policy of Angela Merkel, thanks to which the country has become a coveted target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
Most clearly this is evidenced by the latest polls, according to which the anti-immigrant party "Alternative for Germany" is becoming more popular, and the positions of the ruling bloc Merkel and Seehofer are weakening.
This week, ADH broke another record, rising to the second place in the ranking of people's sympathies.
Right-wing conservatives with 17 percent of popularity managed to bypass the social Democrats, who have about 16 percent.
The gap of one percentage point can be attributed to a statistical error, but it should be noted that the ADG created in 2013 from a small group of eurosceptic economists managed to turn into a serious political force.
Leadership in the overall standings continues to hold the ruling bloc of the CSU/CDU, which has about 30 percent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points - in April, the support of Angela Merkel's bloc was four percentage points higher.
Reduced and personal rating of the German Chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term.
Today, in support of Angela Merkel are 48 percent of Germans, which is 7 percent lower than last year.
We add that after the social Democrats are "green" (15%), the left (11%) and the liberals (10%).
Evolution "Alternatives"
The alternative for Germany party was established in September 2012 on the basis of the alternative choice 2013 group, which included people from the Christian democratic Union.
The group initially opposed the government's course, but initially dealt only with economic issues, including the problems of the Euro and cooperation within the EU.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany's "sponsorship" of the weak economies of the EU, did not exclude the possibility of a return to the German mark and a full exit of the country from the European Union.
Amid deepening immigration crisis, the political platform of ADG has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full-fledged party, which took a niche of eurosceptics and began to harshly criticize the government for the failure of immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, ADH managed to break into the Bundestag for the first time, receiving 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of the "Alternative for Germany" get a seat in the European Parliament.

Named the time of death of the Universe
The universe will exist for another 140 billion years, ten times the age of the observed world, which is about 13.8 billion years.
The study of the international team of scientists posted in the library of electronic preprints arXiv.org and aimed at publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, according to the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
To such conclusions, experts have come, watching with the camera HSC (Hyper Supreme-Cam) telescope Subaru for about ten million galaxies.
By tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 percent of the energy-the mass of the observed world, scientists working within the standard cosmological model ŒõCDM (Œõ Cold Dark Matter), estimated the rate of expansion of the Universe, which was a little slower than previously thought.
In a press release of the Subaru Observatory it is noted that the observations made it possible to obtain a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the Universe, and the data of the European space telescope Planck specified the restrictions imposed on the parameters ŒõCDM.
In July, scientists simulated the possible death of the Universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new arguments that the observed world would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of a Large gap.
Now, even if I could convince you to do something, sometimes it's hard to get any action out of it.

Another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum failed
The opportunity to learn the opinion of the people about the pension reform is postponed indefinitely
A meeting of the Federal initiative group of the referendum against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups that registered different formulations of questions (in total, the Central election Commission registered five formulations).
They decided to apply to the CEC with a request for registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians the question: "are You for the fact that the age established by the legislation on pension provision as of July 1, 2018, at which Russian citizens are entitled to an old-age pension, is not increased?"
This formulation was registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered the simplest and legally capacious.
The majority of the meeting participants were supporters of Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and the Communist party (four subgroups), a member of Just Russia.
They were joined by three independent subgroups - from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Earlier he told "Vedomosti" that the invitation was sent to all initiators, and agreeing to come was expressed by the representatives of about 40 groups.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, the head of the Vologda subgroup (its formulation was supported by another 15 subgroups), told Vedomosti that she did not receive an invitation and did not plan to come: "We did not understand who was a friend and who was an enemy."

In a match "Loko" - "Ahmad" error Turbine fell like a horn of plenty
The former judge of the all-Union category Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of the referee Evgeny Turbin in the match of the 9th round of the Russian championship Lokomotiv - Akhmat and reviewed the controversial episodes of the game.
- How can you estimate refereeing Eugene Turbine in the match "Lokomotiv" - "Ahmad"?
- I believe that this referee has confirmed his unfitness for judging the matches of the Russian Premier League.
I am surprised that the pressure in the meeting of the fifth round of "Spartak" - "Dynamo", neither Turbin nor the leaders of the DSI did not make serious conclusions about his low qualification.
The result was not slow to affect in the ninth round: errors in his actions, private omissions of rough receptions fell as from a cornucopia.
For example, at the 50th minute of the railroad Eder floods with his hands in his own penalty area, the defender "Akhmad" ELISA.
From the gate of eight meters, but Turbine doesn't award a penalty.
- How do you assess the episode with Idov, who was on the 82nd minute, when it seemed that the ball hit him in the hand?
- I believe that there was a deliberate play by the defender's hand in his penalty area.
Turbin was near the moment, well sees this episode and his first assistant on the right.
This moment had to be seen also by the reserve judge Sergey Karasev.
However, all three of them slept, and the penalty was not awarded.
Therefore, the score in the match is distorted, and sports justice was trampled.
This was the case when judging by the concepts supplanted and buried the sports spirit of the game.
- In the 52nd minute, Turbine decided not to remove the defender of the guests, Oleg Ivanov, who broke the rules in the fight against Krychowiak, and when the referee showed him a yellow card and demonstratively applauded him.
What do you think about this episode?
It was necessary to show the second yellow card?
- At this point the Turbines and the first yellow card shown is not quite the case.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about the double standards of refereeing that some teams get a penalty for such violations as in the episode with Idov, and some do not.
What do you evaluate the words of a football player?
- Depends what you mean by double standards.
There was a penalty.
They didn't.
So, the referee does not give a second penalty to the opposite goal.
Here is the principle that is used.
And the second point of the double standards that the judge looks at who's playing.
Played here on Saturday "the locomotive" and "Ahmad" there are serious claims to work of the Turbine, because the team was slighted.
- The man changed sex, became a lesbian. Just a minute.
To his great joy, his team won the game.

Matt Damon played accused of rape judge Cavanaugh at the start of SNL
American actor Matt Damon played us Supreme court candidate Brett Cavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first issue of the new season of Saturday Night Live on NBC.
During a small sketch, the actor played Cavanaugh at a Senate hearing on rape charges.
Candidate to the US Supreme court has previously attracted attention with its emotion and detail in his stories during the conversation with Senator Amy Klobuchar.
Thus, Cavanaugh has repeatedly admitted his love of beer, but said that he had never drunk to unconsciousness.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on charges of rape, Cavanaugh claimed that he was a virgin in those years.
These moments also beat Damon.
All I did was drink a lot and not think about sex at all.
I was the proudest, drunkest virgin anyone had ever seen.
Everyone knows it," said the judge in the performance of Matt Damon.
Previously, Cavanaugh was elected chief judge of the United States.
But pay attention to the face and body language of everyone who is present in this fuzzy picture, and you will feel that they are all playing.
But my advice to you is to tell them you've been misbehaving and run away, and apologize.
Nothing, it's a football game, against Afula, we won, although the judge was Jewish.
Barbra Streisand found her cloned dogs strange behavior
American singer Barbra Streisand said that clones of her dead dog behave quite differently than the original pet.
"They don't.
In fact, [the clones] look like her, but it is impossible to clone the soul," - said the 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old Coton de tulear dog named Samantha, who had to be put to sleep because of health problems.
In July 2018,it was reported that the dog breed Chihuahua named Miracle Milli (Miracle Milly), which was called the smallest dog in the world, cloned for the 49th time.
Experts are engaged in cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so tiny.
The US thought about the naval blockade of Russia because of oil and gas supplies
The United States may begin a naval blockade of Russia to gain an advantage in the global energy market.
The American authorities are so zealously engaged in the struggle for success in the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to the naval blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world's main suppliers of energy.
On the possibility of a naval blockade on the eve told the interior Minister Ryan Zinke.
Contrary to world practice, the American Ministry of the interior does not perform police and civil functions, including the implementation of policies in the field of natural resources.
Therefore, Zinke's statement came quite within the competence of the Department headed by him, although it was not devoid of political overtones.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that thanks to the naval forces of the United States control sea routes in the middle East region and can block them if necessary.
From zinke's words it followed that the need may be related to Washington's desire to prevent Russian supplies to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia still receives the lion's share of its revenues from the supply of oil and gas to the world market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motive for Moscow's activation in this region, Zinke is sure.
The Minister made it clear that the US still expects to secure leadership in the global energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do this, Washington will have to oust Russia and Iran, and the sea blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure on this path, zinke believes.
-"I have come to tell you that I am leaving for Moscow tomorrow and will not return to this house again, and you will have news of my decision through the lawyer to whom I will entrust the divorce case.

Expensive violin was pawned for a song
When a man brought a violin to the LBC Boutique and Loan pawnshop in Somerville, Massachusetts, a pawnshop worker offered only $ 50 for an old-looking and unpresentable instrument.
But an experienced store Manager Dylan Mcdermitt suspected that this is an old and expensive tool, and asked for advice from an expert.
Then it turned out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violin master Ferdinando Galliano and is estimated at 250 thousand dollars.
Only bows the violin is estimated at 16-18 thousand dollars.
The investigation revealed that the violin was not so long ago stolen from one of the city's residents, and the tool returned to the rightful owner.
It is not yet known how the violin came to the person who pawned it, but it is not listed any previous clashes with the law.
The Manager says that now all those who bring the violin to the pawnshop will be asked to play it to make sure that it really belongs to the client.

The red-whites now have a difficult streak: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the Europa League the team of Massimo Carrera unexpectedly flew to rapid, and recently lost to Akhmat at home.
After the Derby with CSKA, which ended in a fair draw, "Spartak" with a minimum score and not without difficulty beat in the Cup "Chernomorets", and it is too early to say whether the most popular club in Russia has approached the exit from the crisis.
"Rostov" three matches in a row could not win, but does not know defeats for five matches.
Let's see if Karpin will be able to extend the win-win series in such a fundamental match for himself.

About international translation day, 30 September, told a professional conference interpreter B√§rbel sax.
She has been translating from Russian and English for more than 30 years.
"The Germans love easily plan events, and Russian, as the saying goes, "long harness, but ride fast".
But it seems to me, for mutual understanding between the peoples and for the work of the translator it does not play a significant role," - said the expert in the comment "RIA Novosti".
According to the translator, to understand that the two countries can not do without each other, "it is enough to know the history."

"This is an ugly nepotism"
The audience are outraged by the selection yesterday on the show "the Voice"
The audience of the show "Voice 60+" accuse mentor Leonid Agutin of "ugly nepotism and brazen fraud."
When in the blind auditions he learned from the first notes the voice of his father Nikolai Agutin, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not turn to the performer.
But FILIAL feelings took the upper hand, and he chose a relative in his team.
Then many considered it a joke, but forgave the mentor bias in the first stage.
But the "joke" was delayed, and the father of the star is absolutely unjustifiably took the place of more worthy performers.
And now the audience is not ready to forgive Agutina such injustice.
Yesterday we, the audience of the show, were outraged by nepotism ugly and Frank dragging their close relatives to the final ladder.
I even doubted that Agutin will have the strength and conscience not to drag to the end of his father is already in the first place," - said Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina in the program "the Man from the TV."
Meanwhile, for the sake of the father Leonid Agutin "merged" fine performers who really sang while Nikolay Petrovich whispered a touching song about mother, having explained it that the audience wants to see his father in show further.
But, as it turned out, this is not so, viewers want an objective assessment and to see in the final indeed talented performers, and now Agutin discredited show.
"I sympathize with the participants of the "Voice" of the team Agutin - they were doomed."
"Last time Agutin showed how much he loves dad, and today he had to show himself as a professional."
"The contest has lost its meaning."
"To remove two talented people from the project and leave in the project his father who does not sing but whispers, how can you call a mentor after that?",
"Like the way dad sings, give him a concert in the Kremlin for your money and see how many people come to this concert."
This show "the Voice" and not show "Cool relatives".
"By yesterday it was unprofessional."
"Then we have their own TV show to offer to speak to the Pope, and not on a show that is done for the money 1 Channel".
"It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad should cause me to understand more than any other participant with real vocal abilities.
Why worker from Surgut with a great voice and timbre merged, and Pope Agutin brought to the final?
And then we all complain about the same faces on stage and on screen for decades!

Then the meter never came to take the son in his own team.
More than that, he said, "Come on, get out of here, all right."
Agutin could not act as a professional.

Carrera's actions were completely absurd.
To pay attention to such things is utter stupidity.

This is the explosive growth of medical technologies, improving the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there is a second side.
The development of technologies that resemble natural ones in fact there is a technological reproduction of the systems of nature.
There is a downside - purposeful intervention in human activity.
There are always risks.
There was a car - people began to die under the wheels.
But cars are still used.
The dual nature of the technology immediately.
I create a new medical technology, and at the same time can create weapons of mass destruction", - quotes the scientist REN TV.

Macedonia: referendum did not take place due to low turnout
The referendum was called to approve the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country "Northern Macedonia".
Greece objected to the Macedonians using the name of their historical province.
The renaming promised the former Yugoslav Republic an opening to NATO and later to the EU.
But, according to the Agency EFE, only 34% of the turnout on Sunday's plebiscite "did not reach" the constitutional threshold of 50%.
However, since the referendum was only of a consultative nature, the authorities in Skopje may decide not to abandon the renaming.
Speaking shortly after the closure of the polling stations, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, a supporter of the change of name of the Republic, said that if there were more "Yes" among the votes cast, Macedonia would change the name, despite the unachieved quorum.

For people outraged by a flock of sheep in the cemetery
On September 30 on the known Kemerovo page on a social network there was a message from the eyewitness that on one of local cemeteries horned animals freely walk about.
Animals a considerable herd walked between the fence and plucked the grass.
Commentators expressed different opinions: some of the locals noted that in the presence of small cattle in the cemetery there is no harm, and their appetite can even help in clearing the area of weeds and grass, but some of the residents of the animal behavior did not have to like:
"These are graves , not pasture.
Sheep have nothing to do there.
About sheep, of course you will not say that they blaspheme, but still it is not the case." (style is kept) - the indignant Kemerovo woman noted in the message.
Anyway, someone from eyewitnesses noted that about a problem in the form of animals in the middle of a cemetery it is already known, and soon necessary measures will be taken.

Press and dominate - how right?
There is no word for pressure.
Right - to cling to.
The word "press" in the sense of "to weigh, to influence, to influence" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "to dominate".
We use this word, believing that it comes from the word "pressure".
But "pressure" and "dominate" etymologically are not only not close, but even in some sense opposite.
See for yourself.
To dominate (Church.-bookish, outdated) - means "enough, full, enough, to be sufficient for someone or something to satisfy."
To be content, pleasure - related words.
Previously, it still had the meaning of "do not depend on anything, have a self-sufficient value" - "to dominate yourself."
Old Church Slavonic "doville" related words "command" and "will".
Press, suppress - completely different.
These words are really frightening "relatives": daos - "wolf" (crushing sheep), deyja - "die" and dvaidƒ´ - "oppress".
The similar phonetic appearance of the words "pressure" and "dominate", as well as the inevitable obsolescence of the latter, forced them to enter into contamination.
So we have this very "d[a]vlet", which is used in writing through "a", which, in a good way, wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of occurrence and development of these words.
So, the right - to cling to.
But this word is outdated, in its correct meaning is no longer used.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people have a negative impact on you from above, use the word "push".
You can also use the "apply pressure" design, but remember that this is a stationery.

with the operation in Syria, Russia has protected itself from terrorists
For three years of the Russian military operation in Syria killed about 100 thousand terrorists, 85 thousand of them terrorists destroyed the Aerospace forces of the Russian Federation.
This was said in connection with the third anniversary of the Russian military operation in Syria, the former commander of the aerospace forces, head of the Federation Council Committee on defense and security Viktor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of application of means of destruction from the air: Air and space power applied and continue to apply the blows accurately at the targets of the terrorists.
According to Bondarev, for three years in Syria destroyed tens of thousands of terrorist targets - we are talking, for example, ammunition depots, fortifications and headquarters.
With the help of Russian air strikes, the defense of jihadists was hacked - this was a decisive contribution to the promotion of Syrian government troops, Interfax reports.
At the same time, according to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria allowed to protect Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two-thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic state (is, banned in Russia) and Jabhat al-Nusra (banned in Russia).
According to the General staff of the Armed forces of the Russian Federation, on the side of the IG fought about four thousand fighters from among the Russian citizens, and about five thousand citizens of post-Soviet countries, reports TASS.
And we are talking only about the recorded persons, not counting those who have not been identified, said Bondarev.
Most of them were trained and ready to take up arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter the territory of our country.
Thus, Bondarev noted, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism on distant borders - otherwise this evil would "rush to us."

Metropolitan Hilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename the UOC with the actions of fascists
The head of the Synodal Department for external Church relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Hilarion, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists against Jews.
"It's like in Nazi Germany to put a yellow pointed star on a Jew, it means to mark the Church as an enemy organization, and for this purpose this bill was created," the Metropolitan said on the TV channel "Russia-24" (quote from "Interfax").
In his opinion, this step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is in an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to gain full control over the UOC and "put it outside the law," the priest believes.
"This is the Ukrainian Church, and the believers of this Church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country," he added.
Earlier it became known that the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on the implementation of bills ‚Ññ4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), ‚Ññ4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and ‚Ññ5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter implies renaming the UOC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
When the plan came up, it was surprisingly simple and straightforward.
We need to get past the sensor network and avoid the Dominion patrols. I know.

The Governor of the Pochaev Lavra called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
Metropolitan Volodymyr, Deputy of the Holy Dormition Lavra of Pochaev, made an appeal to protect the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his address to the believers of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was published on Saturday on the website of the monastery.
At different times in the history of our predecessors and relatives by faith and spirit Christians had to confess their faith and defend their shrines.
Given the situation that has developed, and according to the information that we have, and the threats of violence, which is spreading, it is clear that we will have to go through something," - said the Metropolitan.
He asked for support - prayerful, moral.
Also, the vicar said that probably "need your physical presence."
The priest added: "Lenin's grandchildren - in spirit, threaten with violence, and therefore protect their Shrine."
Who cares about the fate of the Pochaev Lavra - Orthodox Ukrainian and world shrines, we must be ready to protect it, the address says.
Metropolitan urged not to go on about those who mislead believers.
The UOC has a canonical status determined by Tomos on October 29, 1990 from the Mother Church.
And now someone wants to make dependent on the news Patriarch and a friend of the Catholic Pope Bartholomew.
The new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us Orthodox.
And we are satisfied with the status that our Church has," said the vicar of the Lavra.
He recalled that the UOC has been canonically independent and fully independent in its management since October 1990.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, our Church already has Tomos.
What other Tomos do we need?"- said Metropolitan Vladimir of Pochaev, calling the faithful and all citizens to wonder whether other religions Tomos, whether they are independent from the Vatican?
Believers in some measure understood and decided in what temple they go.
However, someone wants to sow enmity and discord again.
Some are seized with envy that Shine domes on the temples that they want to destroy," - said the priest.
Pochaev Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
Lavra is located on the top of Pochaev mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopil.
The first historical information about it dates back to the beginning of the XIII century.
Actually, Western cuisine is pretentious... and this is.

U.S. satisfied with the growth of opiate production in Afghanistan
Tehran talked a lot about the sharp aggravation of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26.
There were multilateral consultations with Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, represented by security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, in Afghan territory, the militants unleashed a real terrorist war against the state authorities and the civilian population of the country.
This year was a record in the number of bloody terrorist attacks, which killed thousands of ordinary Afghans," Patrushev said.
The troubles in Afghanistan did not start yesterday.
After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the main enemy of the United States was declared a terrorist group "al-Qaeda" (banned in Russia), entrenched in Afghanistan.
Less than a month, as America and NATO allies began there military operation "enduring freedom".
It's been 17 years.
Thousands of American troops are still on Afghan soil.
And peaceful life is even more ghostly than it was then.
American troops are driven behind the fences of dozens of their bases.
As can, pay off fighters for money - if only they weren't touched.
The government of Afghanistan controls a smaller part of the country - 40%, according to Patrushev.
50% - the Taliban (banned in Russia).
Another 10% - for ISIS terrorists (banned in Russia).
But they grow fast there.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-Caliphate in Central Asia - exactly the one that they failed in Iraq and Syria.
America, apparently, is satisfied.
How happy that in 17 years the American presence and the production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased by at least 40 times.
Huge growth of the areas sown with opium poppy and multibillion-dollar profits.

Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on joining the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the name of the country.
The agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on 17 June as a result of long negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize its Northern neighbor's right to be called Macedonia, seeing in this name an attempt on the Greek province of the same name and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovsky, political scientist: "Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or Northern Macedonia gets the right to a better future, hope for social change.
And Greece will consolidate the right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They arise as a result of a difficult compromise can not bring happiness to absolutely everyone."
For renaming the country are the ruling social Democrats, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
Against - the conservative opposition and President George Ivanov.
According to the journalist Cvetin Filimonova, Macedonia makes no sense to join the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with him: "Many of those who do not like the agreement, believe that the current socialist government headed by Sevim imposed from the outside to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
Obviously, there are countries that would not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans."
