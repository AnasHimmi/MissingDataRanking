The number of newlyweds from Ukraine preparing to be sent to Donbass is named
The official representative of the People's Militia of the self - proclaimed Lugan People's Republic (DOJ), Andrey Maročko, said that in the winter of 2018 - 2019, Ukraine would send at least 3,000 new recruits to Donbass.
He said Kiev was therefore planning to "get the units in any way."
"The desire of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of Ukraine's RAF, the mass dismissals have led to the low staffing of the units," Maročko quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that real figures designed for the Ukrainian army could be increased if needed.
In 2014 - 2017, Kiev launched a so - called antiterrorism operation (ATO), which was later replaced by the Joint Forces (OIC) operation.
That measure was expected to increase the role of Ukrainian forces in resolving the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbass escalated from the murder of DOJ leader Alexander Zaharchenko.
The DMV authorities described what had happened as a terrorist attack.
Several people involved in the blast were detained during the criminal investigation.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the sabotage was organised by Ukrainian intelligence agencies.

The head of the British MDMA compared the EU to the Soviet Union and the prison
The British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of capturing member countries of the community.
Such a statement was made by a diplomat at the ruling Conservative Party convention in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, 30 September.
As Daily Mail notes, Hunt thus commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiating process.
What happened to faith in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was set up to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not let anyone leave it.
The lesson of history is clear: if you turn the EU from community to prison, the desire to leave it will not diminish, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to flee the prison, " the minister said.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for deciding to withdraw from the European Union would only exacerbate the crisis, notes Gazeta.ru.
In mid - September, British Prime Minister Theresa May stated that the Brexit negotiations had stalled.
So she commented on the outcome of the EU's informal summit in Salzburg.
The Brexit decision was made in 2016 following a referendum.
The withdrawal of the United Kingdom is expected to take place before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by many factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact once London leaves the community.
In addition, the issue on the Irish border remains open.
Further information on European water policy, as well as the full text of legislation and other documents, is available on the commission's web site.6

The head of the Italian celebrity has stopped the hunger strike to protect the interests of residents.
The deputy reported on his Facebook page that he had stopped starving for several reasons.
The head of the Selsové said that the situation had stalled, that the district administration was not responding to its demands, and that it needed to carry out its work.
In addition, the Prosecutor's Office has launched a review of the situation and the heatwave organisation STPC has promised to begin work to prepare the system for the passage of the winter heating period of the village of Siberia next week.
The villagers also produced and took the governor of Altai province a massive collective appeal "concerning the current catastrophic situation ."
Boronin himself stated that he felt normal, his duties as head during the hunger strike were fully fulfilled.
As Boronin explained, the villages of Siberia and Rogulic have centralized heatwave systems, and therefore the authority to prepare them for winter must be exercised by the administration of the First District.
However, so far, no one has started these work.
The head of the Selsoman also protested the lack of proper control and support from the Government of the Altay province and against the financial policies of Gazprom regióngaz Novosibirsk.
In addition to the proper preparation of the villages for the winter, Boronin demanded that a full self @ communal section with the appropriate plaintiffs be organized immediately within the municipality's territory.

Moscow's new buildings with the cheapest apartments have been named
In the first half of 2018, Moscow's new buildings bought about 3,000 housing units with an area of 30 square metres and a value of up to four million rubles.
More than half of these deals came from two JCs, as evidenced by the Urbanus portal (available to Lents.ru).
The J.C. Nekrasovka, located behind mcad, in the Kotelniki (uwao) area, and the Barbaris apartment complex in Bibirevo (swao), were the leaders of housing sales in the budget for up to four million rubles.
Notable in the structure of budget housing deals were also two JCs in New Moscow, South Bunino and Clean Halls.
Urbanus analysts note that the proportion of apartment deals up to four million rubles in these new buildings reaches 60 per cent of all sales and provides half of the total revenue.
"The impact of apartments with a budget of less than four million rubles on the commercial successes of the Central Microrail in the New Watutinas and JC Filatov Luge should be recognized," according to the study of two other JCs of New Moscow.
They account for about 35 per cent of financial revenue.
Previously, the rankings of Moscow's areas with the cheapest apartments in the new buildings were presented at the Bon Tong Real Estate Agency.
According to the company, the lowest prices for primary housing (149.9,000 rubles per metre) were recorded in the yuwao in September 2018.
The second and third places were wao and wao, with figures of 184.1 and 192.8,000 roubles respectively.

Telegram users complained of a malfunction in the new version's work
IPhone users have complained about problems in the work of Messenger Telegram following an update on 28 September.
The user's phone number can be learned by its desert
Complaints concern gadgets with the iOS 12 actuarial operating system.
According to their owners, once updated, the app shows a white screen or closes immediately.
Messenger's representatives responded to the disruption.
They said the problem could be linked to the migration of information to a new app written in Swift's language.
The Telegram temporarily suspended automatic updating of the app until the inconsistencies were corrected.
On 13 April, the Tagan Court of Moscow upheld Roskomnadzor's claim to block Messenger Telegram in Russia.
Three days later, the communications operators began implementing the decision.
The reason was the Messenger administration's refusal to provide the FSB with the keys to decipher the correspondence needed to obtain terrorist data.
In August, Telegram changed its confidentiality policy and agreed to disclose the IP address and mobile phone number of a suspected terrorist user when obtaining the appropriate judgement.
The Telegram audience declined by 1.2 million after locking in the Russian Federation

The governor of the Kurgan region, Alexei Cocorin, will resign as part of a new rotation of the governor's corps, according to the RBC, citing two sources close to the president's administration.
The decision will be formally reported shortly, notes the publication.

Ilon Mask is forced to leave as head of the Tesla Board of Directors
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla founder Ilon Mask settled their controversy in the fraud case.
CNBC News reports.
According to the television station, as part of the agreements reached, Mask will have to leave as head of Tesla's board of directors.
In doing so, the commission allowed Mask to retain the post of Tesla's supervisor.
As noted, the Tesla founder will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
A similar amount will also be recovered from Tesla.
In doing so, the money will be distributed between affected investors.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Ilon Mask is an American entrepreneur who is on the list of 50 richest people on the planet, according to Forbes magazine.
He is the head of SpaceX's space corporation, Neuralink's neurotech company and Tesla's electric car maker, as well as Paypal's co - founder.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had previously sued Tesla CEO Ilona Maska over his report published in a tweet about the company's possible ransom.
Last month, Mask announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy all stock on the stock market at a fixed price of $420.
The value of the stock of $420 was allegedly "because of the significance of this number in the marijuana culture," previously reported by Bloomberg, citing the commission's head of security, Stephen Peykin.
In doing so, Ilon Mask subsequently abandoned his plans to buy out the shares.
Commenting on the lawsuit filed against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman stated that he considered fraud allegations unfounded, and added that he was very disappointed and disappointed with these claims.
"Honour is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I have not violated it in any way," the businessman said in an interview with CNBC.
In August, however, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a collective claim against Mask, complaining of financial losses incurred.
The plaintiffs claimed that the businessman's posts had caused them damages.
In particular, one shareholder stated that the businessman's tweets were misleading, from which Tesla stock sellers were forced to purchase papers at artificially overpriced prices to cover their positions.
Other plaintiffs also pointed out that Ilon Mask's indiscretions led to sharp rate fluctuations.
In September, Ilona Maska also accused the head of research company Citron Research of stock market fraud.
Meanwhile, if Mask had not been able to settle his dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, he would be facing a suspension from the company's management and even a prison.
This was, in particular, claimed to CNBC by the former chairman of the commission, Harvey Pitt.
Mask is a "good guy who can't run a car company."

On 30 September 1928, i.e. exactly 90 years ago, British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming announced the unforgettable opening.
The opening of penicillin marked the beginning of an era of modern antibiotics, brought global glory to Fleming and made it a Nobel laureate.
By the way, the allocation of penicillin from mold mushrooms was not the first opening of Fleming.
A few years earlier, he, being cold, sowed a sleeve from his own nose on a Petri cup (this is such a glass roof that runs experiences with bacteria) and found days later that the bacteria there had been destroyed.
Almost as accidentally, they were also found with penicillin.
Fleming's name was listed as 100 of the most outstanding personalities in human history.
Its discovery, according to many scientists, has changed the course of history.
With the help of penicillin, medicine began to cope with most of the ancient diseases previously considered incurable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene...
When, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, Fleming arrived in the French capital in 1945, the Paris newspapers wrote: "To break fascism and liberate France, he did more than dozens of divisions."
Experts estimate that the discovery by Fleming of the world's first antibiotic saved the lives of more than 200 million Earth's inhabitants.
Alexander Fleming died in his home in London in 1955 from a heart attack.
He was cremated and a week later his ashes were buried in the famous London Cathedral of Saint Paul.
Where, by the way, my wife and I have drawn attention to this by a diligent Russian-speaking tour guide.

They will be assigned to the paradise of the Slobodsky, Cotelnic, Wyatscopolian and Soviet regions.
The complexes contribute to the early detection of tuberculosis and other chest diseases outside hospitals.
As the governor of the Kirov region, Igor Vasiliev, said, these mobile fluorescents belong to a new generation and are digital.
This will enable the swift transmission of information.
Previously, there were only similar mobile fluorescents at the Camaz base.
It is planned that the new complexes will increase the coverage of the population by 15 per cent of the fluorescent survey.
So far, 7 mobile florographers have been used in the Kirov region (2 in Kirov, one in Wyat Polyans, Urjum, Kirovo - Chepeck, Omouthninsk and Slobodsk).

Will aspirin be protected from stroke?
This is an information echo after the European Congress of Cardiologists, responded by Nikita Lomakin, chief cardiologist of the cqb, President of the Russian Federation.
There were reports that aspirin is not protected in primary prevention in people at low risk of heart and vascular disease.
Professionals are aware of this.
But it effectively protects against heart attacks and strokes in primary prevention in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease, as well as in patients with ischemic heart disease or other manifestations of atherosclerosis.
In these cases, it remains a means No. 1.

Trump talked about 'falling in love' in Kim Jong Un
From mutual cruelty, the leaders of the United States and the DPRK barely went to fall in love with each other, Donald Trump joked.
U.S. President Donald Trump has noted a good joke about his successes on the front of resolving the North Korean crisis.
Having started with mutual threats of destruction, the leaders of the two countries have now managed relations so much that they are barely in love with each other, the President of the United States has noted.
The owner of the White House recalled that he had accepted the North Korean problem from the previous administration as a major difficulty in foreign policy.
Trump noted that Barack Obama's team had launched relations with the DPRK so much that it could not even reach the country's leadership - where they simply did not answer the phone.
Then the United States and the DPRK were on the doorstep of war, and today the North Korean leader writes "excellent letters " to the White House, Trump noted.
Trump acknowledged that at the beginning of his work, too, "was cruel" to Kim Jong Un, which, however, was mutual.
Now, however, their relationship has excelled so much that the leaders have "fallen in love with each other ."
Trump, however, asked not to take his words literally and warned that the American media was stalling them as incompetence.
Trump has drawn attention to the fact that Pyongyang has recently stopped nuclear and missile tests, and is closing military sites.
All of this is the merits of his administration's work, I'm sure of the President of the United States.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump flattered Kim Jong Une from the rostrum of the United Nations General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for his bravery and the steps taken to defuse tensions.
Trump, however, noted that sanctions against the DPRK would persist until the full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
Talks in Singapore
On 12 June, Singapore hosted the first U.S. and North Korean leaders talks in history.
After a serious escalation of relations and mutual threats to the use of nuclear weapons, the summit appeared to be a fracture in the protracted American - Korean crisis.
As a result of the talks, the parties expressed their intention to move towards a peaceful resolution of the controversies, although they did not commit themselves to any legal obligation.
The positive outcome of the meeting was the end of the DPRK's nuclear and missile tests, as well as the return to the United States of America's remains of soldiers in the country.
Along with that, other practical steps towards the denuclearization of North Korea are still towing.
The media reported that after the Singapore summit, the United States had sent several disarmament scenarios to the DPRK already, but Pyongyang rejected them, calling them "gangsters."

Nicoi called for the "Moscow language " to be expelled by Ukrainian product
The Ukrainian children's writer and fighter for the purity of the native language, Larissa Nicoy, called for the expulsion from Ukraine of "Russian Moscow product and Moscow language."
It offers to do so as a Ukrainian product, a "cultural wave, culturally natiful."
Nico shared its thoughts on the "feasibility of eradicating Russian in Ukraine" with the Ukrainian publication "Observer."
She said the Ukrainian product in question is now being prepared - it is even already eating and continues to evolve further.
Over time, Ukrainians will "recover" from this "Moscow language," she is convinced.
For example, in neighbouring Poland, she said, Russian speech was used widely on television and radio, but it was virtually not left in the public space.
However, according to Nico, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities banning the use of the Russian language, in her view, are only "an expansion of borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level ."
Nico had previously shared the experience of maintaining a "Ukrainian regime" at a children's camp in Carpatah, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the court's network of Watsons bookstores, one of whom had spoken to her in Russian.
Having not achieved his own, Nicoy threw a handover into the girl.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians it calls "language schizophrenia," calling on Ukrainians to give up Russian letters even in the writing of names.
Nicoy recently stated that the name "Russ" had been stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscovia.
The writer's anger could not be avoided even by the Ukrainian Security Service: when she arrived there and heard staff talking to each other in Russian, she caused the scandal and left by slamming the door.

There was a men's conversation at the break, and it brought its fruits.
Urala defender Denis Kulakov is about winning Arsenal (2: 1) in the ninth round of the Russian Championship.
"Denise, by what do you think it has succeeded in winning?"
"I think we wanted to win more," cites Kulakov's official website Urala.
'This complicated game took place, had a serious male conversation at the break, and it brought its fruits: scored two balls and didn't miss it.
'you've missed a few games because of the damage you suffered at the beginning of the month.
How did it feel today? '
'If you've lasted 90 minutes, then it's fine!
In fact, it felt good.

'it's no secret to anyone that after winning and recovering is easier, and the mood in the collective is good.

We need to continue in the same spirit and please the fans. "
'you miss the game for not going out on the field? '
'There is this, it has been a little missed because the really, unpleasant situation has come out.
But again, thank you to the physiotherapist and doctors for putting them on their feet.
The most important thing is that we have won and pleased the fans.
And the rest is secondary. "

In a referendum in Macedonia, violations were recorded
Four incidents involving violations of electoral law have been registered in the Republic of Macedonia in a referendum on an intergovernmental treaty with Greece to rename.
This was reported on Sunday by the press secretary of the Interior Ministry, Tony Angelowski.
There have been 4 incidents since the opening of polling stations that have been resolved, he said.
At the polling station at Lazo Angelowski Elementary School in Skopje, the 22 - year - old K.J. violated public order and calm, insulted citizens and attacked police officers.
He is detained and taken to the police station.
According to a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all the offenders were immediately taken to police stations.
The ministry noted that all violations were being investigated.
'The ministry will act in accordance with the law so that citizens can safely exercise the constitutional right to express their will freely.
We call on citizens to abide by the laws and to refrain from any violations of public order and tranquillity and any violation of the secret of voting, " said the representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
Citizens are asked to answer one question in Sunday's referendum: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Greece?"
The referendum is intended to resolve the 27 - year dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek region.
The heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Macedonia and Greece on June 17, during a solemn ceremony on the shores of Lake Prespa, which runs the border between the two countries, signed an agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav republic.
It provides for the use of the name "Republic of Northern Macedonia."
This treaty must resolve not only a yearslong dispute over the country's name, but also open Skopje's path to NATO and the EU.
I understand what a blow this is for you, but you all try to calm down and sit down better.

Syria's head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Russia's decision to supply C - 300 is a timely step
Russia's decision to supply anti - aircraft missile complexes (ZRC) C - 300 to Syria is a timely step.
This view was expressed by the head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Walid Muallem, in an interview with RT that aired on Sunday.
If we analyse the importance of protecting the Syrian sky, we will see that this is a sign of security and stability rather than war.
I want to say that this is a very timely step, and we are very grateful in this regard to Russia for its efforts, " the Minister noted.
The head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stressed that the C - 300 is a defensive rather than offensive system, and it is designed to protect the Syrian sky.
Pashinan hopes to hold early elections in Armenia's parliament in 2018
Armenia's parliamentary elections could be held as early as 2018, the country's prime minister, Nicole Pashinyan, said.
"It is possible, before the end of the year," the head of government responded to a question by journalists about the timing of their conduct (a quote on Interfax).
Mr. Pashinyan also did not rule out that he would "take people back to the streets" for an extraordinary election if discussion of the issue with parliamentary forces did not succeed.
But I am committed to negotiating with parliamentary forces.
I hope that they are also committed to a constructive dialogue, "the Prime Minister of News - Armenia quotes.
Nicole Pashinyan added that early elections were a "demand of the people" as well as part of the Government's programme for which Parliament voted.
"The Government's long vision," he said, was also necessary to attract investment and develop the economy.
At the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Mr. Pashinyan promised after returning to Yerevan to begin "talks with representatives of all parliamentary as well as nonpartisan forces to discuss the time and conditions of early elections ."
In the current parliament, about half of the deputies represent the opposition Mr. Pashinan of the Armenian Republican Party (RPA).
Early voting is not possible without the dissolution of Parliament, and there are no legitimate grounds for doing so yet.

The charge for the Dagestan deputy has become new
The Soviet District Court of Mahacalla has jailed for two months Dagestan Rajab Abdulatipowa, a deputy of the People's Assembly, suspected of engaging in a criminal community that has formalized a handicap for bribery.
The E.E. has become aware of the details of the investigation that shed light on how, according to the Russian Investigative Committee, the younger brother of the former head of the republic, Ramasan Abdulathipov, Rajab Abdoulatipov, has now contributed to criminal actions by the former head of the General Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise, Magomed Mahachev, and his associates.
Among other things, in the course of operational - search activities carried out by Home Office officials, it was found that Rajab Abdulathipov had lobbied the appointment of Magomed Mahachev as head of the bureau, allegedly receiving 70 million roubles for that.
Let us recall that an earlier investigation into Magomed Mahachev, other heads and staff of the territorial Bureau of Medical and Social Sciences underpinned by him, led to a criminal case under Section 210 (establishment of a criminal community using and participating in a service position), Section 290 (bribery by an organized group), Section 292 (official bail) and article. 159 (fraud of a particularly large scale) of the Criminal Code.
According to the investigation, in late 2013, Rajab Abdoulatipov, aware of the illegal actions of Magomed Mahachev and his accomplices involved in the theft of the Pension Fund, joined their activities by stepping into the criminal community.
While serving as the head of Russia's Federal Migration Service's Office for Dagestan and having ties with state authorities and law enforcement agencies, as well as enjoying his kinship with the head of Dagestan, Rajab Abdoulatipov, investigators believe, "ensured the activities of other actors in the criminal community, established contacts with state officials to support the illegal activities of Magestan. Gomeda Mahacheva and his tenure as head of the federal treasury agency, the General Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise on the Republic of Dagestan, organized the illegal identification of disabilities to citizens."
Following the release of these information at a meeting of the Soviet District Court on Friday, Rajab Abdulatypov rejected the charges against him.
"Of course, everything that is being charged to me today is all this new to me, completely I'm not familiar with it," he said.
The court arrested the deputy from Unity Russia not for ten days before the charge was brought, as was the case with previous high - ranking Dagestan officials, but immediately for two months, as article 210 of the Criminal Code features in his case.
According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, there is much more time for the inquiry to be charged - up to 45 days from the time of detention.

Evkurov responded to the oil claims of "fans "
The inguish village of Dattah, where oil is allegedly scheduled to be extracted, will not be transferred to Chechnya.

The President of Serbia wants to ask Putin for support
The President of Serbia, Alexander Vucic, will discuss the situation with Russian colleague Vladimir Putin with Kosovo and ask for his support during the meeting in Moscow.
Serbian President Alexander Vucic will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.
During the meeting, he plans to discuss the current situation with a colleague from the Russian Federation with Kosovo.
In addition, Vucic intends to ask Putin for support.
A statement was made by the Serbian leader during the press conference, and was transmitted by the local newspaper "Evening News ."
According to the source, the head of Serbia clarified that, referring to the need for support from the Russian side, he did not mean military support on the example of Syria.
Alexander Vucic stated that he did not wish to allow a scenario in which some major military clashes could occur within the state.
The President of the country has promised to make the best efforts to keep the peace, transmitting the publication.
Adding that according to Serbian media information, the meeting of the heads of Russia and Serbia is scheduled for the coming Tuesday, 2 October, by Lenta.ru.
A day earlier, it became known that the Serbian president had brought the state's army to full combat readiness because of the situation with Kosovo.
This is the events of last Friday, when several dozens of Kosovo's special forces entered the territory that straddles to a lake supplying water to the Gaza hydroelectric power plant.

Kosachev: at the 73rd session of the un General Assembly, Russia's theme was virtually absent in a negative way
Konstantin Kosachev, head of the Committee of the Federation Council for International Affairs, considers the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly to be a success for Russia and does not rule out that it will be able to become a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an inalienable participant in addressing global world problems.
"The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my view, is that the rhetoric we have already been nearly used to in recent years regarding Russia has now been more detached to the order," the senator said in an interview published on Sunday by the Russian newspaper.
He explained that in previous years, the Russian Federation had sometimes "identified as one of the three main threats to humanity, that along with Ebola fever, that along with climate change or terrorism, Russia had been in this row, anyway, in the setting of a group of Western countries that had spoken quite unanimously in that regard."
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed, "Russia's theme was virtually absent in a negative way."
"If we look closely at the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the Foreign Minister of Germany, I am not taking Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, anyway, the choir was not entirely accurate," the politician drew attention, noting that Russia was "no longer a wall to be trained on by the tennis ball strikes."
The head of the Sowfeed Professional Committee does not rule out that this indicates some trend that he believes "will highlight the current session [of the United Nations General Assembly], although this trend may be fully evident in a year, two, three later."
"I do not rule out that the current session may in some sense be a turning point," Kosachev admitted, explaining that "there are too many examples of how with Russia's involvement it is possible to move forward in international affairs."
He cited the situations in Syria, around Iran and North Korea as an example.
"So far, unfortunately, it is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be required over time," the parliamentarian added.
This is because he believes that there is "an adequate, sound perception of Russia as not just a possible - integral participant in tackling the global problems of modernity."
"I wouldn't want to make a mistake, but I have the feeling that we are somewhere going through a point where the movement will no longer be reversed, it will move forward," he added.
Another "interesting and important feeling" in this context, Kosachev called "a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should evolve."
"I have attended very many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the General Assembly] of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, I have held my own meetings, and I am delighted to see that if, another year - two or five years ago, Russian opinion, the Russian vision of what is happening in the world, largely now, no one has been interested, the situation is different, " said the Chairman of the Sowfeed Committee.
In his view, this is due to the fact that "the so - called new liberal order that represents the West has no answers to questions about how to address the world's problems because of the apparent lack of ideas in the global space, a lack of ideas about how to address the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of nuclear nonproliferation, the problems of migration."
"And here, the request for a Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious," expressed the confidence of Kosachev, stressing that he believes in this sense "the current session is fortunate for the work of the Russian delegation, which is fortunate for Russia."

Damascus declared its right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that military force will not have to be applied in the Syrian province of Idlib, said Walid Muallem, head of the Syrian Arab Republic's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
However, he said Syria had the right to do so.
The Minister added that Turkey has the opportunity to quickly resolve the problem of disqualifying militants from the Russian-banned organization Jebhat an Nusra from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, according to Ria Novosti.
The head of MDMA also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to a military solution to the problem of areas east of Euphrates if the Kurds sought secession.
At the same time, Muallem believes that talks with the Kurdish SDF forces were good until they were interrupted from the us.
On 17 September, Putin and Turkish President Recep Erdogan agreed to establish a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between armed opposition and government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib by 15 October.

'i couldn't even hold a spoon'
Wahtang Kicabidze on cancer
Many artists are now talking about how they managed oncology.
The disease unfortunately spares no one, and the history of popular people winning cancer gives hope to many sick people.
The renowned actor Wahtang Kikabidze admitted that he was alive only because of his wife.
Many years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis, which sounded like a sentence.
'i'm like a hammer down the skull was struck.
I fell.
Lost orientation.
Placed in the hospital.
The spoon could not hold there, could not stand there, fell all the time.
The analyses started, turned out to be bad things, the arteries don't miss blood.
Brought to Moscow, it said that I had a large grooming cyst in my head, and had an urgent operation.
And during the surgery, doctors behind the cyst saw a tumor, "Kikabidze told the program" Once. "
The tumor was malignant.
Then, 37 years ago, residents of Tbilisi even came to say goodbye to the cummy on the doorstep of his home.
But the actor's wife did not allow a living actor to be buried, she holy believed that she would be able to cope with the disease and had not wasted more than a year from the bed of her beloved wife.
If it weren't for Irene, I wouldn't be alive now.
Always when I had critical situations, she was around like a rock, "the actor admitted.
The actor has been able to cope with the disease, now he is happily living in his home in the centre of Tbilisi.
And occasionally, the rumours of his illness, the untimely death that the case appears on the Network, are denied.
The creators of the Peacemaker website contributed Peter Syyarto, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary, to the "Purgatory " section.
The reason was "an attempt on Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity ."
In addition, the head of the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the neighbours, was officiated in "direct threats of invasion of Ukraine" and "supporting separatist sentiments in Ukraine" as well as in participating "in the organization of provocation aimed at massively violating Ukraine's citizens' legislation."
Let us note that the hint of Kievo - Pecher Lavra Pavel and the foreman of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchs) of Onufrey was served in front of Syyarto in the Purgatory.
The reason was their opposition to obtaining Tomos by the Ukrainian estate church.
Earlier, commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in Zacarpaty, the President of Ukraine, Peter Poroshenko, demanded respect for Ukraine's sovereign rights.

The authorities named the amount of the "gold parachute" of the Crown Deputy Governor
A lump sum of 23 salaries to the Deputy Governor of the Voronezh region, Yuri Agibalov, was paid on the basis of the regional Public Posts Act.
At the same time, the real amount of the "gold parachute" released from office was several times less than the amount stated in the media.
Such explanations were provided to the press office of the regional government.
According to the law, the salary for Agibalova's position is 11,189 rubles.
Thus highlighted in the press, the size of the lump-sum payment amounted to the deduction of income tax of 223 892 rubles, rather than the 1 million rubles the media wrote about.
The official has received an old age insurance pension since July 2018.
His internship in public office is more than nine years old.
The appointment of this pension and lump sum to him is made immediately after being dismissed from office, the RIA News Agency in the area's government explained.
At the same time, Agibalov's pension prepayment was suspended when he was assigned to public service, and his salary size did not change compared to the previous period.
The elected governor of the region's rio governor, Alexander Gusev, took office on 15 September.
Agibalova was freed from office due to the expiration of the term of office of the wrio head of the area.
Similarly, the credentials of other officials who held public office in the region have been completed.
On 29 September, Telegram - channel Nezygary published documents from which it followed that Agibalov, who had left as vice-governor, had been paid a severance benefit of 23 salaries, and two days after that he received a similar post again without the impersonation of "vrio."

State deputy called for schoolchildren to be told about the harm of masturbation
Onychenko serves as the first deputy chairman of the Committee on Education and Science.
Based on his work experience, he noted in an interview that teenagers are provoking the harmful information they find online to masturbate.
Fighting this is at the level of educational institutions and the family, the deputy added.
Gennady Onychenko, deputy state of the Russian Federation (in an interview with the Govorit Moscow radio station:
As part of the overall sex education of children, this needs to be done by explaining the pugubu because there is a risk to the child's sexual health, both boys and girls.
The problem is objective, it is that the ripeness of children comes early enough, and there are further large scissors between their sexual maturation and the possibility of official interpolar contacts.
According to Onychenko, tackling the problem is hampered by "banning," silenced by "sex problems" and lack of a culture of adequate child rearing.
The doctor is confident that many teenagers are facing downhill.
The deputy believes that practising lessons on the harm of sheнизma is primarily in the schools of "hyper-urbanized" regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim republic, we will simply not be understood with you, to put it mildly," said the professor.

Adg became second in popularity in Germany
The anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany is hitting another record of popularity, and Angela Merkel's ratings are falling.
It seems that Germans have begun to be seriously tired of Angela Merkel's immigration policy, which has led the country to become a premeditated target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
The latest social surveys suggest that the Alternative for Germany anti-immigrant party is becoming increasingly popular and the positions of Merkel and Zeehofer's governing bloc are weakening.
This week, the Adh hit another record, climbing the second line in the rankings of people's sympathies.
Right conservatives with 17 per cent of popularity have managed to bypass the Social Democrats, who have about 16 per cent.
The gap of one percentage point can be written off as a statistical error, but it cannot be noted, however, that the Adga, established in 2013 from a small group of economists - Eurosceptics, has been able to turn into a serious political force.
Leadership in the overall set so far continues to be held by the ruling HCC / HDS bloc, which has some 30 per cent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points here - back in April, Angela Merkel's bloc support was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German Chancellor, who leads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48 per cent of Germans are in favour of Angela Merkel, which is 7 per cent lower than last year.
In addition, the Greens (15 per cent), the Left (11 per cent) and the Liberals (10 per cent) were followed by the Social Democrats.
Evolution of Alternatives
The Alternative for Germany party was established in September 2012 on the basis of the Alternative Choice 2013 group, which included the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially stood in opposition to the government course, but only economic issues, including euro issues and interactions within the EU, were dealt with at the first time.
However, the group opposed Germany's "sponsoring" of the EU's weak economies, and did not rule out the possibility of a return to the German mark and the country's full withdrawal from the European Union.
Against the backdrop of the deepening immigration crisis, Adh's political platform has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full party that occupied a niche of Eurosceptics and began to severely criticize the government for failing immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the Adh managed to get to Bundestag for the first time, receiving 94 seats (of 709).
Two representatives of the Alternatives for Germany get seats in the European Parliament.
A video has been published with a journalist calling Ukrainian citizens a "nation of bollocks"
The leading political talk show on Ukrainian TV, the author of two books, Ostap Drosdov, admitted lively that he believed his compatriots to be a "nation of bollocks."

As Drosdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
"We have not been vaccinated since childhood with a culture of reading and acceptance of texts," said the journalist.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drosdov's words, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee on Television and Broadcasting, has begun to combat the literature, which has the slightest hint of criticism of the Kiev authorities by banning the entry of 201 editions.

Anyone who wants to buy this car can buy it.
Roshel Defence Solutions stated that it was already accepting applications for its new armour.
Armchair apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
On the subject of apocalypse, money is not only made by video game manufacturers, film studios and book publishers.
The new niche is now being embraced by car companies as well.
So Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions presented its armoured apocalypse senator APC.
In a free time of fantasy, the engineers of this company are creating armoured vehicles for the police.
Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers who are not particularly comfortable but fully safely housed in a targeted armchair.
This bunker, otherwise, will not be named because its reservation level is in line with standard B7, is installed on a chassis of a powerful Ford Super Duty pickup.
Its bottom, also armoured, is capable of protecting the capsule from bombings by grenades and anti - personnel mines.
Roshel Senator APC's armoured apocalypse salon
To ensure that passengers are not even hurt by an explosive wave from a snap near the car, the car salon is equipped with special amortizing chairs.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and firefighting system.
For a safe review, Roshel Senator APC's car is equipped with a circular view camera system with a night vision function, as well as a viewing armoured tower on the roof.
There are no weapons in the car.
Front of the armoured apocalypse Roshel Senator APC saloon
To prevent the severity of the armoured vehicle from affecting its mobility, Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330 - strong enduring turbo diesel engine of 6.7 litres, all of which power is transferred to four wheels of armour through a 6 - foot automatic gearbox.
There is no chance of getting stuck at all by an apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
The armour of the apocalypse Roshel Senator APC can be seen at a specialized exhibition in Washington, D.C., to be held in October.

Name of the time of death of the Universe
The universe is still roughly 140 billion years old, ten times the age of the world seen, which is about 13.8 billion years old.
The study by an international team of scientists is put into the arXiv.org Library of electronic preprints and is aimed at publishing in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, according to the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Such findings were reached by specialists watching, with the help of the HSC (Hyper Suprime - Cam) telescope Subaru, about ten million galaxies.
Tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, accounting for more than 95 per cent of energy - the masses of the observed world, scientists, working as part of the standard cosmological model λcdm (^ Cold Dark Matter), assessed the rate of expansion of the universe, which was slightly slower than previously thought.
The Subaru Observatory's press release notes that the observations allowed for a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, and the data from the European Space Telescope Planck clarified the limitations placed on the λcdm parameters.
In July, scientists modeled the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues presented new arguments that the watched world would cease to exist after 22 billion years as a result of the Greater Difference.

Another attempt to unite the proponents of the pension referendum failed
The opportunity to learn the people's views on pension reform is postponed indefinitely
There was a meeting of the Commonwealth Action Group of the referendum against raising the retirement age in Moscow on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups who registered different wordings of the issues (a total of five formulations were registered by the Central Bureau).
They decided to apply to the CEC for the registration of a single action group and ask the Russians the question: "Are you in favour of not raising the age defined by the pension legislation as of July 1, 2018, at which time Russian citizens are entitled to an old age pension?"
This language was registered by a voodoo sub-group whose representatives were not involved in the meeting, but it was found to be the simplest and most legally binding.
The majority of the participants in the assembly were supporters of Justice Russia member Ilya Sviridova (six subgroups) and the cpf (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups, from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Sviridov previously told the Waters that the invitations had been sent to all initials, and the agreement to come had been expressed by representatives of some 40 subgroups.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who chaired the Vologda Subgroup (its wording was supported by 15 other sub-groups), said to the Waters that the invitations had not been received and had not been planned to come: "We did not understand who the friend was but who the enemy was."

I am surprised that the backfires in the fifth round of Spartacus - Dinamo, neither Turbin himself nor DSI leaders have drawn serious conclusions about his low qualifications.
The result did not slow down in the ninth round: errors in its actions, private passages of rough admissions soared as a horn of abundance.
For example, in the 50th minute, Eder's railroad bursts with his hands in his penalty area of Ahmat Rodolfo's defender.
Eight metres from the gate, but Turbin does not put a penalty.
- How do you assess an episode involving Idow, which was 82 minutes when it appeared to have hit his hand?
- I believe there was a deliberate game here with the defender's hand in his penalty area.
The turbine was near the moment, well seeing the episode and its first assistant on the right.
Reserve Judge Sergey Karasev should have seen this moment as well.
Nevertheless, all three were asleep and no penalty was set.
That's why the score in the game is distorted and sports justice has proved to be flawed.
It was the same case that the judgeship on concepts had harassed and buried the sporting spirit of the game.
For 52 minutes, Turbin did not decide to remove the guest defender Oleg Ivanov, who violated the rules in the fight against the Crown, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, he was demonstrably applauded.
What do you think of this episode?
Did you need to show the second "mustard"?
- At this point, Turbin and the first yellow card were shown not quite in the case.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about the double standards of the judiciary that some teams were being penalized for violations such as the Idow episode and some not.
What do you value the footballer's words?
- Such as double standards are to be understood.
There was a penalty.
It was not given.
Thus, the arbitrator does not give a second penalty to the opposite gate.
This is the principle that is being used.
And the second point of double standards that the judge looks at who plays.
Here he played Locomotion on Saturday and Ahmat has serious claims about Turbin's work because the team has been hampered.
The man changed the floor, became a lesbian.
To his great joy, his team won the game.

Matt Damon played rape accused Judge Kavanaugh at SNL start
American actor Matt Damon played U.S. Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first issue of the new Saturday Night Live broadcast season on NBC.
During a small sketch, the actor played Kavanaugh at a Senate hearing on rape charges.
The candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court has previously drawn attention to his emotionalness and detailing his stories in an interview with Senator Amy Klobushar.
Thus, Kavano has repeatedly acknowledged his love for beer, but has said that he has never been drunk before inpatient.
In addition, in an attempt to acquit himself on rape charges, Kavanaugh claimed that he was a virgin in those years.
Damon also played those moments.
I just did that I drank a lot and didn't think about sex at all.
I was the proudest, most drunken virgin anyone has ever seen.
Everyone is familiar with this, "said the judge in the execution of Matt Damon.
Kavanaugh had previously been elected U.S. Supreme Judge.
But pay attention to the face and body language of everyone present in this odd picture, and you will feel that they are all playing.
But my advice to you is to tell them that they have behaved badly and escaped, and apologize.
Nothing, it's a football match, against Afula, we won, although the judge was Jewish.
Barbra Streisand discovered strangeness in behaviour from her cloned dogs
American singer Barbara Streisand stated that her dead dog clones behave completely differently than the original pet.
'They're not similar.
In fact, [clones] look like her, but it is impossible to clone the soul, " the 76 - year - old singer stressed.
At the end of 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of his 14-year-old dog of the species coton - de - tulear named Samantha, who had to be adopted because of health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that the Chihuahua breeds called Miracle Milly (Miracle Milly), who was named the world's smallest dog, had been cloned for the 49th time.
Specialists are involved in cloning a six - year - old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
U.S. thinks of Russia's maritime blockade from oil and gas supply
In the United States, Russia's maritime blockade could be launched to gain an advantage in the global energy market.
U.S. authorities have been so keen to fight for success in the global carbon market that they are prepared to resort to the maritime blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world's main energy suppliers.
The possibility of a sea blockade was told by the head of the U.S. Home Office, Ryan Zinke, the previous day.
Contrary to world practice, the American Ministry of the Interior performs not police, but civil functions, including natural resources policies.
Zinke's statement was therefore well within the purview of the agency he led, although it was not devoid of political colour.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke stated that, thanks to U.S. naval forces, the naval routes in the Middle East region are controlled and could block them if necessary.
From Zinke's words, it follows that the need may be linked to Washington's desire to interfere with Russian supplies to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia still receives a lion's share of its revenue from oil and gas supplies to the world market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East also, as in Eastern Europe, was the primary motive for boosting Moscow in the region, I'm sure of Zinke.
The minister made it clear that the United States was still looking forward to securing leadership in the global energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do so, Washington will have to discourage Russia and Iran, and the maritime blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure on this path, Zinke believes.
-- I have come to tell you that I am leaving for Moscow tomorrow and I will not return more to this house, and you will have the news of my decision in the face of the lawyer I will hand the divorce case to.

The Islanders are calling for faster digging - mc Sakhalin
There is a campaign to immunize the population against the flu in the Saharan region.
Medics in the island region are calling on residents to be more active and not to ignore doctors' recommendations.
This year, vaccination should cover 219,000 inhabitants of the area, including at least 70 per cent of all children.
To date, vaccinations have already been delivered to 49 - thousands of Somalis and smokers.
More than 10,000 visitors have undergone this procedure at the South Sahalyn Children's City Clinic.
According to health professionals, more others are at risk of "grabbing" at once children from six months, transportation workers, educational and healthcare staff and those who are more likely to others to contact a large number of people.

Supersonic passenger jets in the Russian Federation will be put to serial production
Serial production of supersonic passenger jets in Russia will begin after 2030.
The Director General of the Central Aerogidrodynamic Institute of Zhukovsky Cyril Sypalo said that.
He said the research centre was working on supersonic topics, both as part of international consortiums and cooperation with the Ministry of Trade.
"We feel it will take two to three years to get a technology demonstrator, as well as another 10 to 15 years to get a serial machine that allows transportation through the plains of our homeland," Sypalo added.
He clarified that there was now a question before Russian professionals about how to make the technique economical and safe at the same time.
In early September, the pao's Tupolev aviation technology developer announced the completion of pre-projected work on a supersonic passenger aircraft, estimated to be able to develop speeds of up to 1,900km / h at an altitude of 11km.

The President of Ukraine, Peter Poroshenko, thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin for making Ukraine more European.
He announced it on CNN.
He said he could only confirm the words of the Washington Post columnist that the result of Putin's aggression against Ukraine was the unification of Ukrainians.

The road violin was handed over to the pawn shop for invaluables
When a man in the town of Somerville (Massachusetts) pawn shop lBC Boutique and Loan brought a violin for looking old and unresponsive tool, a pawn shop worker offered only $50.
But the experienced store manager Dylan McDermitt suspected it was an old and expensive tool and sought advice from the expert.
It was also revealed that the violin was produced in 1759 by the famous Italian violin master Ferdinando Galyano and estimated at $250,000.
Alone fluctuations to the violin are estimated at $16 to $18,000.
The investigation revealed that the violin had been stolen from one of the city's residents not long ago, and the tool had been returned to the rightful owner.
It is not yet known how the violin reached the person who passed it into the pawn shop, but there are no previous clashes with the law behind it.
The manager says that all of the pawns bearing the violin will now be asked to play on it to make sure it truly belongs to the customer.

In the ninth round of the RPL, we are facing an exciting confrontation: Spartacus will take on the Rostov stadium in Tushina, led by Valeria Karpin, a man known to be no stranger to the "people's team" at all.

London has raised accusations against Moscow
Russia is trying to rewrite the outcome of the Cold War, British Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson said.
But England will defend its values, he stressed during a speech at the ruling Conservative Party convention in Birmingham.
Threats are increasing, Iran and North Korea are increasingly dangerous, with enemies operating in grey zones through cyber attacks and false news, the minister added.
But the biggest of them is Russia, which is stepping up its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Such statements by Moscow's Western politicians have been repeatedly denied by the TSA.
At the same time, the head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jeremy Hunt, announced that Russia would have to pay a high price if it did not adhere to international rules and use chemicals.
Hunt mentioned the story of the poisoning in the English city of Solsbury in March this year of ex - Gru colonel Sergei Skripal, convicted of spying in favour of Britain, and his daughter Yulia.
In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, there is a referendum to join the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the country's name.
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27 - year dispute with neighbouring Greece over the name of the country, which coincides with the name of the neighbouring Greek province.
One of the first was voted by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a hot supporter of renaming the Republic into Northern Macedonia.
International organizations are watching for preparations for the referendum and today's vote.

The translator compared the mentality of Russians and Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but few differences between them do not play a major role in understanding.
This was told on International Translator Day, 30 September, by a professional translator, the synchronist, Barbel Sachs.
It has been working on translations from Russian and English for more than 30 years.
"The Germans love to plan events quietly, and the Russians, as the pound says," long charging, yes fast going. "
But I don't think it plays a weighty role for understanding between peoples and for the work of an interpreter, "said the specialist in the commentary on the RIA News.
According to the translator, to understand that the two countries will not get around each other, "it is enough to know history."

Russia is a natural part of Europe, there is no point in trying to ignore it.

On average, 13 − 17 degrees of heat is expected in Ukraine during the afternoon of 1 October, in the south and in Zacarpaty - 17 − 22 degrees.
In Kiev, it will also be dry and sunny on the first day of October.

Putin has appointed a new Chief of the President's Office of Foreign Policy
Vladimir Putin, by his decree, released Alexander Manjosin from the post of Chief of the President's Office of Foreign Policy.
Igor Neverov has been appointed to that post instead.
Mr. Manjosin has been in charge of the President's Office of Foreign Policy since 2004.
As one of the reasons for his departure, a source close to the Kremlin called the personal circumstances, noting that there were no substantive claims on the quality of work to the head of management.

Comedy "Evening School" led the American boxing office
The "Evening School" comedy, which debuted in American cinemas last Friday, earned $28 million for its first weekend in rent.
That result allowed an unimaginable picture with Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish to lead the U.S. box office from 28 to 30 September in the main roles.
On the international market, the film, so far only in 20 countries, has raised $5.5 million, including 2 million from British viewers.
In the fight for the first line, Malcolm Lee's creation, which is remarkable enough, was tangiblely ahead of another novelist of the Western rent, the Smallfoot cartoon, a curious history of dating a charming yeti with a representative of a human species whose existence the main hero never believed.
The directors' project, Cary Kirkpatrick and Jason Reysiga, raised $23 million over their starting weekend, generally meeting the expectations of experts predicting a tape of 20 - 25 million over the weekend.
As for the total fees of Smallfoot, they currently amount to $38.6 million (with it already debuted in 50 countries): the most active here was Mexico, which toppled the film's treasury by 3.6 million.
The three of the strongest on this occasion closed the children's tale "The Tyne Home With Hours" from the horror master of Ela Roth, who finally proved that the director was able to make quality cinema and for audiences 12 +.
In its second week in rent, the screening of John Bellers' book with a charming Jack Black with Kate Blanchett earned $12.5 million, bringing the total world fees to 53.8 million.
Despite flying out of the top three, it continues to surprise the "+" triller with Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick's "simple request": in 17 days in the American rental, the picture of Paul Figa, from which some unrealistic financial imperfections were initially not expected from the word "entirely," raised $43 million (including 6.6 million 28 - 30 October) and right now has 62.9 million total earnings.
The last spokesman for the first five this week was the Monkey Curse, which gathered $5.4 million during the reporting period.
The back-to-back "spell" on 24 days in American (and not only, of course) cinemas has $330 million in total earnings and has recently been proud to bear the title of the franchise's most successful film, which also includes two parts of the "spell itself" and two tapes of Annabel's creepy doll.
Following the horror of Corin Hardy, another spokesman of the genre, the debutant of Hellfest, one of the main youth choirs of the year, was placed directly following the horror of Corin Hardy over the past weekend.
On his first weekend, Gregory Plotkin, the children of a notorious editor (and from a recent director) who had previously worked in a number of big choir projects, including Happy Day of Death, for which Hellfest was heavily resembling places, earned $5.1 million in the United States.
Given the film's modest budget, the result is extremely positive.
The seventh was "Crazyly rich Asians" ($4.15 million), which seems to and do not think of falling out of the top 10 American box office: the romantic comedy that has been on screens for the seventh week, is the sixth in the ranking of the genre's most casual ribbons in the history with the indicator in September. 161.7 million.
This is the amount the picture has earned so far in the domestic market - the total lens earnings is 218.8 million.
As for the last three lucky men who hit a dozen in U.S. fees from 28 to 30 September, they were Hicknam, White Guy Rick and... Bagro Meat, earning $3.7 million, $2.38 million and $1.1 million respectively over the past weekend.
Adding that already next weekend, the U.S. will be gathering the long-awaited Vienna with Tom Hardy, who - in that can be no doubt - wields leadership in the U.S. box office through the first weekend of October.
From the other premiere of the coming week, it is worth highlighting the musical, the "Star was born," the Venice Film Festival laureate from Bradley Cooper, and the criminal drama "Your hate."

'it's infamous cummy'
The audience is outraged by Agutin's choice on the Voice Show
The audience of the Voice 60 + show accuses mentor Leonid Agutin of "infamous cummy and naughty subtleness."
When in blind auditions, he learned his father's voice from the first note, Nicolas Agutina, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not turn to the perpetrator.
But son feelings took over and he chose a relative to his team.
At the time, many found it a joke, but forgave the instructor of inclusivity in the first phase.
But the "joke" has dragged on, and the star's father has absolutely unreasonably taken the place of more decent performers.
And now the audience is no longer willing to forgive Agutin for such injustice.
Yesterday we, the show's audience, were resented by the clueless and frank sweeping of our close relatives to the final ladder.
I had already even doubted that Agutin would have enough strength and conscience not to drag his dad to the end of his entirely first place, "Irina Petrovska and Xenia Larina reasoned in the TV Man programme.
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father, Leonid Agutin "leaked" the excellent performers who did sing, while Nikolai Petrovic whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining that the audience still wants to see his father on the show.
But it turns out that is not the case at all, the audience wants an objective assessment and to see really talented performers in the final, and Agutin has now discredited the show.
"I sympathize with the Voice participants from the Agutina team - they were doomed."
"Last time, Agutin showed how he loved his dad, and today he should have shown himself to be a professional."
"The competition has lost its meaning."
"To remove two talented people from the project and leave your dad in the draft who doesn't sing but whispers, how can you name a mentor after that? "
"He's like singing dad, organise him a concert in the Kremlin for his money and see how many people will come to this concert."
It's a Voice show, not a show called Cruel Family.
"It was unprofessional on the part of Agutin."
'Then you have to offer on your own show to speak to your dad, not on a show made for Canal 1's money.'
'it was a real chance for someone and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why a voteless dad should give me more understanding than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why did a worker from Surguta, with a magnificent voice and a themebre, slip and Agutina's dad get to the finals?
And then we all complain that the same faces have been on stage and off screens for decades!
Yes, because you don't get through the cummy! '
'What were you waiting for?
It's Russia!
Circle of bluntness and cummy.
Yes, and the money in the family budget will not be extra!
The theatre of absurdity continues! "
Users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional Voice, Gradsky's son came out on blind auditions.
Then the meter and the head didn't have to take his son to his own team.
What's more, he said, "Come on, get out of here, it's all clear."
Agutin was unable to act as a professional.
Please, when you are ready to take your step.

He noted that one option was the location of a low frequency radio telescope on the back of the moon, which would avoid interference from which the Earth is sourced.
"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to explore space sources of radio radiation," added Petrukovic.
He also believes that the moon could be used to test robotics, to use local resources to build.
In addition, astronauts should be involved in the search for primitive organics on Earth's satellite, according to the scientist.
This could help determine how life appears on the planets.
Previously, the head of the Roscosmos Corporation said that in an optimistic version of the Russian Federation, a piloted flight to the moon could be carried out by 2030.

The offended customer ditched a basket with fecals in store 7 - Eleven
Damian Simms, a 41 - year - old Saint Petersburg (Florida), what is known as "had a tooth" on the manager of the 7 - Eleven network 24 - hour store: in May, he put him out of the store for inappropriate behaviour.
And decided to revenge his enemy in an original way.
At half the second night, he walked into the store and dropped on the floor and on some of the goods on the shelves the contents of the basket brought with him.
There were faeces and urine in the basket that Simms "borrowed" from a nearby mobile biotaulet.
Police officers who arrived at the scene arrested a vigilante.
He was placed in prison and released pending trial on bail of $300.
He was charged with unlawful invasion of other people's property and criminal offences, and was banned from entering the store and approaching the manager.
Although Simms' crime seems rather funny than serious, a court sentence may prove surviving enough because he has repeatedly violated the law before: it includes theft in large sizes, robbery, illegal possession of a weapon, driving a car in a state of infrequency and animal abuse.
He wanted to convince me.. to convince me, Radio Rahima,.. that I would turn off my "box," and shit, man, that he never even said "Please."

The President of the Russian Federation of Tennis (FTP), Shamil Tarpichev, commented on the removal of Moscow's Spartacus footballers Denis Glushkov and Andrea Yeschenko from training with the main composition after a loophole to criticize the team's chief coach, Massimo Carrera, according to the Sport weekend.
Carrera's actions were absolutely absurd.
To pay attention to such things is unsuccessful foolishness.
I absolutely disagree with what Carrera is doing.
This only deepens the discord in the team.
First of all, these are poems, read and perceived as possible.
I would not have reacted to that in the place of Carrera.

Syrian students discussed natural technologies with scientists
Students at the Sirius Education Center in Sochi, participants at the Academy of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists at the National Courchatov Institute Research Centre.
The researchers' presentation took place as part of a programme of the Global International Forum on Convergent and Natural Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the Education Center website on 29 September.
The lecture was opened by a documentary film, Koda Kurchatova, in which the President of the Kurchatova Institute, a member - correspondent of Ran Mikhail Kowalchuk, described global challenges as a driving force for the development of civilization.
The scientist's lecture is published on Sirius's website.
Schoolchildren have learned that modern technology needs a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet capable of producing such volumes.
Tackling this problem, according to the forum's organizers, will be helped by the natural technologies that young scientists are working on today.
In addition, Kowalchuk raised the theme of responsibility for developing natural technologies, and described the risks inherent in the creation of such technologies.
'The advent of such technologies is a unique thing, it is a tremendous good.
This is an explosive growth in medical technology, it is an improvement in quality of life and infrastructure.
But there is also a second side.
The development of natural technologies is actually a technological reproduction of living nature systems.
There is a negotiable side - targeted intervention in human lifestyle.
There are always risks.
A car has emerged - people have begun to bend under the wheels.
But cars are still used.

The candidate for physics - mathematical sciences, the head of the Kurchatova Complex NBC - Natural Related Technologies NICC's Curchatova Institute, Julia Djakova, and the head of the NBC's Curchatological Complex, Vyacheslav Demin, were speakers.
The Sirius Education Center in Sochi has been set up by the Talent and success Education Fund, based on the Olympic infrastructure at the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The aim of the education centre's work is early identification, development and further professional support for gifted children.
Earlier in September, it was reported that the prizers of the Russian online information security Olympics would be sent to Sirius for training.

Macedonia: the referendum was not because of low turnout
The referendum was intended to endorse the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country to Northern Macedonia.
Greece objected to the use by Macedonians of the name of its historic province.
The renaming led the former Yugoslav republic to open its way to NATO and later to the EU.
But, according to the EEFE agency, only 34 per cent of the turnout on Sunday plebiscite "did not reach" the constitutional threshold of 50 per cent.
However, as the referendum was only advisory, perhaps the authorities in Skopje would decide not to rename.
Speaking shortly after the closure of polling stations, Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a supporter of the change in the name of the republic, said that if there were more "yes" among the votes cast, Macedonia would change the name, regardless of the understatement quorum.

Push and please - how is it right?
Words do not exist to suppress.
It's right to be satisfied.
The word "push" in the meaning of "tighten, exert influence, influence" exists only fontically because we hear sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "please."
We use that word, believing it comes from the word "pressure ."
But "pressure" and "to please" are not only close, but even in some ways the opposite.
Make sure of it yourself.
Satisfied (church.-knowing, obsolete) means "quite, complete, sufficient, to be sufficient for anyone or anything to satisfy."
Enjoyment, pleasure - kinky words.
In the past, it still had the importance of "not depending on anything, having a self-satisfied meaning" - "to please yourself."
The old-Slavic "widow nytti" is related to the words "vele" and "will."
Pushing, suppressing is completely different.
These words have truly intimidating "relatives": daos - "wolf" (squeezing sheep), deyja - "die" and dweed - "harass."
The similar background appearance of the words "pressure" and "satisfied," as well as the imminent obsolescence of the latter, forced them into contamination.
So we have this very "d [a] lie" that is also used through "a" on the letter, which is good, wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of the emergence and development of these words.
So it's right to be satisfied.
But this word is obsolete, no longer used in its proper meaning.
If you want to point out that any circumstances / people have a negative impact on you from above, use the word "push."
You can also use the "pressure" design, but remember that it is the office.

Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami: number of casualties rising
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and the tsunami it caused on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi exceeded 400 people.

Vucic left the Serbian army's highest alert level in force.
The President of Serbia, Alexander Vucic, ordered that the country's Armed Forces from the situation in the north of the autonomous province of Kosovo and Metohija be maintained.
"The President ordered that the highest level of alert be maintained, there will be a separate order to lift it," Serbian Minister of Defence Alexander Vulin said on Sunday, the words of which are quoted by the TSA.

Vucic himself said the day before that he intended to discuss the situation in Kosovo and Metohija with Russian President Vladimir Putin and ask the Russian leader for support.
The meeting is reportedly scheduled for 2 October and is due to take place in Moscow.
At the same time, the Serbian leader stressed that he would do everything in his power to maintain peace, and noted that he wished his country to be a peaceful, successful economic, country of the future.

In Germany, 14,000 people went to a demonstration against racism
Some 14,000 people went to a demonstration against racism in the German city of Hamburg.
The action was supported by more than 450 organizations under the slogan "Together Against Racism."
The organizers initially reported that some 30,000 demonstrators would take part in the action, which would call on the authorities to deny the deportation of migrants from the country and stand up to protect people's right to protection and asylum, writes the newspaper Zeit.
The event also stated that the rescue of migrants in the Mediterranean must cease to be an offence.
In addition, the demonstrators demanded the resignation of Horst Zeehofer, the head of the FWG's Ministry of Interior, and the dissolution of the department for the protection of the Constitution.
One participant in the event, Nevros Duman, said that the aim of the demonstration was to show unity of society and solidarity in this problem.

Through Syrian operation, Russia has shielded itself from terrorists.
In three years of Russian military operation in Syria, some 100,000 terrorists have been killed, of which 85,000 terrorists have destroyed the Air Force, the Russian Space Force.
This was described in the wake of the third anniversary of the start of the Russian military operation in Syria by Victor Bondarev, former head of the VX, head of the Federation Council's Defence and Security Committee.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of aerial defeat means: air - space forces have carried out and continue to strike all targets accurately against terrorist targets.
According to Bondarev, tens of thousands of terrorist sites have been destroyed in Syria in three years, such as ammunition warehouses, strongholds and headquarters.
With the help of Russian airstrikes, the jihadists' defence was hacked - which was a crucial contribution to the advancement of Syria's government troops, the Interfax transfers.
In doing so, according to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria has allowed Russia itself to be shielded from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including Islamic State (IG, banned in Russia) and Jebhat - an - Nusru (banned in Russia).
According to the Russian Armed Forces Genstab, some 4,000 fighters from Russian nationals and about 5,000 citizens from post-Soviet countries fought on the IG side, the Tass.
And it is only about recorded individuals, not counting those who have not been identified, Bondarev stressed.
Most of them were trained and ready to take arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to enter our country freely.
Thus, Bondarev noted, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism at the far frontiers - otherwise this evil would "slap towards us."

Mitropolith Ilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename KPCC with fascist actions
The head of the synodical Division of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Mitropolith Ilarion, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists against Jews.
"It is still that in fascist Germany, to pin a yellow sharp star on a Jew, it means to mark the Church as a hostile organization, and it is for this purpose that this bill was created," said the Mitropolith on "Russia - 24" (quote on "Interfax").
He believes that this move will have the most serious consequences just now that the Russian - Ukrainian conflict is in an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to get full control of the KPCC and "put it out of the law," according to the priest.
"This is a Ukrainian church, and believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainian, they are patriots of their country," he added.
It has previously been known that members of the Supreme Leadership are working to implement Bills No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).

The text of his address to the faithful Ukrainian Orthodox Church (УПЦ) was published on Saturday on the site of the occupants.
At different times of history, our predecessors and family on faith and spirit Christians have had to profess their faith and defend their sanctuaries.
Given the situation that has evolved, and the information that we have and the threats of massacres that are spreading, it is evident that we will also have to survive something, " said the Mitropolith.
He asked for support - prayer, moral.
The lurid hint also stressed that it would probably "need your physical presence."
The priest added: "Lenin's grandchildren are in spirit, threaten to be massacred and therefore protect their sanctuary."
Who doesn't care about the fate of the Pachaean Lavre, the Orthodox Ukrainian and the world sanctuary, must be prepared to protect it, is said in the address.
Mitropolith has called for not to go about those who mislead believers.
Упtz has canonical status defined by Tomos of 29 October 1990 from Mother of the Church.
And now someone wants to be addicted to the news patriarch and a friend of the Catholic Pope's Roman Varfollum.
A new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us.
And we are pleased with the status that our church has, " the lurid hint noted.
He recalled that the Dawc has been canonically independent and fully independent in its governance since October 1990.
There is no administrative - financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchy.
In fact, Tomos already has our church.
What else do we need Tomos? "- noted the Mitropolith of the Pochayevsky Vladimir, calling on believers and all citizens to ask whether other Tomos faiths have them independent from the Vatican?

The main Macedonian opposition refused to vote in the referendum
Macedonia holds a referendum on the issue of an intergovernmental treaty with Greece to rename the Republic of Macedonia on Sunday, 30 September.
Citizens are asked to answer one question: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Greece?"
Nevertheless, the leader of the leading opposition party, "The Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - the Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity" (wmrp - DPMne), Christian Mickoski, said there would be no vote in the referendum.
As explained by the party's press secretary, Naum Stoilkovsky, Mitzkoski decided to abstain from voting to express his dissent with a treaty that deemed "damaging."
According to the press secretary, the current referendum resolves the issue of renaming the country, and no more, while the party's strategic goal is to achieve NATO and EU membership.
A week ago, Macedonian President George Ivanov also refused to participate in the referendum on 30 September.
He explained that the name for the country he chose 27 years ago in the referendum on independence.The Macedonian leader considers renaming the country a negative factor.
"a new semi-sovereign state with a new name is being created," Ivanov noted.
The agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav republic, the Republic of Northern Macedonia, was signed by the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Macedonia and Greece on 17 June this year during a solemn ceremony on the shores of Lake Prespa, on which the border between the two countries takes place.
This treaty should resolve a yearslong dispute over the country's name, as well as Skopje's path to NATO and the EU, Tass recalls.

U.S. hosts an increase in opiate production in Afghanistan
There was much talk in Tehran about the dramatic worsening of the situation in Afghanistan on 26 September.
There were multilateral consultations involving Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, represented by the Secretary of the Security Council, Nicolas Patrushev.
In fact, in Afghan territory, militants have launched a genuine terrorist war against the country's state authorities and the civilian population.
The current year has been a record in the number of bloody attacks that have killed thousands of ordinary Afghans, " Patrushev noted.
Afghanistan's troubles began far from yesterday.
After the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001, Al-Qaida (banned in the Russian Federation), a terrorist group that has been seized in Afghanistan, was declared the main enemy of the United States.
It hasn't been a month since America and NATO allies launched a "Insurmountable Freedom" military operation there.
It's been 17 years.
A multiyear American contingent and now on Afghan soil.
And peace life is even more ghostly than it was then.
U.S. troops are inundated for fences of dozens of their bases.
As they can, they're being paid off by militants for money - only if they weren't touched.
The Government of Afghanistan controls a smaller portion of the country's territory - 40 per cent, according to Patrusheva.
50 per cent of the Taliban (banned in the Russian Federation).
Another 10 per cent is for ISIS terrorists (banned in the Russian Federation).
However, they are growing rapidly there.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia - exactly what they did not get in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be comfortable with that.
It is also fitting that in the 17 years of the American presence, drug production (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times.
A tremendous increase in areas planted with opium poppy and multimillion gains.

Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum to join the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the country's name.
The agreement to rename the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia to the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on 17 June as the outcome of long negotiations with neighbouring Greece, which refused to recognize its northern neighbour's right to be known as Macedonia, seeing in that name an assassination attempt on a single Greek province and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovsky, a political scientist: "Because of this agreement, Macedonia or Northern Macedonia is entitled to a better future, hope for public change.
And Greece will enshrine the right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They emerge as a result of difficult compromises cannot make absolutely everyone happy. "
The country's rename is advocated by the ruling Social Democrats, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
The anti - conservative opposition and the President of the country, George Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetina Chilemanova, Macedonia has no point in joining the EU - enough to have a partnership with it: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government, led by Zaev, is inflicted from outside to change the name of the country.
But that decision would have negative consequences.
First and foremost, the loss of sovereignty.
Clearly, there are countries that would not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans. "

The choice that Macedonian citizens will make will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but of Europe as a whole. "

Sands responded to a question about Serbia's possible support for Kosovo
The press secretary of the President of Russia, Dmitry Peskov, believes it is premature to say whether Russia will provide assistance to Serbia after the escalation in Kosovo.
He said that negotiations between the leaders of the two countries should take place first.
That's what the Kremlin spokesman told the journalists of the Govorit Moscow radio station on Sunday, 30 September.
On 29 September, Serbian resident Alexander Vucic announced that he intended to discuss the situation in Kosovo with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the nearest meeting in Moscow on 2 October.
The Serbian leader also planned to ask for Moscow's support in the current situation, clarifying that military assistance was not being addressed in this case.
Vucic noted that he wished to keep peace in the region and intended to do whatever was necessary to do so.
Earlier on the same day, it became known that the President of Serbia ordered the country's armed forces to be brought to a state of high alert.
