Head of the British Mfa compared the EU with the Soviet Union and prison
British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt compared the EU with the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of taking the members of the community into captivity.
The diplomat made this statement at the Congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, September 30.
As the Daily Mail notes, in this way, Hunt commented on the difficulties in the negotiation process on Brexit.
What happened to the belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not let anyone leave it.

He also added that attempts to punish the British for the decision to withdraw from the EU will only exacerbate the crisis, "Gazeta. Ru" notes.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Teresa Mae said the Brexit talks had stalled.
So she commented on the results of the informal EU summit in Salzburg.

The United Kingdom's withdrawal is expected to take place before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by many factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
In addition, an open question remains on the Irish border.

Telegram users complained about the failure of the new version
IPhone users complained about the Telegram Messenger problem after the September 28 update.
You can find the user's phone number
The complaints concern gadgets with the current iOS 12 operating system.
According to their owners, after the update the application shows a white screen or immediately closes.
The Messenger representatives reacted to the failure.
According to them, the problem may be related to the migration of information to a new application written in the Swift language.
Telegram temporarily suspended the application's automatic update before troubleshooting.
On April 13, the Taganrog Court of Moscow granted Roscomnadzor's claim to block Telegram's messenger in Russia.
Three days later, the telecom operators began to implement the decision.
The reason for this was the refusal of the Messenger administration to provide the FSB with the keys to decrypt the correspondence needed to obtain data on terrorists.
In August, Telegram changed the privacy policy and agreed to disclose the IP address and mobile phone number of the suspected terrorist to the user upon receipt of the relevant judgment.
The audience of Telegram after the blockage in RUSSIA decreased by 1.2 million

The discovery of penicillin marked the beginning of the era of modern antibiotics, brought Fleming worldwide fame and made him a Nobel laureate.

Trump told about "Love" in Kim Jong Eun
From the mutual cruelty of the leaders of the United States and North Korea reached almost to love each other, joked Donald Trump.
U.S. President Donald Trump has noted a successful joke about his successes on the front of the settlement of the North Korean crisis.
Starting with the mutual threats of destruction, now the leaders of the two countries have so adjusted relations that are almost in love with each other, said the American president.
The owner of the White House recalled that he took the North Korean problem from the previous administration as the main complication in foreign policy.
Trump noted that the team of Barack Obama has so launched a relationship with the DPRK that could not even reach the leadership of the country-there simply did not pick up the phone.
Then the U.S. and North Korea were on the verge of war, and today the North Korean leader writes to the White House "beautiful letters," said Trump.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work too "was cruel" to Kim Jong-ynu, which, however, was mutual.
But now their relationship has been dealt with so much that the leaders "fell in love each other".
At the same time Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the American MEDIA misunderstand them as incompetence.
Trump drew attention to the fact that recently Pyongyang has stopped nuclear and missile testing, as well as closing military polygons.
All these are merits of the work of his administration, the American president is sure.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump praised Kim Jong-yun from the rostrum of the U.N. General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for the courage and steps taken to de-escalate tensions.
Trump noted that the sanctions against the DPRK will remain until the full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
Negotiations in Singapore
On June 12, Singapore held the first ever talks between U.S. and North Korean leaders.
After a serious aggravation of relations and mutual threats of the use of nuclear weapons, the summit looked like a fracture in the protracted U.S.-Korean crisis.
Following the negotiations, the Parties expressed their intention to move towards a peaceful resolution of the contradictions, although they did not take any legal obligations.
The positive outcome of the meeting was the cessation of nuclear and missile tests of the DPRK, as well as the return to the U.S. remains of American soldiers in the country.
At the same time, other practical steps towards the denuclearization of North Korea are still slipping away.
The MEDIA reported that after the Singapore Summit, the United States had sent several disarmament scenarios to the DPRK, but Pyongyang rejected them, calling them "Gangsterian".

Nice called to oust the "Moscow language Ukrainian product"
Ukrainian children's writer and a fighter for the purity of her native language Larisa Nitoy called to oust from Ukraine "Russian-speaking Moscow product and the Moscow language".

His thoughts on "expediency of elimination of the Russian language in Ukraine" was shared with Ukrainian edition "columnist".

At the same time, according to Nietzsche, Ukrainians do not apply aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language, in its opinion, are only "widening of the borders for the Ukrainian speech at the legislative level".
Previously Nice shared the experience of maintaining the "Ukrainian-language regime" in a children's camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened to court a chain of Watsons bookstores, one of whom was in contact with her at the Russian.
Not having achieved the, Nietzsche threw in a girl change.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians she calls "language schizophrenia", urging Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in the spelling of surnames.
Recently, Nietzsche said that the name "Rus" was stolen from Ukrainians, so that Russia should be called Muscovy.
The anger of the writer could not be avoided even by the security service of Ukraine: Having come there and hearing the conversations of the employees with each other in Russian, she took a scandal and left, slamming the door.

"If we carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the speech of the foreign Minister of Germany, I do not take Ukraine, Georgia, or British, in any case, the choir was not absolutely accurate,"-drew the attention of the politician, Noticing that Russia "was no longer a wall, which is being coached by tennis ball."
The head of the Sovfea Profile Committee does not rule out that this is indicative of a trend which, in his view, "will highlight the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although this trend may be manifested in a year, two or three."
"I do not rule out that the current session may in some sense be a turning point," Kosachev admitted, explaining that "there are too many examples of how Russia can move forward in international affairs".
He cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea as an example.
"While it is unfortunately not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time,"-the MP added.
This is due to the fact, he believes, that there is an "adequate, sensible perception of Russia as not just possible-an integral participant in the solution of global problems of the present".
"I would not like to make a mistake, but I have a feeling that we are somewhere passing a point, for which the movement will no longer be reversed, it will be moving forward,"-he added.
Another "interesting and important sensation" in this context Kosachev called "a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop".
"I attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I was very pleased to see that if a year or two or five years ago the Russian opinion, Russian vision of what is happening in the world, by and large, no one was interested in, now the situation is different, "-said the chairman of the Committee Sovfea.
In his opinion, this is due to the fact that "the so-called new liberal order, which embodies the West, there are no answers to the questions, how to solve the world problems because of the obvious lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas about How to solve the problems of the Middle East, problems of terrorism, problems of non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, problems of migration ".
"And here the request for Russian vision becomes more and more obvious," Kosachev expressed his confidence, stressing that in this sense "the current session is successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia".

ADG became the second most popular in Germany
Anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" beats another record of popularity, and the ratings of Angela Merkel fall.
It seems that German residents began to seriously tire of the immigration policy of Angela Merkel, which has made the country a cherished target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
The most obvious of all is the latest sociological polls, according to which the anti-immigrant party "Alternative for Germany" is becoming more popular, and the positions of the ruling bloc Merkel and zeehofer are weakening.
This week, the ADG beat another record, rising to the second place in the rating of people's sympathies.
Right-wing conservatives with 17 percent of popularity managed to bypass the Social Democrats, who have about 16 percent.
The gap in one percentage point can be written off on statistical error, but it should be noted the fact that the ADG created in 2013, from a small group of economists-Euroskeptics, has become a serious political force.
Leadership in the overall standings continues to hold the ruling block of CSU/CDU, which has about 30 percent.
However, the trend towards loss of points is visible-back in April the support of Angela Merkel's block was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is declining.
Today in support of Angela Merkel are 48 percent of Germans, which is 7 percent lower than last year.
Let's add that following the Social Democrats settled "green" (15%), left (11%) and Liberals (10%).
The evolution of "alternatives"
The "Alternative for Germany" party was established in September 2012 on the basis of the group "alternative Choice 2013", which included the descendants of the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially stood in opposition to the government's course, but at first it dealt only with economic issues, including the problems of the euro and the interaction within the EU.
At the same time, the group opposed the "sponsorship" by Germany of weak EU economies, did not exclude the possibility of a return to the German mark and the full withdrawal of the country from the European Union.
Amid the deepening of the immigration crisis, the political platform of the ADG has expanded.
In 2013, the band formed a full-fledged party that took the niche of Euroskeptics and began to harshly criticize the government for failing immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the ADG managed to break into the Bundestag for the first time, having received 94 seats (from 709).
Two representatives of the "Alternative for Germany" get seats in the European Parliament.

Term of death of the universe is named
The universe will last approximately 140 billion years, which is ten times the age of the observed world, equal to about 13.8 billion years.
The research of the international team of scientists is published in the Library of electronic preprints arXiv.org and is directed to publication in magazine Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun informs.
To such conclusions experts have come, observing with the help of the camera HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) of the telescope Subaru for approximately ten millions galaxies.
Investigating the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 percent of the energy-mass of the observed world, scientists, working within the standard cosmological model ΛCDM (Λ Cold Dark Matter), estimated the pace of expansion of the universe, Which was slightly slower than previously thought.
The Subaru Observatory's press release notes that observations have resulted in a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, and the Planck of the European Space Telescope has clarified the limitations imposed on ΛCDM parameters.
In July, scientists modeled the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new arguments that the observed world would cease to exist after 22 billion years as a result of the big divide.
So, even if I persuaded you to do something, sometimes it is difficult to get as a result some action.
Everything that exists in the world is only a dream.
Another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum failed
Opportunity to know people's opinion about pension reform postponed indefinitely
A meeting of the Federal Initiative Group of the referendum against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups that have registered different wording of the issues (the Central Election Commission has registered five formulations).
They decided to apply to the CEC for registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians the question: "You for the fact that the legislation on pension provision as of July 1, 2018, the age at which citizens Russia get the right to appoint an old-age pension, did not increase? "
This wording was registered by the Vologda subgroup, the representatives of which did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered to be the simplest and legally capacious.
The majority of the participants of the meeting were supporters of the member of "Fair Russia" Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and the CPRF (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups-from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Sviridov previously told "statements" that invitations were sent to all initiators, and representatives of about 40 subgroups expressed their consent to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who heads the Vologda subgroup (her wording was supported by 15 more subgroups), said "statements" that the invitations were not received and did not plan to come: "We did not understand who is a friend and who is the enemy."

In the match "Loko"-"Ahmat" errors turbine raining down as from the Horn of Abundance
Former judge of the All-Union category Vladimir Levatin commented on the work of referee Evgeny Turdin in the match of the 9th round of the Russian championship "Lokomotiv"-"Ahmat" and disassembled the controversial episodes of the game.
-How do you evaluate the refereeing of Evgeny Turin in the match "Lokomotiv"-"Ahmat"?
-I believe that this referee confirmed his unsuitability to the refereeing of matches of the Russian Premier League.
I am surprised that the heads in the meeting of the fifth round of "Spartak"-"dynamo", neither turbines nor the leaders of the DSI did not make serious conclusions about his low qualification.
The result was not slowed down in the ninth round: mistakes in his actions, private passes of coarse receptions raining down as from the Horn of abundance.
For example, on the 50th minute of the Raillander Eder floods with the help of hands in his penalty area defender "Akhmat" Rodolfo.
The gate is eight meters away, but the turbine does not put a penalty.
-How do you estimate the episode with the participation of Idov, who was in 82 minutes, when it seemed that the ball hit him in the hand?
-I believe that here was the deliberate play of the defender's hand in its penalty area.
The turbine was next to the moment, well sees this episode and its first assistant on the right.
This moment was to be seen by the reserve Judge Sergey Karasev.
However, all three slept, and the penalty was not assigned.
Therefore, the score in the match is distorted, and sports justice was trampled.
This was the case when the judging by the notions superseded and buried the sports spirit of the game.
-On 52 minutes of the turbine did not dare to remove the defender of the guests Oleg Ivanov, who broke the rules in the fight against Kryhovykom, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, defiantly applauded him.
What do you think about this episode?
Did you have to show the second mustard?
-In this moment the turbines and the first yellow card showed not quite on the case.
The second would be illogical.
-Oleg Ivanov said after the match about the double standards of refereeing that some teams put a penalty for such violations, as in the episode with Idov, and somehow not.
What is the player's words?
-Depending on what to understand under double standards.
There was a penalty.
He was not given.
So the referee does not give the second penalty to the opposite gate.
Here is the principle that is used.
And the second point of double standards is that the referee is watching who is playing.
Here played on Saturday "Lokomotiv" and "Akhmat" have serious claims to the work of Turin because the team was infringed.
-The man changed sex, became a lesbian. One minute.
To his great delight, his team won the game.

Matt Damon played accused of raping Judge Cavanaugh at the start of SNL
American actor Matt Damon played the U.S. Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh, who is charged with rape.
Damon appeared in the first release of the new season of Saturday Night Live broadcast on NBC TV.
During a small sketch, the actor played Kavano at a Senate hearing on charges of rape.
The U.S. Supreme Court candidate has previously drawn attention to his emotionless and detailed stories during a conversation with Senator Amy Klobushar.
Thus, Kavano repeatedly confessed his love for beer, but said that he had never been drunk to unconsciousness.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on charges of rape, Kavano claimed that in those years he was a virgin.
These moments also defeated Damon.
All I did was drink a lot and never think about sex.
I was the most proud, most drunken virgin anyone has ever seen.
Everyone is familiar with it, "said the judge in the performance of Matt Damon.
Kavano was previously elected US Supreme judge.
But pay attention to the face and body language of everyone who is present on this fuzzy picture, and you feel that they all play.
But my advice to you is to tell them that you behaved badly and fled, and apologize.
Nothing, this is a football game against Afula, we won, although the judge was a Jew.
Barbra Streisand discovered in her cloned canine oddities in behavior
American singer Barbra Streisand said that the clones of her dead dog behave quite differently than the original pet.
"They are not alike.
In fact, [clones] look like her, but it is impossible to clone the soul, "-said the 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of his 14-year-old Koton de Tulaar dog named Samantha, who had to be euthanize because of health problems.
In July 2018 it was reported that the dog of the Chihuahua breed named Miracle-Milli (Miracle Milly), which was named the smallest dog in the world, was cloned in the 49-th time.
Specialists are engaged in cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
US to think about Russia's naval blockade due to oil and gas supplies
In the U.S. can start a naval blockade of Russia to gain an advantage in the global energy market.
The American authorities have been so zealously in the struggle for success in the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to the sea blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world's major suppliers of energy.
The head of the US Interior ministry Ryan Zinke told about the possibility of the naval blockade.
Contrary to world practice, the American Ministry of the Interior is not a police officer, but a civilian function, including a natural resource policy.
That's why Zinke's statement came out entirely in the competence of his department, though it was not devoid of political color.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that the U.S. naval forces control the sea routes in the Middle East region and can block them if necessary.
Zinke's words suggested that the need could be related to Washington's desire to prevent Russian supplies to the global energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia still receives the lion's share of its revenues from supplies to the global oil and gas market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East, as in Eastern Europe, was the main motive for Moscow's revitalization in the region, Zinke believes.
The minister made it clear that the United States still expects to provide leadership in the global energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do this, Washington will have to push Russia and Iran, and the sea blockade of trade routes-an acceptable measure along the way, Zinke said.
"I have come to tell you that I am going to Moscow tomorrow and will not return to this House again, and you shall have the news of my decision through the lawyer to whom I will entrust the case of divorce.

"It's a hideous nepotism"
The audience is outraged by the choice of Agutin on the show "Voice"
Spectators of the show "Voice 60 +" accuse the mentor Leonid Agutin of "ugly nepotism and brazen manipulation".
When in the blind auditions he from the first notes learned the voice of his father Nikolay Aguutin many hoped that he would remain neutral and would not turn to the performer.
But the sons of the senses took the upper hand, and he chose a relative to his team.
Then many considered it a joke, but forgiven the mentor bias in the first stage.
But the "joke" dragged on, and the father of the star absolutely unjustifiably took the place of more deserving performers.
And now the spectators are not ready to forgive Agustou such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the audience of the show, resented the nepotism of the ugly and frank dragging of their close relatives to the final staircase.
I have even doubted that Agustou will have enough strength and conscience not to drag to the end of his dad quite already to the first place, "-said Irina Petrovsky and Ksenia Larina in the program" Man of the TV ".
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father Leonid Agutin "leaked" the beautiful performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining it to the fact that the audience and further want to see in the show of his father.
But, as it turned out, it is not so, viewers want objective evaluation and see in the finals really talented performers, and now Aguutin discredited the show.
"I sympathize with the participants of the" voices "from the Agutin team-they were doomed."
"Last time Agutin showed how he loved dad, and today he had to show himself a professional."
"The contest has lost its meaning."
"Remove from the project two talented people and leave in the project of his father who does not sing but whispers, how can you then call the mentor?",
"Like Dad sings, organize a concert in the Kremlin for your money and see how many people will come to this concert."
It's the voice show, not the cool cousins show.
"From the side of Agutin it was unprofessional."
"Then it is necessary on the own show to offer to speak to the pope, instead of on a show which is made for money of 1 channel".
"It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I do not understand why a voiceless pope should cause me to understand more than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why was the worker from Surgut with a magnificent voice and timbre drained, and father Agustina brought to the finals?
And then we all complain that on stage and from screens the same faces for decades!
Yes, because I can't get through the nepotism! "

Then the meter and the head did not come to take the son in his own team.
What's more, he said, "Come on, get out of here, all clear."
Agutin did not do as a professional.
Please when you're ready to make your move.

Students learned that modern technology needs a lot of energy.
Alternative energy to develop such volumes is not yet capable.
To solve this problem, according to the organizers of the Forum, will help the nature-like technologies that young scientists are working on today.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of environmental technologies, as well as described the risks that inevitably arise in the creation of such technologies.
"The advent of such technologies is a unique thing, it is a colossal blessing.
This is an explosive growth of medical technology, it is an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there is a second side.
The development of nature-like technologies actually has a technological reproduction of wildlife systems.
There is a downside-purposeful intervention in the livelihoods of the person.
There are always risks.
A car appeared-people began to die under the wheels.
But cars still use.

Macedonia: Referendum not held due to low turnout
The referendum was intended to endorse the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country to "northern Macedonia".
Greece objected to the use by the Macedonians of the name of their historical province.
The renaming of the former Yugoslav Republic has narrowed the way to NATO and later to the EU.
But, as the agency EFÉ informs, only 34% of the turnout on Sunday plebiscite "did not reach" to the constitutional threshold of 50%.
However, since the referendum was only of a consultative nature, the authorities in Skopje might decide not to abandon the renaming.
Speaking shortly after the closure of the polling stations, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a supporter of changing the name of the Republic, said that if the votes cast would be greater than "yes", Macedonia would replace the name despite Unreachable quorum.

What's the right thing to do?
There is no word for it.
That's right.
The word "to press" in the meaning "to gravitate, to exert influence, to effect" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of the word "cheer".
We use that word in the belief that it comes from the word "pressure".
But "pressure" and "to cheer up" etymologically not only not close, but even in some sense are opposite.
Make sure you do it yourself.
To Dowst (Tserk.-book, outdated) means "enough, full, sufficient, to be sufficient for someone or something, to satisfy".
Settle for, pleasure-related words.
Previously, he still had the meaning of "not to depend on anything, to have a self-reliant value"-to "cheer himself".
The old Slavic "Dovlѣti" is related to the words "to be told" and "will".
To crush, to suppress-completely other.
These words are truly frightening "relatives": Daos-"wolf" (pressing sheep), Deyja-"die" and Dvaidī-"oppress".
The similar phonetic appearance of the words "pressure" and "cheer", as well as the inevitable obsolescence of the latter, forced them to enter into contamination.
So we have this very "D [a] volder", which is also used in the letter "A", which, in a good, wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of the emergence and development of these words.
Well, that's right.
But this word is obsolete, in its proper meaning is no longer used.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people have negative influence on you, use the word "press".
You can also use the "exert pressure" design, but remember that it is clerical.

Remains of missing 47 years ago a pilot of the USSR discovered in the jungle of Vietnam
In Vietnam, the remains of a supposedly Soviet military pilot Yuri Poyarkov, who disappeared 47 years ago, were discovered.

With an operation in Syria, Russia has robbed itself of terrorists
During three years of the Russian military operation in Syria about 100 thousand terrorists have been killed, from them 85 thousand terrorists have destroyed air-space forces of the Russian Federation.
This was explained in connection with the third anniversary of the beginning of the Russian military operation in Syria, the former chief of the VKS, head of the Federation Council Committee on Defense and Security Viktor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of means of air damage: Aerospace forces have applied and continue to inflict all strikes exactly on the objects of terrorists.
According to Bondareva, tens of thousands of terrorist objects have been destroyed in Syria in three years, such as ammunition depots, fortifications and headquarters.
With the help of Russian airstrikes, the defense of jihadists was hacked-it was a decisive contribution to the promotion of Syrian government troops, Interfax informs.
In this case, according to Bondareva, the operation of our military in Syria allowed to protect Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the "Islamic State" (IG, banned in Russia) and "jehat-en-Nusra" (banned in Russia).
According to the general Staff of the armed Forces of the Russian Federation, on the side of IG fought about four thousand militants from among Russian citizens and about five thousand citizens of the post-Soviet countries, TASS reports.
And it is only about the registered persons, not counting those who were not identified, said Bondarev.
Most of them were trained and ready to take arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter the territory of our country.
Thus, said Bondarev, in Syria Russia fights against international terrorism on distant forefront-otherwise this evil "would have poured to us".

Syria accuses US of supporting terrorism
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem accused the United States and its partners of war crimes in Syria and the support of terrorism.
[The Western] coalition completely destroyed the Syrian city of Rakka, destroying the infrastructure and public services in the areas against which it was directed, and committed massacres of civilians, including children and women.
These murders under international law are war crimes, "he said.
According to Muallema, the United States and its partners provided "direct support to the terrorists", as the targets of the militants and the western coalition in Syria coincided and implied "the sowing of Chaos, death and destruction in its path".

More than 10 million Syrians have been refugees since the outbreak of the armed conflict that has been going on in Syria for seven years.
About five million people fled to other countries, primarily to neighboring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
Now, in Damascus's view, the hostilities are nearing completion and the country is ready for the voluntary return of the refugees.
This was stated by the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem, speaking to the UN: "The situation on the ground has now become more stable and secure thanks to the successes achieved in the fight against terrorism.
The Government continues to rebuild its work in the areas destroyed by the terrorists, returning them to normal life.
All conditions had been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to a country which they had had to abandon because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions, which had made life difficult for people and deprived them of their livelihood.
The Syrian authorities have also called on the world community to facilitate the return of refugees and to allocate funds.
Meanwhile, the US and EU countries are refusing to provide assistance to Syria, arguing that a political solution to the conflict must first be found.

Metropolitan Hilarion compared the decision of Kyiv to rename UOC-with the actions of Fascists
The head of the Synodal Department of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church metropolitan Hilarion compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists against the Jews.
"It is like that in fascist Germany on the Jew to put a yellow pointed star, it means to mark the church as an enemy organization, and it was for this purpose was created this bill,"-said the metropolitan on the air of the TV channel "Russia-24" (Quote on "Interfax").
In his opinion, this step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is in an acute stage.
Kyiv thus hopes to get full control over the UOC-and "put it outside the law", believes the cleric.
"This is a Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country,"-he added.
Earlier it became known that deputies of Verkhovna Rada are working on implementation of Bills № 4128 (on change of subordination of religious communities), № 4511 (on special status of Religious organizations) and № 5309 (on change of name of religious organizations).
The latter involves renaming the UOC-of the Moscow Patriarchate.
When the plan appeared, it was surprisingly simple and straightforward.

Governor Pochaevskaya Lavra called for the protection of orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
Metropolitan Vladimir, the Governor of the Holy Dormition Pochaevskaya Lavra, made an appeal to protect the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his appeal to the believers of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC-) was published on Saturday at the monastery site.
At different times of history, our predecessors and their native faith and spirit Christians had to profess their faith and defend their shrines.
Given the situation that has developed and the information we have, and the threats of the massacres that are spreading, we can see that we will have to endure something, "the metropolitan said.
He asked for support-prayer, moral.
Also governor Laurels stressed that probably "will need your physical presence".
The priest added: "The grandchildren of Lenin-in spirit, threaten the massacre, and therefore protect their shrine."
Who cares about the fate of the Pochaev Lavra-Orthodox Ukrainian and world shrine, we must be ready to protect it, says the address.
The metropolitan called not to go on the occasion of those who mislead the believers.
UOC-has the canonical status defined by Tomom on 29 October 1990 from the mother of the church.
And now someone wants to be addicted to the Novostilnogo patriarch and friend of the Catholic pope Varfolomey.
The new style with its consequences to US Orthodox is unacceptable.
And we are pleased with the status that our church has, "-said Governor Lavra.
He recalled that UOC-since October 1990 is canonically Independent and completely independent in its management.
There is no administrative and financial accountability for the Moscow Patriarchate.
Actually Tomis our church already has.
What kind of tomus do we need? "said metropolitan Vladimir Pochaevsky, urging believers and all citizens to ask whether other faiths have Tomis, are they independent from the Vatican?
Believers in some measure understand and decided, in what temple to them to walk.
But someone wants to sow enmity and discord again.
Some people seize envy that shine domes on temples which they want to destroy, "-the priest emphasized.
Pochaevskaya Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in western Ukraine.
The Lavra is located on the top of Pochaev Mountain, in 70 kilometers from Ternopil.
The first historical information about it belongs to the beginning of XIII century.

U.S. arranges opium production growth in Afghanistan
There was a lot of talk in Tehran about the sharp aggravation of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26.
There were multilateral consultations with the participation of Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, which was represented by the Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patyshev.
In fact, in Afghan territory, militants unleashed a real terrorist war against state authorities and the civilian population of the country.
The current year has been a record in the number of bloody terrorist attacks, which killed thousands of ordinary Afghans, "-said Patyshev.
The troubles of Afghanistan started far from yesterday.
After the attacks of September 11, 2001, the main enemy of the United States was declared the terrorist group al-Qaida (banned in RUSSIA), planted in Afghanistan.
It has not been a month since America and NATO allies launched a military operation Enduring Freedom.
It's been 17 years.
Thousands of American contingent and now on Afghan soil.
And a peaceful life is even more ghostly than at that time.
American troops are driven behind the fences of dozens of their bases.
How can they be redeemed from militants for money-just not to be touched.
The Government of Afghanistan controls a smaller part of the country-percent 40%, according to Patrushev.
50% of the Taliban (banned in RUSSIA).
Another 10%-for ISIS terrorists (banned in RUSSIA).
But they are growing there fast.
The goal-to create a barbaric pseinhale in Central Asia-exactly the one that has not turned out in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be comfortable with it.
What is also satisfied is that over the 17 years of American presence, the production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times.
Huge growth of areas planted with opium poppy and multi-billion profits.

The Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on joining the EU and NATO, provided the country name is changed.
The agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of northern Macedonia was reached on 17 June as a result of long negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize its northern neighbour as a right to be called Macedonia, seeing in such a title an attempt on the Greek province of the same name and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovsky, political analyst: "Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or northern Macedonia is entitled to a better future, a hope for social change.
And Greece will consolidate the right to its past.
There are no ideal agreements.
They arise as a result of difficult compromises can not make everyone happy. "
For renaming the country are the ruling Social Democrats, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
Against-conservative opposition and president of the country Gheorghe Ivanov.
According to the journalist Tsvetin Chilmanova, Macedonia does not make sense to join the EU-it is enough to have a partnership with him: "Many of those who do not like the agreement, believe that the current socialist government, led by Zaev imposed from outside with the fact To change the country name.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
It is obvious that there are countries that would not want Macedonia to remain a sovereign country in the Balkans. "
Fay Dulgeri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the biggest challenge in its history.
