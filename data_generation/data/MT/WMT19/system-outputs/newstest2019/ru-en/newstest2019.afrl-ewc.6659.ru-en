The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not let anyone leave it.

Head of the Altai Village Council stopped hunger strike in defence of the interests of residents
The deputy said on his Facebook page that he stopped starving for several reasons.
The head of the village council said that the situation has reached a deadlock, the district administration does not respond to its demands, and it needs to carry out its work.
In addition, the prosecutor's office began to check the situation, and the heat supply organization STPC promised to start work on preparing the system for the winter heating period in the village of Siberian next week.
Also, residents of the village council made and took away the governor of the Altai Territory a mass collective appeal "concerning the current catastrophic situation."
Boronin himself said he feels normal, and fully performed his duties as head during the hunger strike.
As Boronin explained, the villages of Siberian and Rogulich have centralized heat supply systems, and therefore the authorities for their preparation for the winter should be exercised by the administration of the Pervomaisk district.
However, until now, no one has started these works.
The head of the village council also protested against the lack of proper control and support from the government of the Altai Territory and against the financial policy of Gazprom Interregiongas Novosibirsk.
In addition to the proper preparation of the villages for the winter, Boronin demanded "to immediately organize a full-fledged, independent communal area in the territory of the municipality, with appropriate staff units."

Ilon Musk is forced to leave the position of head of the board of directors of Tesla
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the founder of Tesla, Ilon Mask, settled their dispute in the fraud case.
CNBC News reports about this.
According to the TV channel, within the framework of the agreements reached, Maska will have to leave the position of head of the board of directors of Tesla.
At the same time, the commission allowed Maska to retain the position of head of Tesla.
As noted, the founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
The same amount will be recovered from Tesla.
At the same time, the money will be distributed among the affected investors.
Furthermore, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Ilon Musk is an American entrepreneur who is included in the list of 50 wealthiest people of the planet according to the Forbes magazine.
He is the head of SpaceX's space corporation, Neuralink's neurotheology company, and Tesla's electric vehicle developer, as well as Paypal's co-founder.

Last month, Mask announced plans to make Tesla a private company and redeem all shares on the stock exchange at a fixed price of $420.
The share price of $420 was set allegedly "from-for the importance of this number in the culture of marijuana," reported earlier Bloomberg agency citing co-director of the security department of the commission Stephen Peikin.
Moreover, Ilon Musk subsequently declined his plans to redeem the shares.
Commenting on the lawsuit filed against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman said he considers the allegations of fraud to be unfounded and added that he is very disappointed and saddened by these claims.
"Honesty is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I did not violate it in any way," the businessman said in an interview with CNBC.
Moreover, in August, Tesla's shareholders group filed a collective lawsuit against Maska, complaining about the financial losses suffered.
The Estonians claimed that the posts of the businessman had brought them losses.
In particular, one of the shareholders said the businessman's tweets were misleading from-for which Tesla shares sellers were forced to purchase papers at artificially inflated prices to cover their positions.
Other claimants also noted that Ilon Maska's negligent remarks resulted in sharp fluctuations in the course.
In September, Ilona Maska accused the head of the research company Citron Research of the stock exchange's fraud.
Meanwhile, if Musk were not able to settle his dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, he would have been threatened with being removed from the company's management and even a prison.
In particular, former chairman of the commission, Harvey Pitt, told CNBC TV about this.
Musk is "a good guy who doesn't know how to run a car company."

Trump spoke about "love" in Kim Jong-un
From mutual cruelty, the leaders of the US and the DPRK reached almost one another's love, Donald Trump joked.
US President Donald Trump has been a good joke about his successes on the front of resolving the North Korean crisis.
Having started with mutual threats of destruction, now the leaders of the two countries have corrected relations so much that they hardly fall in love with each other, the American president noted.
The White House owner recalled that he had accepted the North Korean problem from the previous administration as the main difficulty in foreign policy.
Trump noted that Barack Obama's team has so launched relations with the DPRK that it could not even call the country's leadership - they simply didn't shoot the tube there.
Then the US and the DPRK were on the threshold of the war, and today the North Korean leader writes to the White House "excellent letters," Trump noted.
Trump admitted that Kim Jong-un was also "brutal" at the start of his work, which, however, was reciprocal.
However, now their relations have recovered to the extent that the leaders "fell in love with each other."
In doing so, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the American media will drag them down as incompetence.
Trump pointed out that Pyongyang has recently ceased nuclear and missile testing, as well as closed military ranges.
All of this is the service of his administration, the American president is sure.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump loudly complained about Kim Jong-un from the rostrum of the UN General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for the courage and steps taken to de-escalate tensions.
Meanwhile, Trump noted that sanctions against the DPRK will continue until the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
Conspiracy in Singapore
On June 12, Singapore hosted the first ever talks between US and North Korean leaders.
After a serious worsening of relations and mutual threats of the use of nuclear weapons, the summit looked like a fracture in a protracted Americano-Korean crisis.
Following the results of the negotiations, the parties expressed their intention to move towards a peaceful resolution of the contradictions, although they did not undertake any legal obligations.
The results of the meeting were the cessation of nuclear and missile tests by the DPRK, as well as the return in the United States of the remains of American soldiers stationed in the country.
On the other hand, other practical steps towards the denuclearization of North Korea are still fuelling.
The media reported that after the Singapore summit, the United States had already sent a number of disarmament scenarios to the DPRK, but Pyongyang rejected them, calling them "gangster."

Nice called for "Moscow language to be replaced with a Ukrainian product"
Ukrainian children's writer and purity fighter Larisa Nice called for Ukraine to be replaced by "Russian-language Moscow product and Moscow language."
To do this, it offers a Ukrainian product - "cultural wave, cultural assault."
Nice shared his thoughts on the "feasibility of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine" with the Ukrainian publication "Observatory."
According to her, the relevant Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it even already exists and continues to develop further.
Over time, Ukrainians will "recover" from this "Moscow language," she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, according to her, earlier on television and radio the Russian speech was widely used, but in the public space it practically didn't remain.
Moreover, according to Nice, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: The actions of authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, are only "an extension of the limits for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level."
She shared her experience in maintaining the "Ukrainian-speaking regime" at a children's camp in Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the Watsons chain of bookstores by a court, a cashier of one of whom spoke to her in Russian.
Nice didn't get her own, and she twisted her hand into the girl.
It calls the consumption of Russian words by Ukrainians "linguistic schizophrenia," calling on Ukrainians to renounce Russian letters even in the writing of surnames.
Nice recently stated that the name "Rus" was stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moskovia.
The writer's Gnev could not escape even the Security Service of Ukraine: Having come there and heard conversations between employees on-Russian, she taught a scandal and left, knocking the door.

But once again, thanks to the physiotherapist and doctors that they put on their feet.

The appeal for the Dagestan deputy became news
The Soviet District Court of Makhachkala has detained Rajab Abdulatipov, a deputy of the People's Assembly of Dagestan, for two months, suspected of participating in a criminal association that formalized a disability for bribes.
Kommersant became aware of the details of the investigation materials, shedding light on how, according to the Investigative Committee of Russia, the younger brother of former head of the republic, Ramazan Abdulatipov Rajab Abdulatipov, facilitated criminal actions now the former head of the Main Bureau of Medico-Social Expertise, Magomed Makhachev, and his accomplices.
Among other things, during the prompt-searches conducted by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, it was established that Rajab Abdulatipov lobbied for the appointment of Magomed Makhachev as head of the office, allegedly receiving 70 million roubles for this.
Let us recall that earlier the investigation against Magomed Makhachev, other leaders and employees of the territorial bureau of medical services ,-social expertise, under his authority, initiated a criminal case under Article 210 (creation of a criminal association using a position of service and participation in it), Article 290 (receipt of bribes by an organized group), Article 292 (service forgery) and Article 159 (fraud in a particularly large amount) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
According to investigators, at the end of 2013, Rajab Abdulatipov, aware of the illegal actions of Magomed Makhachev and his accomplices involved in the theft of the Pension Fund, joined their activities by joining the criminal community.
Assuming the post of head of the Department of the Federal Migration Service of Russia for Dagestan and having links with state authorities and law enforcement agencies, and taking advantage of his relative relationship with the head of Dagestan, Rajab Abdulatipov, investigators believe, "ensured the activities of other participants in the criminal community, established contacts with officials of state bodies to support the illegal activities of Mahomed Makhachev and his position as head of the federal state institution," Main Bureau of Medico-social expertise in the Republic of Dagestan, "organized illegal identification of disabilities to citizens."
Following the announcement of these information at a meeting of the Soviet District Court on Friday, Rajab Abdulatipov rejected the charges against him.
"Of course, all that is being brought to me today as a charge, for me all this is new, absolutely I am not familiar with it," he said.
The Court arrested a deputy from "United Russia" not ten days before the indictment, as was the case with previous high-ranking Dagestani officials, but immediately for two months, as Article 210 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation appears in his case.
According to the Criminal Code-procedural code, investigators have much more time to charge - up to 45 days from the moment of detention.

The head of the Federation Council Committee for International Affairs, Konstantin Kosachev, considers the session of the UN General Assembly to be successful for Russia and does not rule out that it will be able to become a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in solving global problems.
"The understanding of the current 73-session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric we have almost become accustomed to in recent years against Russia has now been in order to be more stupid," the senator said in an interview published on Sunday by the "Russian newspaper."
He explained that, in previous years, the Russian Federation was sometimes "identified as one of the three main threats to humanity, then, along with the Ebola fever, then, along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this row, in any case, in the statement of a group of Western countries, which spoke on this matter quite unanimously."
At 73-of the session, Kosachev stressed, "Russia's topic in negative terms was virtually absent."
"If I carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the German Foreign Minister, I now don't take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, the choir wasn't entirely accurate," the politician drew attention, noting that Russia "was no longer a wall about which the blows train a tennis ball."
The head of the relevant committee of the Security Fed does not rule out that this indicates a trend that, in his opinion, "will allocate the current session of the [UN General Assembly], although this trend may be fully evident in a year, two to three."
"I don't rule out that the current session in what sense-could be turning," Kosachev admitted, explaining that "there are too many examples of how Russia's engagement can move forward in international affairs."
As an example, he cited situations in Syria, Iran and North Korea.
"Unfortunately, it is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time," added the parliamentarian.
This is due to the fact, he believes that there is "an adequate, common perception of Russia as not just a possible - an integral participant in solving the global problems of modern times."
"I don't want to make a mistake, but I have the feeling that we, where-is going through a point beyond which the movement will no longer be reversed, it will be moving forward," he added.
Another "interesting and important feeling" in this context, Kosachev called "a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop."
"I attended very many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I was very pleased to see that if a year ago ,-two or five years ago, the Russian view, the Russian vision of what is happening in the world, by and large, no one was interested, then the situation is different now," said the Chairman of the Committee of the Council.
In his opinion, this is due to the fact that "the so-called new liberal order, which embodies the West, has no answer to questions about how to solve world problems due to the obvious lack of ideas in the global space, a lack of ideas about how to solve problems in the Middle East, problems of terrorism, problems of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, problems of migration."
"And here, the request for a Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious," Kosachev expressed confidence, stressing that he believes in this sense "the current session is a good one for the Russian delegation, which is good for Russia."

State Duma deputy called to tell schoolchildren about the harmful masturbation
Onishchenko holds the post of First Deputy Chairman of the Committee for Education and Science.
Highlighting the experience of his work, he noted in an interview that teenagers to masturbation provoke harmful information they find on the Internet.
It is worth fighting this at the level of educational institutions and the family, the deputy added.
Gennady Onishchenko, deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with the radio station "Govorit Moscow":
As part of the general sex education of children, it is necessary to do this by explaining the puboo because there is a risk to the child's sexual health, both the boy and the girl.
The problem is objective, it is that the maturation of children is coming early enough, and then there are large scissors between their sexual maturation and the opportunity to officially enter into intersex contacts.
According to Onishchenko, the solution to the problem is hampered by "citizenship," the silence of "sexual age problems" and the lack of a culture of adequate upbringing of children.
The doctor is confident that many teenagers are facing onanism.
The deputy believes that the practice of lessons about the harmful nature of onanism is first and foremost worth practicing in schools of "hyper-roubanized" regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim republic, we will simply not understand with you, to put it mildly," the professor said.

AG became the second most popular in Germany
The Antiimmigrant Alternative for Germany scores another record of popularity, and Angela Merkel's ratings fall.
Soodya in all respects, German residents have started to seriously tired of Angela Merkel's immigration policy, which has made the country a cherished target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
The most recent social polls say this, according to which the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party is becoming increasingly popular, and the positions of the ruling bloc, Merkel and Zeehofer, are weakening.
This week, AG scored another record, climbing the second line in the popular sympathy rating.
The right-wing conservatives, with 17-percent of popularity, managed to bypass the Socialist-- Democrats, who have about 16 percent.
One percentage point could be written off for statistical error, but one should not forget the fact that the AG, created in 2013, from a small group of economists ,-euroskeptics, had managed to become a serious political force.
The leadership in the overall standpoint has so far continued to hold the ruling CSU / CDU bloc, which has around 30 percent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points here - back in April, Angela Merkel's support for the bloc was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German Chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also decreasing.
Today, 48 percent of Germans support Angela Merkel, which is 7 percent lower than last year.
It is a good idea that the democrats followed the Social-- by "green" (15%), left-wing (11%), and liberals (10%).
The "Alternative" Revolution
Alternative for Germany was founded in September 2012 on the basis of the group "Alternative Choice 2013," which included people from Christiansko-democratic union.
The Group initially entered the opposition in the government's course, but initially focused only on economic issues, including the euro and EU engagement.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany's "sponsorship" of weak EU economies, and did not rule out the possibility of a return to the German brand and a complete exit from the European Union.
Against the backdrop of the deepening immigration crisis, the AG political platform has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full-fledged party that took up the niche of euroskeptics and began to strongly criticize the government for the failure of immigration policy.
At the last parliamentary elections in 2017, AG managed to first break into the Bundestag, having received 94 deputy seats (from 709).
Two representatives of "Alternatives for Germany" get seats in the European Parliament.

Roshel Senator APC Apocalypse Bronevik
On the subject of apocalypse, money is not only done by producers of video games, film studios and book publishing houses.
Now, automotive companies are also developing a new niche for themselves.
So, Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions presented her Apocalypse apocalypse Senator APC.
In a fantastically free time, engineers of this company create armoured vehicles for the police.
Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers who are without special comfort but are safely placed in an all-welded armoured capsule.
This bunker, otherwise you won't call the design, as the level of its reservation corresponds to the B7 standard, is installed on the chassis of a powerful Ford Super Duty pickup.
His dome, also armored, can protect the capsule from grenades and antipersonnel mines.

In order to ensure that passengers do not even have an explosive wave from an unexploded shell near the car, the vehicle's cabin is equipped with special amortizing creams.
Moreover, the capsule has an autonomous system of ventilation and firefighting.

The term of death of the Universe is called
The universe exists for an additional 140 billion years, ten times the age of the observed world, equal to about 13.8 billion years.
The study of the international team of scientists has been published in the library of electronic preparers arXiv.org and has been published in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
To this conclusion, specialists came to watch the Subaru telescope over about a dozen million galaxies using the HSC camera (Hyper Suprime-Cam).
After monitoring the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which accounts for more than 95 percent of the energy at-mass of the observed world, scientists, working under the CDM standard cosmological model (Cold Dark Matter), estimated the rate of expansion of the universe, which turned out to be slightly slower than previously thought.
The press-release of the Subaru Observatory notes that the observations made it possible to obtain a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the Universe, and the recording of data from the European Planck space telescope clarified the restrictions imposed on the CDM parameters.
In July, scientists simulated the possible death of the Universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues presented new arguments in favour of the fact that the observed world will cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Great Gap.
So, even if I had convinced you to do-then, it's sometimes difficult to get as a result what kind of-that action.

Another attempt was made to unite the initiators of the pension referendum
Ability to get to know the opinion of the people about pension reform is postponed indefinitely
A meeting of the federal referendum initiative group against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups who registered different language of questions (the Central Election Commission registered five language formulations in total).
They decided to apply to the CEC for registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians: "Do you want the age set by the legislation on pension provision as of July 1, 2018, when citizens of Russia get the right to an old-age pension, not to raise?"
This wording was registered by a Vologda subgroup whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered to be the simplest and most legally binding language.
Most of the participants in the meeting were supporters of Ilya Sviridov, a member of Just Russia (six subgroups) and the CPRF (four subgroups).

Therefore, there was such a decision, "Bilyaletdinov quotes the press-club service.

Turbin's mistakes fell asleep in the "Loko" - "Ahmat" match as a horn of abundance
Former All-Union judge Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of arbitrator Yevgeny Turbin in match 9-of the round of the Russian championship "Lokomotiv" - "Ahmat" and dismantled the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you assess Yevgeny Turbin's referee in the Lokomotiv match - "Ahmat"?
- I believe that this arbitrator confirmed his unsuitability for judging the matches of the Russian premier ,-league.
I am surprised that at the fifth round of Spartak, Dynamo, neither Turbyn himself nor the leaders of the Department of Emergency Situations made serious conclusions about his low qualification.
The result didn't slow down to say in the ninth round: Mistakes in his actions, private passes of brutal receptions fell asleep as out of the horn of abundance.
For example, at 50-the tenth minute of Edera's train, Rodolfo, Advocate "Ahmata," takes his hands in his punitive area.
At the gate eight meters, but Turbin does not put a penalty.
- How do you estimate an episode involving Idov, which was at 82-minute when it seemed that the ball hit him in his hand?
- I consider that here was a deliberate game by the defender's hand in his punitive area.
Turbyn was close to the moment, sees this episode well and his first assistant to the right.
This moment was also to be seen by the reserve judge Sergei Karasev.
However, all three fell asleep and no penalty was assigned.
Therefore, the score in the match was distorted, and the sports justice was wrong.
This was the very case when judging by concepts pushed and buried the sports spirit of the game.
- At 52-the minute, Turbyn didn't decide to remove the guest defender, Oleg Ivanov, who violated the rules in the fight against Krykhovyak, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, demonstratively applauded him.
What do you think about this episode?
Was it necessary to show the second "mustard"?
- In this moment Turbyn and the first yellow card showed not quite in business.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about double standards of refereeing that which-the teams are penalized for such violations as in an episode with Idov, and which-is not.
What do you assess the words of the footballer?
- Considering what to mean by double standards.
There was a penalty.
They didn't give him.
In fact, the arbitrator does not give the second penalty to the opposite gate.
This is the principle that is used.
And the second point of double standards is that the judge looks at who plays.
Wot played on Saturday, Lokomotiv, and Ahmata has serious grievances for Turbin's work because the team was impaired.
- Men changed the floor, became a lesbian.
By his great joy, his team won the game.

Matt Damon played the raped Judge Kavano at the start of SNL
American actor Matt Damon played a U.S. Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kaavan, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first release of the new Saturday Night Live season on NBC TV.
During a small skater, the actor played Kavano at a Senate hearing on rape charges.
The Candidate to the Supreme Court of the United States had previously drawn attention to his emotion and detail of his stories during a conversation with Senator Amy Klobushar.
So, Kavanaugh repeatedly admitted his love for beer, but said he had never been drunk until his memories.
Furthermore, in an attempt to acquit himself on the charge of rape, Kavana stated that in those years he was a virgin.
These moments also beat Damon.
I just did that I was drinking a lot and didn't think about sex at all.
I was the most proud, the most drunk virgin who was either-or when-or saw.
Everyone is familiar with this, "said Matt Damon.
Rainer Kavana was elected as the supreme judge of the United States.
But pay attention to the face and the language of the body of anyone who is present in this vague picture, and you will feel that they all play.
But my advice to you is to tell them that you behaved badly and ran away, and apologize.

Barbra Strazand found strangers in her cloned dogs
American singer Barbra Strazand said the clones of her deceased dog behaved completely different from the original pet.
"They are not similar.
In fact, [clones] look like it, but it's impossible to clone the soul, "stressed 76-summer singer.
At the end of 2017, Strazand ordered two clones of her 14-summer cat dog ,-de-tulear, named Samantha, who had to be sucked from-for health problems.
In July 2018 ,-go, it was reported that a dog of chihuahua breed named by Chudo-Milli (Miracle Milly), who was called the smallest dog in the world, was cloned 49-the ninth time.
Specialists are engaged in cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand for what reason it is so miniature.
The United States has thought about the naval blockade of Russia from-for oil and gas supplies
In the United States, a naval blockade against Russia could be launched to gain an advantage in the global energy market.
American authorities are so zealous in the struggle for success in the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to the naval blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world's leading suppliers of energy.
U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke told about the possibility of a naval blockade the day before.
In reproach of world practice, the American Ministry of Internal Affairs does not perform police functions, but rather civil functions, including the implementation of a policy in the field of natural resources.
Therefore, Zinke's statement came entirely within the competence of the agency headed by him, even though it was not deprived of a political race.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that thanks to militarily-US naval forces control sea routes in the Middle East region and could block them if necessary.
From Zinke's words, it was clear that the need could be linked to Washington's desire to prevent Russian supplies to the global energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia still receives a lion's share of its revenues from supplies to the global oil and gas market at-.
The desire to distribute supplies of energy resources in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motivation for Moscow's revitalization in this region, Zinke is sure.
The minister made it clear that the U.S. at-still expects to provide leadership in the global energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do this, Washington will have to clarify Russia and Iran, and the naval blockade of trade routes - an acceptable measure on this path, Zinke believes.
"I've come to tell you that I'm going to Moscow tomorrow and will not return to this house anymore, and you will be informed of my decision through a lawyer to whom I will charge the divorce.

Top Sound Passenger Airplanes in the Russian Federation to be put to serial production
Serial production of supersound passenger planes in Russia will begin after 2030.

Expensive violin handed over to pawnbard for a priceless
When a man brought a violin in in the town of Somerville (Massachusetts), a LBC Boutique and Loan pawnaker, a pawnard worker offered only $50 for an old and unprofitable instrument.
But Dilan Mcdermitt, an experienced store manager, suspected it was an old and expensive tool, and asked an expert for advice.
Tutat-then it turned out that the violin was produced in 1759 by renowned Italian violin maker Ferdinando Gallano and is estimated at 250 thousand dollars.
Only the links to the violin are estimated at 16-18 thousand dollars.
The investigation found that the violin was not so long ago stolen from one of the residents of the city, and the tool was returned to the legal owner.
I don't know how the violin got to the person who gave it to the pawnard, but there are no previous clashes with the law.
The manager says now all those who bring the script into the pawn will be asked to play on it to make sure it really belongs to the customer.

In the ninth round of the RPL, we are waiting for an exciting confrontation: "Spartak" will take "Rostov" at its stadium in Tushin under the leadership of Valery Karpin - a person, as we know, absolutely not another "people's team."
One of the pickbacks of this meeting is that clubs now have an equal number of points - 15, and they share 3 and 4 places in the tournament table, lagging behind the far skipped "Zenit" and being in one point from "Krasnodar," which tomorrow plays with "Dynamo."
Red-whites now have a difficult band: The club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the League of Europe, the team of Massimo Carrera unexpectedly pulled "Rapido," and recently lost home to "Ahmatu."
After the derby with CSKA, which ended with a fair draw, Spartak, with a minimal score and not without difficulty, beat in the Cup "Chernomorets," and it is too early to talk about whether the most popular club in Russia has come to an exit from the crisis.
Rostov could not win three matches in a row, but also didn't know defeats here already five matches.

The observer groups record in detail what is happening and communicate with members of the electoral commissions, so that they can then be presented in the final report. "

The Translator compared the mentality of Russians and Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but few differences between them do not play a big role for mutual understanding.
This was announced on International Translator Day, September 30, by a professional translator ,-, synchronist, Bairbel Sakse.
She has been engaged in translations from Russian and English for more than 30 years.
"The Germans love calmly planning events, and the Russians, as the proverb says," hide for a long time, let them go quickly. "
But it seems to me, for mutual understanding between peoples and for the work of an interpreter, it does not play a significant role, "the expert said in the comment" RIA Novosti. "
According to the translator, to understand that the two countries don't care about each other, "it's enough to know history."
And in the future, Sakse noted, Germany makes no sense to ignore Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, and it makes no sense to try to ignore it.

The comedy "Vechernaya School" led the American boxing-office
The comedy "Vechernaya School," which debuted in American cinemas last Friday, earned $28 million in hire for its first weekend.
This result allowed an uncomplicated picture with Kevin Hart and Tiffanie Haddish to head the boxing-US office for 28-September 30 in the main roles.
On the international market, the film, which has so far been released in only 20 countries, has collected $5.5 million, including 2 million from British viewers.
In the struggle for the first line, Malcolm Lee's creation, which is noteworthy, has been quite noticeably ahead of another newcomer of the Western leprosy - the multik "Smolfoot," the curious story of acquainting a charming yeti with a representative of the human family, in whose existence the main character has never believed.
The director's project, Carey Kirkpatrick and Jason Reisiga, collected $23 million over the weekend, generally meeting the expectations of experts who predicted the tape 20-25 million for the weekend.
As for the total charges of Smolfoot, at the moment, they amount to $38.6 million (he debuted already in 50 countries): Mexico was the most active here, adding 3.6 million to the film's treasury.
Troika the strongest this time closed the children's fairy tale "The Mystery of the House with Hours" from the horror master Elay Rot, who finally proved that the director is able to make quality films and for the audience 12 +.
For his second week in rolling, the shielding of John Bellers's book with charming Jack Blak and Keith Blancett earned $12.5 million, bringing the total world fee to 53.8 million.
Despite departing from the top of-3, continues to amaze with the sign "+" triller with Blake Layewli and Anna Kendrick "Easy request": In 17 days in American rental, Paul Figa's picture, from which-the unreal financial achievements were originally not expected from the word "at all," collected $43 million (including 6.6 million for 28 -30 October)) and right now has a total revenue of 62.9 million.
The last representative of the first five this week was the horror "Nuns Curse," which collected $5.4 million during the reporting period.
Spin-of "Zaklyatiya" after 24 days in American (and, of course, not only) cinemas has $330 million of total earnings on his account, and has recently been proud to be the most successful franchise film, which also includes two parts of "Zaklyatiya" itself and two tapes about Annabel's bare doll.
Following the horror of Corina Hardy, another genre spokesman, Hallfest debut, one of the major youth choirs of the year, was put in line with the results of the past weekend.
In his first weekend, Gregory Plottkin, a well-known montage (and a recent director), who had previously worked in a number of large-projects, including Hellfest's Happy Day of Death, for which Hallfest is very similar, earned $5.1 million in the United States.
Given the modest budget of the film, the result is extremely positive.
Seventh became the "Without wealthy Asians" ($4.15 million), which seem to not think to fall out of the top of-10 American boxing-office: A romantic comedy that has been on screens for the seventh week, following the results of September is the sixth in the ranking of the genre's most cash tapes in history, with a figure of 165.7 million.
In fact, the picture has already earned such amount on the domestic market - the total revenue of the tape is 218.8 million.
As for the last three lucky people who hit the top 10 in the U.S. for 28-September 30, they were Hizhnik, White Hot Rick, and... The Ball Mate, who earned $3.7 million, 2.38 million and 1.1 million respectively during the weekend.
It is a good idea that, as early as next weekend, the United States will gather the long-awaited "Vienna" with Tom Hardy, who - there can be no doubt about this - will have leadership in the American boxing-office on the first weekend of October.

Valery Belov: The Lord helped Siberia today
Valery Belov, head coach of Vityaz, is about the defeat from Siberia (3: 4) in the regular KHL championship match.
"The College spoke about" Siberia "fans, and I want to note our fans," Belov quotes the official website "Vityazia."
"I hope they will support the same way, because now almost every game is full stadium, an excellent atmosphere.
In the game, probably, the Lord helped Siberia today because they were very badly wrong, especially our leaders.
In general, we lost a micro - match 0: 3 our leading leaders, so it was difficult for us to pull out this match, though there were moments.
But, nevertheless, all-will take over the blame.

"This is an unimaginable kumovaniya"
Zriters are outraged by the choice of Agutina at the show "Voice"
The slogans of the show "Volos 60 +" accuse the mentor Leonid Agoutina of "an unimaginable mouthpiece and a naked sketch."
When he heard the voice of his father, Nikolai Agoutina, from the very beginning in the blind wiretaps, many hoped that he would remain neutral and would not turn to the performer.
But the sons of the senses took the top, and he chose a relative to his team.
Then many considered this a joke, but forgave the mentor bias at the first stage.
But the "joke" was delayed, and the star's father absolutely unjustifiably took the place of more dignified performers.
And now viewers are not ready to forgive Agutina such injustice.
In the evening, we, the viewers of the show, were outraged by the kumovanie of the unimaginable and frank dragging of our close relatives onto the final staircase.
I even doubted that Agutina would have enough strength and conscience not to drag his father to the first place before the end, "Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina reasoned in the program" Man of TVs. "
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father, Leonid Agoutin, "merged" fine performers who really sang while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining that viewers still want to see his father in the show.
But, as it turned out, this is not the case at all, viewers want an objective assessment and see truly talented performers in the final, and now Agoutin has discredited the show.
"I sympathize with the participants of the Voice from the team of Augustin - they were doomed."
"Last time, Augustin showed how he loves his father, and today he had to show himself as a professional."
"The competition has lost its meaning."
"Remove from the project two talented people and leave in the project his father who doesn't sing but whisper, how can you call the mentor after that?,"
"Wake up as a dad sings, organise a concert in the Kremlin for your money and watch how many people will come to this concert."
This is the show "Voice," not the show "Circle Relatives."
"From Agutina's side it was unprofessional."
"Then it's necessary to offer a dad on his own show, not on the show, which is made for the money of Chana 1."
"It was a real chance for whom-that was, and he took whose place ,-.
And I don't understand why a neat dad should call me more understanding than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why did a working man from Surgut, with a splendid voice and a timbre, merge and Dad Agoutina get to the final?
And then we all complain that on stage and from screens the same faces for decades!
Yes, because don't break through the kumovanie! "
"What did you expect?

Moreover, he said: "Come here, go here, everything is clear."
Agoutin could not act as a professional.

The scientist told about the possible scientific program of the Russian Federation's expedition to the Moon
The head of the Institute for Space Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences, member of-correspondent of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Anatoly Petrukovich, told RIA Novosti about a possible program of scientific research for Russian cosmonauts on the Moon.
According to him, now the scientific community is developing directions for such works.
"There is no consolidated opinion yet," the scientist stressed.
He noted that one option was to place a low-frequency radio telescope on the reverse side of the Moon, which would avoid the interference caused by the Earth.
"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to investigate space radiation sources," Petrukovich added.
He also believes that the Moon could be used to test robotics and use local resources for construction.
Moreover, astronauts should be involved in searching for a primitive organism on Earth's satellite, the scientist believes.
This could help determine how life appears on the planets.

Sirius riots discussed similar technologies with environmental scientists
Residents of the Sirius Educational Center in Sochi, participants of the School of Agribiology and Plant Genetics, visited a lecture by scientists from the national research center "Kurchatov Institute."
The statement of researchers took place within the framework of the Global International Forum for Convergent and Natural Technologies program, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, is reported on the website of the educational center on September 29.

The scholar's Lecture was published on the Sirius website.
Shkolniki learned that modern technologies need a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet able to develop such volumes.
Environmental technologies, which young scientists are currently working on, will help solve this problem, according to the organizers of the forum.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of environmental technologies, and also spoke about the risks that inevitably arise from the creation of such technologies.
"The advent of such technologies is a unique thing, it is a colossal benefit.
It is an explosive growth in medical technologies, it is an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there is also a second side.
The development of environmental technologies is actually a technological reproduction of living nature systems.
There is a reverse side - a purposeful interference in the life of a person.

Macedonia: The referendum did not take place from-for a low turnout
The Referendum was called upon to approve the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country as "Northern Macedonia."
Greece objected to the use by Macedonians of the name of their historic province.
The renaming vanished the former Yugoslav Republic with the opening of the way to NATO and later to the EU.
But, according to the EFE agency, only 34% of the appearance on the Sunday plebiscite "did not reach" the constitutional threshold of 50%.
However, since the referendum was only consultative, the authorities in Skopje may decide not to rename them.
Coming out shortly after the closure of polling stations, Prime Minister-Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, a proponent of a change in the name of the republic, said that if there is more "yes" among the votes cast, Macedonia will change the name, regardless of the unreached quorum.

Let and get - how is it right?
The Word to give does not exist.
The right thing is to catch up.
The word "give" in the meaning "pull, influence, impact" exists only phonetically because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "catch."
We use this word, believing it comes from the word "pressure."
But "pressure" and "catch" ethymologically are not only not close, but even in what sense ,-, are the opposite.
Try it yourself.
Dovlet (book church, outdated) means "enough, complete enough, to be sufficient for someone to-or what to-or to satisfy."
To keep up, pleasure is kindred words.
Ranche still had a meaning "not to depend on anything, to have a self-fulfilling meaning" - "to catch himself."
Staroslavyansky "dovlelets" are related to the words "lead" and "will."
Give, suppress - absolutely different.
These words, by-, are really terrifying "relatives": Daos - "wolf" (giving sheep), deyja - "die" and dvaidα - "oppress."
The resulting phonetic appearance of the words "pressure" and "catch up," as well as the imminent obsolescence of the latter, forced them to embark on the continuum.
So we've got this very "d [a] to drive," which is also used through a letter, which, according to-good, is wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of the emergence and development of these words.
So, the right thing is to catch up.
But this word is outdated, in its proper meaning no longer used.
If you want to note which-or circumstances / people have a negative impact on you from above, use the word "press."
You can also use the "pressure" design, but remember it's the office.

With the help of an operation in Syria, Russia has shielded itself from terrorists
Over the course of three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, about 100 thousand terrorists have been killed, 85 thousand of them have been killed by the Russian space forces.
This was reported in connection with the third anniversary of the start of the Russian military operation in Syria by Viktor Bondaryev, former head of the Committee of the Federation Council for Defence and Security.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of air lethal means: Aerospace forces carried out and continue to carry out all attacks precisely on terrorist targets.
According to Bondaryev, tens of thousands of terrorist objects have been destroyed in Syria in three years, such as ammunition storage, reinforcements and headquarters.
With the help of Russian air strikes, jihadists' defence was hacked - it became a decisive contribution to the promotion of Syrian government troops, Interfax reports.
At the same time, according to Bondaryev, the operation of our military in Syria allowed to protect Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including Islamic State (IG, banned in Russia) and Jabhat  -Nusra (banned in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, about four thousand militants from among Russian citizens and about five thousand citizens from post-Soviet countries fought on the side of IS, TASS reports.
And this is only about registered individuals, not including those who have not been identified, Bondaryev emphasized.
Most of them were trained and ready at any time to take weapons into their hands, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter the territory of our country.
Thus, Bondaryev noted, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism on distant frontiers - otherwise this evil "would have poured on us."

Syria accused the US of supporting terrorism
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem accused the US and its partners of war crimes in Syria and supporting terrorism.
[The Western] coalition completely destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqa, destroyed infrastructure and public services in areas targeted, and carried out mass killings of civilians, including children and women.
These killings are war crimes under international law, "he said.
According to Muallem, the United States and its partners provided "direct support to the terrorists," as the objectives of militants and the Western coalition in Syria coincided and implied "the sowing of chaos, death and destruction on their way."
The Foreign Minister also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria is almost complete, and in the country has become more secure and stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intends to clear Syria from an illegal foreign presence, and priority in the reconstruction of the country will be given to Syrian partners.

President of Ukraine Piotr Poroshenko believes that while respecting the sovereignty of other states, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
The head of state said this during a trip to Kharkiv region commenting on Hungary's issuance of its passports to Zakarpatye.
By protecting Ukrainian citizens, I defend the sovereignty of our state.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other states, we demand the same respect for Ukraine, "stressed Poroshenko.
According to Poroshenko, he, as the president, will protect Ukrainian citizens wherever they are - in the east or in the west of the country.
At the same time, the head of state supported the position of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the passport scandal with Hungary, which consists in the intention to expel the consul of this country from Beregovo.
"I fully share every letter that has been said by the MFA," the President noted.
As reported by FACT, on September 19, a video appeared on the network, which recorded the moment of issuing Ukrainian citizens at the Hungarian consulate in Beregovo Hungarian passports.
In doing so, they took an oath of allegiance to Hungary.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Pavel Klimkin, noted that the consul of Hungary, which appears on video with the distribution of Hungarian passports to Ukrainians, should leave the territory of Ukraine either by the decision of Budapest itself, or be expelled by Kiev.
It also became known that the prosecutor's office of the Zakarpatsky region initiated a criminal case in relation to the issuance of Hungarian passports.

Putin secretly flew to Siberia
It is known that Vladimir Putin spent the last two days in Dushanbe, where he took part in the work of the CIS Council of States, and also held a number of bilateral meetings with the presidents of neighbouring countries.
Data on Russian flight No. 1 on the Flightradar website indicate that approximately 6 p.m. on Tajik time on September 28, Il-96-300 flew from Dushanbe airport and took a course north of-east.
In the area of Lake Balkhash, the transponder of the plane was turned off.
The direction of his flight indicates that the airliner could fly to Khakassia.
According to the agency "Baikal24," the president in Abakan met personally Governor of the region Victor Zimin on the night of September 29.
According to unofficial information, Putin arrived in the republic to spend a weekend, but the sources of the site believe that the true reason is "the problem of the second round."
Next Sunday, a second round of regional head election is to be held in Khakassia.
Valentin Konovalov (CPRF) and the current head of the republic, Victor Zimin (United Russia), took part in it.
However, on September 21, Zimin withdrew his candidature.
Andrei Filyagin ("Just Russia") should take part in the upcoming tour together with Konovalov.
The Khakassi media suggest that Putin can accept the resignation of the head of Khakassia and appoint a new head of the republic, as well as make a decision on the fate of Zimin.
Putin has already visited Khakassia in January of this year.
Along with Tuva, this republic is one of the favourite places of the president for rest.

Metropolitan Hilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename the UPC with the actions of the fascists
Metropolitan Hilarion, Head of the Synodal Department of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the fascists against Jews.
"It's all the same that in fascist Germany, to target a yellow sharp star for a Jew, it means marking the Church as an enemy organisation, and it is for this purpose that this bill was created," said the Metropolitan on the air of Russia-24 (Interfax quote).
In his opinion, this step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian conflict is in an acute stage ,-Ukrainian.
Kiev thus hopes to get full control of the UPC and "put it out of the law," the minister believes.
"This is a Ukrainian church, and the faithful of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country," he added.
It became known that the Verkhovna Rada deputies are working on the implementation of bills No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The Last One assumes the renaming of the UPC of the Moscow Patriarchate.

Chief of the Pochaev Lavra called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian holy sites
Metropolitan Volodymyr Sviatoto-Uspenskaya Pochaev's Lavra called for the protection of the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian holy sites.
The text of his appeal to the faithful of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UPC) was published on Saturday on the website of the monastery.
In different times of history, our predecessors and Christians, born in faith and spirit, have had to confess their faith and defend their holy sites.
Given the situation that has developed, and according to the information we have, and the death threats that are spreading, it is clear that we will also have to live through-, "the Metropolitan said.
He asked for support - prayer, moral.
In the same vein, the laureate stressed that it is likely "that your physical presence will be needed."
The clergyman added: "Lenin's grandchildren are spiritually at risk of slaughter, and therefore we will defend our holy place."
To whom is not indifferent to the fate of the Pochaev Lavra - the Orthodox Ukrainian and the world holy place, it is necessary to be ready to protect it, the appeal says.
The Metropolitan urged that those who mislead the believers not be taken into account.
The UPC has a canonical status determined by Tomos on October 29, 1990 from the Mother of the Church.
And now who ,-, wants to make it dependent on the new patriarch and friend of the Roman Catholic Pope Bartholomew.
The new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us by the Orthodox.
And we are pleased with the status our church has, "noted the deputy of the Lavra.
He recalled that since October 1990, the UPC has been canonically independent and fully independent in its management.
There is no financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate at any-or administratively-.
Actico Tomos already has our church.
What else do we need Tomos? "Metropolitan Vladimir of Pochaev noted, calling on believers and all citizens to ask if other confessions of Tomos have, are they independent of the Vatican?
The believers in what-the extent to which they were able to understand and determine which temple they should walk.
However, whom-would like to sow hatred and discord again.
Some are eaten by envy that they shine the domes on the temples they want to destroy, "the priest stressed.
Pochaev Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.

Macedonian chief oppositionist refused to vote in referendum
In Macedonia, on Sunday, September 30, a referendum is being held on the issue of an intergovernmental treaty with Greece on the renaming of the Republic of Macedonia.

The agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic - the Republic of Northern Macedonia - was signed by the heads of the MFA of Macedonia and Greece on 17 June of this year during a solemn ceremony on the shores of Lake Prespa, which marks the border between the two countries.
This treaty should resolve a multi-year dispute over the name of the country, as well as Skopje's path to NATO and the EU, reminds TASS.

The United States is pleased to see an increase in opiate production in Afghanistan
On September 26, a lot was said in Tehran about the sharp worsening of the situation in Afghanistan.
There were multilateral consultations with the participation of Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, which was represented by Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, on Afghan territory, militants unleashed a real terrorist war against state authorities and the civilian population of the country.
This year has become a record year in terms of the number of bloody attacks that have killed thousands of ordinary Afghans, "Patrushev noted.
Afghanistan's ills started far from yesterday.
Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the main enemy of the United States was declared the terrorist group, Al -Qaida (banned in the Russian Federation), which settled in Afghanistan.
It has not been a month since America and NATO allies launched a military operation there, "Enduring Freedom."
It was 17 years old.
The multi-thousand American contingent is still on Afghan soil.
But peaceful life is even more ghost than at that time.
American troops are caught behind the fences of dozens of their bases.
As may be, they are buying off militants for money - they wouldn't be touched.
The Government of Afghanistan controls a smaller part of the country - 40%, according to Patrushev.
50% - the Taliban movement (banned in the Russian Federation).
Another 10% is for ISIS terrorists (banned in the Russian Federation).
But they are growing there quickly.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia - exactly what they did not have in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be happy with this.
It is also gratifying that, over the 17 years of the American presence, the production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times.
There is a colossal growth in areas sown with opium poppy and multibillion-dollar profits.

The Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on accession to the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the name of the country.
The Agreement on the renaming of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia into the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on June 17 as a result of long negotiations with neighbouring Greece, which refused to recognize the right of its northern neighbour to be called Macedonia, looking at such a name as an attempt on the Greek province of the same name and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovsky, political scientist: "Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or Northern Macedonia gets the right to a better future, hope for social change.
And Greece will consolidate the right to its past.
There are no Ideal agreements.
They arise as a result of difficult compromises can not please absolutely everyone. "
The country's renaming is supported by the ruling Socialists ,-Democrats, headed by Prime Minister ,-, Minister Zoran Zaev.
The opposition is conservative opposition and the president of the country, Georges Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetina Chilimanov, Macedonia does not make sense to join the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with him: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government, headed by Zaev, is imposed outside in order to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, I will lose sovereignty.
It is obvious that there are countries that wouldn't want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans. "
