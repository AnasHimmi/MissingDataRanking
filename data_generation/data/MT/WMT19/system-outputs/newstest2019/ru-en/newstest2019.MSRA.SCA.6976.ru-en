The number of new recruits from Ukraine preparing to send to Donbass is named
The official representative of the People's militia of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) Andriy Marochko said that in the winter of 2018-2019 Ukraine will send at least 3,000 new recruits to Donbass.
According to him, thus Kiev plans to "at least somehow complete the units".
"Unwillingness of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, mass layoffs have led to low staffing", - said Marochko, quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that the real numbers of Ukrainians called up for the army can be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched the so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by the operation of the Joint Forces (JF).
This measure was supposed to strengthen the role of Ukrainian security forces in resolving the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbas deteriorated due to the murder of the head of the DPR Alexander Zakharchenko.
The DPR authorities qualified the incident as a terrorist act.
During the investigation of the criminal case were detained several people involved in the explosion.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the sabotage was organized by the Ukrainian secret services.

British Foreign Minister compared the EU with the Soviet Union and prison
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of capturing the member states of the community.
This statement was made by the diplomat at the Congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, September 30.
According to the Daily Mail, thus Hunt commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to faith in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave.
The lesson of history is obvious: If you turn the EU from a community into a prison, the desire to leave it will not decrease, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to escape from captivity",the Minister said.
He also added that attempts to punish the UK for the decision to leave the European Union will only exacerbate the crisis, said "Gazeta.ru".
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Theresa May announced that the Brexit negotiations had reached an impasse.
She commented on the results of the informal EU summit in Salzburg.
The decision on Brexit was taken in 2016 following a referendum.
The United Kingdom's withdrawal is expected to take place before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by many factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
In addition, the issue of the Irish border remains open.
Further information on the European Water Policy as well as the full text of legislation and other documents are available on the website of the Commission.

Ilon Musk is forced to resign as head of the board of directors of Tesla
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla founder Ilon Musk settled their dispute over fraud.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the TV channel, as part of the agreements reached Musk will have to leave the post of head of the board of directors Tesla.
Thus the commission allowed Musk to keep a post of the head of Tesla.
As noted, the founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million
The same amount will be charged to Tesla.
The money will be distributed among the affected investors.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Ilon Musk is an American entrepreneur, included in the list of 50 richest people in the world according to Forbes magazine.
He is the head of the space corporation SpaceX, neurotechnology company Neuralink and the developer of electric cars Tesla, as well as co-founder of Paypal.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission previously sued Tesla CEO Ilon Musk because of his message, posted on Twitter, about a possible buyout of the company.
Last month Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy back all shares on the stock exchange at a fixed price of $420.
The share price of $420 was set allegedly "because of the importance of this number in marijuana culture", Bloomberg reported earlier, citing co-director of the commission's security Stephen Peykin.
At the same time, Ilon Musk subsequently abandoned his plans to buy back the shares.
Commenting on the lawsuit filed against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman said that he considers the accusations of fraud unfounded, and added that he is very disappointed and saddened by these claims.
"Honesty is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I did not violate it in any way", - said the businessman in an interview with CNBC.
In August, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a class action lawsuit against Musk, complaining of financial losses.
The plaintiffs claimed that the posts of businessman brought them losses.
In particular, one of the shareholders said that tweets businessman misled, because of which the sellers of Tesla shares were forced to buy paper at artificially high prices to cover their positions.
Other plaintiffs also noted that the careless statements of Ilon Musk led to sharp fluctuations in the rate.
In September, Ilona Musk was also accused of stock market fraud by the head of research company Citron Research.
Meanwhile, if Musk could not resolve his dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, he would face removal from the company's management and even jail.
This, in particular, said CNBC former chairman of the commission Harvey Pitt.
Musk is "not a bad guy who can't run a car company".
I thought",Oh you, how dark the world is!"
"Yes, yes, how was it?" He thought, recalling the dream".Yes, how was it?

This is an information echo after the European Congress of Cardiology, - said Nikita Lomakin, Chief Cardiologist of the Central Design Bureau of the Presidential Administration.
There have been reports that aspirin does not protect in primary prevention in people at low risk of heart and vascular disease.

Trump spoke about "falling in love" with Kim Jong-un
From mutual cruelty, US and North Korean leaders almost fell in love with each other, Donald Trump joked.
Us President Donald Trump made a good joke about his successes on the front of resolving the North Korean crisis.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, now the leaders of the two countries have so corrected relations that they are almost in love with each other, said the American president.
The owner of the White House recalled that he accepted from the previous administration the North Korean problem as the main difficulty in foreign policy.
Trump noted that Barack Obama's team so launched relations with the DPRK that it could not even call the country's leadership - there simply did not remove the phone.
Then the US and North Korea were on the verge of war, and today the North Korean leader is writing "fine letters" to the White House, Trump said.
Trump admitted that he, too, was "cruel" to Kim Jong-un at the start of his presidency, which was mutual.
But now their relationship has improved so much that the leaders "fell in love with each other".
At the same time, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the American media would interpret them as incompetence.
Trump noted that Pyongyang has recently stopped nuclear and missile tests, as well as closing military firing ranges.
All these are merits of work of his administration, the American president is sure.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump spoke flattering of Kim Jong-un from the rostrum of the UN General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for his courage and steps to de-escalate tensions.
At the same time, Trump noted that sanctions against the DPRK will remain until the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
Singapore talks
On June 12, Singapore hosted the first-ever talks between US and North Korean leaders.
After a serious deterioration of relations and mutual threats of use of nuclear weapons, the summit looked like a turning point in the protracted US-Korean crisis.
Following the talks, the parties expressed their intention to move towards a peaceful resolution of the contradictions, although they did not undertake any legal obligations.
The positive results of the meeting were the cessation of North Korea's nuclear and missile tests, as well as the return to the United States of the remains of American soldiers who were in the country.
At the same time, other practical steps toward denuclearization of North Korea are stalled.
The media reported that after the Singapore summit, the United States sent several disarmament scenarios to the DPRK, but Pyongyang rejected them, calling them "gangster".

Nitsoy urged to replace the "Moscow language Ukrainian product"
Ukrainian children's writer and fighter for the purity of her native language Larisa Nitsoy called for ousting from Ukraine "the Russian-language Moscow product and the Moscow language".
She proposes to do it with Ukrainian product - "cultural wave, cultural pressure".
Nitsoy shared her thoughts on the "advisability of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine" with the Ukrainian edition of "Observer".
According to her, the corresponding Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it even exists and continues to develop further.
Over time, Ukrainians will "recover" from this "Moscow language", she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, she said, earlier on television and radio the Russian speech was widely used, but in the public space it practically didn't remain.
At the same time, according to Nitsoy, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: The actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, are only "the expansion of borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level".
Previously, Nitsoy shared her experience of maintaining the "Ukrainian-speaking regime" in a children's camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the court network of bookstores Watsons, the cashier of one of which communicated with her in Russian.
Not having achieved the, Nitsoy threw in the girl delivery.
She calls the use of Russian words by Ukrainians "linguistic schizophrenia", urging Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in the writing of surnames.
Recently Nitsoy declared that the name "Russia" was stolen from Ukrainians so Russia should be called Moscow.
The anger of the writer could not avoid even the Security Service of Ukraine: Coming there and hearing conversations with each other in Russian, she caused a scandal and left, slamming the door.

At the referendum in Macedonia recorded violations
Four incidents involving violations of electoral law were registered in the Republic of Macedonia at the referendum on the intergovernmental treaty with Greece on renaming.
This was announced on Sunday by the press secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Tony Angelovsky.
Since the opening of polling stations, 4 incidents have been recorded and eliminated",he said.
At the polling station at the Lazo Angelovski primary school in Skopje, 22-year-old K.J. violated public order and peace, insulted citizens and attacked police officers.
He was detained and taken to the police station.
According to the representative of the Foreign Ministry, all the offenders were immediately taken to the police stations.
The Ministry noted that all violations are checked.
"The Ministry will act in accordance with the law, so that citizens can safely use the constitutional right to freely express their will.
We urge citizens to observe the laws and refrain from any violation of public order and peace and any violation of the secrecy of voting",the representative of the Interior Ministry said.
Citizens in Sunday's referendum are asked to answer one question: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?"
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year-old dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav Republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek region.
On June 17, the Foreign Ministers of Macedonia and Greece signed an agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia during a ceremony on the shore of Lake Prespa, where the border between the two countries runs.
It provides for the use of the name "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
This treaty should resolve not only the long-standing dispute over the country's name, but also open Skopje's way to NATO and the EU.

This opinion was expressed by Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem in an interview with RT, aired on Sunday.

I want to say that this is a very timely step, and we are very grateful to Russia for its efforts in this regard",the Minister said.

Pashinyan hopes to hold early parliamentary elections in 2018
Parliamentary elections may be held in 2018, Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said.
"It is possible before the end of the year", - the head of government answered the question of journalists about the timing of their holding (quote from Interfax).
Mr. Pashinyan also did not rule out that he will "take people back to the streets" to hold early elections if the discussion of this issue with the parliamentary forces is not successful.
But I am committed to holding talks with the parliamentary forces.
I hope that they are also committed to a constructive dialogue",Novosti-Armenia quoted the Prime Minister as saying.
Nikol Pashinyan added that early elections are a "demand of the people" as well as a part of the government's program, which the parliament voted for.
A "long-term vision of the government", he said, is also necessary to attract investment and develop the economy.
At the UN General Assembly in New York, Mr. Pashinyan promised after returning to Yerevan to start "negotiations with representatives of all parliamentary and extra-parliamentary forces to discuss the time and conditions of early elections".
In the current parliament, about half of the deputies represent the Republican Party of Armenia (RPA) opposed to Mr. Pashinyan.
Early voting is impossible without the dissolution of Parliament, and there are no legal grounds for this.

The accusation for the Dagestan deputy became news
Soviet District Court of Makhachkala detained for two months deputy of the People's Assembly of Dagestan Rajab Abdulatipov, suspected of participation in a criminal association that issued a disability for bribery.
"Kommersant" became aware of the details of the investigation, shedding light on exactly how, according to the Investigative Committee of Russia, the younger brother of the former head of the republic Ramazan Abdulatipov Rajab Abdulatipov contributed to the criminal actions of the former head of the Main Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise Magomed Makhachev and his accomplices.
Among other things, in the course of search operations conducted by employees of the Interior Ministry, it was found that Rajab Abdulatipov lobbied for the appointment of Magomed Makhachev to the post of head of the bureau, allegedly receiving for it 70 million rubles.
Earlier, the investigation against Magomed Makhachev, other leaders and employees of the territorial bureau of medical and social expertise, which are under his authority, was prosecuted under Art. 210 (creation of a criminal association using official position and participation in it), Art. 290 (bribery by an organized group), Art. 292 (forgery) and Art. 159 (fraud on a large scale) of the Criminal Code.
As follows from the materials of the investigation, at the end of 2013 Rajab Abdulatipov, aware of the illegal actions of Magomed Makhachev and his accomplices engaged in embezzlement of the Pension Fund, joined their activities, joining a criminal association.
While serving as head of the Federal Migration Service of Russia in Dagestan and having connections in government and law enforcement agencies, as well as taking advantage of his relationship with the head of Dagestan, Rajab Abdulatipov, investigators believe",ensured the activities of other members of the criminal association, established contacts with government officials to support the illegal activities of Magomed Makhachev and his tenure as head of the federal state institution" Main Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise in the Republic of Dagestan",organized the illegal establishment of disability for citizens".
After the disclosure of this information at a meeting of the Soviet District Court on Friday Rajab Abdulatipov denied the charges against him.
"Of course, everything that is presented to me today as a charge, for me all this is new, absolutely I am not familiar with it", - he said.
The court arrested the deputy from the "United Russia" not for ten days before the indictment, as was the case with previous high-ranking officials of Dagestan, and immediately for two months, because his case appears under Article 210 of the Criminal Code.
According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, the investigation has much more time to bring charges - up to 45 days from the moment of detention.

Serbian President wants to ask Putin for support
Serbian President Alexander Vucic will discuss the situation in Kosovo with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and ask for his support during a meeting in Moscow.
Serbian President Alexander Vucic will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.
During the meeting, he plans to discuss the current situation with his Russian counterpart in Kosovo.
In addition, Vucic intends to ask Putin for support.
The Serbian leader made the relevant statement during a press conference, the local newspaper "Evening News".
According to the source, the head of Serbia said that, speaking about the need for support from the Russian side, he does not mean military support following the example of Syria.
Alexander Vucic said that he does not want to allow a scenario in which any major military clashes could occur on the territory of the state.
The President promised to make every effort to preserve peace, the newspaper reports.
We add that according to the Serbian media, the meeting of the heads of Russia and Serbia is scheduled for Tuesday, October 2, writes "Lenta.ru".
A day earlier, it was reported that the Serbian President had put the state army on full alert because of the situation in Kosovo.
This refers to the events of last Friday, when several dozen Kosovo special forces entered the territory adjacent to the lake that supplies water to the hydroelectric power plant "Gazivoda".
It is specified that this hydroelectric power plant is located on the territory of Kosovo, but at the same time refers to the Serbian power system.
Recall that Kosovo declared independence from Serbia ten years ago, but Belgrade refused to recognize this fact.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly the topic of Russia in a negative way was almost absent
Head of the Federation Council Committee on Foreign Affairs Konstantin Kosachev considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly successful for Russia and does not exclude that it can become a turning point in the perception of Russia as an integral participant in solving global problems.
"The uniqueness of this 73rd session, in my opinion, lies in the fact that the rhetoric to which we are almost accustomed in recent years against Russia, was now much more muted", - said the senator in an interview published on Sunday",Rossiyskaya Gazeta".
He explained that in previous years, the Russian Federation was sometimes "identified as one of the three main threats to humanity, now along with Ebola, now along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this row, at least in the statement of a group of Western countries, which spoke quite unanimously on this subject".
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed",the topic of Russia in a negative way was virtually absent".
"If we carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Germany, I do not take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, at least, the choir was not quite accurate", - said the politician, noting that Russia "was no longer a wall, which trains blows with a tennis ball".
The head of the relevant committee of the Security Council does not rule out that this indicates a certain trend, which, in his opinion",will allocate the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although this trend may be fully manifested in a year, two, three".
"I do not rule out that the current session in some sense may be a turning point", - admitted Kosachev, explaining that "too many examples of how with the involvement of Russia managed to move forward in international affairs".
He cited the situation in Syria, Iran and North Korea as examples.
"So far, unfortunately, it is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time", - added the parliamentarian.
This is due to the fact, he believes, that there is "an adequate, sound perception of Russia as not just a possible - an integral participant in solving the global problems of our time".
"I would not like to make a mistake, but I have a feeling that somewhere we pass a point beyond which the movement will no longer be a reverse, it will be a movement forward", - he added.
Kosachev called another "interesting and important feeling" in this context "the request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop".
"I attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly], Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I saw with great pleasure that if a year or two or five years ago the Russian opinion, the Russian vision of what is happening in the world, in general, no one was interested, but now the situation is different", - said the chairman of the Security Council Committee.
According to him, this is due to the fact that "the so-called new liberal order, which is represented by the West, has no answers to the questions of how to solve world problems due to the obvious shortage of ideas in the global space, lack of ideas on how to solve the problems of the Middle East, terrorism, nuclear non-proliferation, migration".
"And here the demand for the Russian vision becomes more and more obvious", Kosachev expressed confidence, stressing that in this sense he considers "the current session successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia".

The Minister added that Turkey has an opportunity to quickly solve the problem of withdrawal of militants of the banned in Russia organization Jabhat al-Nusra from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, RIA Novosti reported.
The Foreign Minister also stressed that Damascus will have to resort to a military solution to the problem of territories east of the Euphrates in case of Kurdish desire for separatism.
At the same time, according to Muallem, the negotiations with the Kurdish SDF forces were good until they were interrupted because of the United States.
On 17 September, Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan agreed to establish a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between the armed opposition and government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib by 15 October.

Vakhtang Kikabidze on the fight against cancer
Now many artists tell about how they managed to cope with cancer.
The disease, unfortunately, spares no one, and the stories of popular people about the victories over cancer, gives hope to many patients.
Famous actor Vakhtang Kikabidze admitted that he is alive only thanks to his wife.
Many years ago he was given a terrible diagnosis, which sounded like a sentence.
"I was hit on the skull with a hammer from below.
I fell.
Lost orientation.
They were taken to hospital.
There the spoon couldn't hold, couldn't stand, fell all the time.
We began to do tests, it turned out, bad things, the artery does not pass blood.

And during the operation, doctors saw a tumor behind the cyst",- said Kikabidze in the program" Once".
The tumor turned out to be malignant.
Then, 37 years ago, residents of Tbilisi even came to say goodbye to the idol on the doorstep of his house.
But the actor's wife did not allow the burial of a living actor, she believed that she could cope with the disease and more than a year did not leave the bed of her beloved husband.

In addition, the Foreign Minister of the neighboring country was found guilty of "direct threats of invasion of Ukraine" and "support for separatist sentiment in Ukraine", as well as participation "in the organization of provocation aimed at mass violation of Ukrainian law by Ukrainian citizens".
Note that before Szijjarto in the "Purgatory" landed deputy of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra Paul and the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) Onufriy.
The reason was their opposition to receiving Tomos by the Ukrainian local church.

The authorities called the amount of "golden parachute" Voronezh deputy governor
One-time payment of 23 salaries to the deputy governor of the Voronezh region Yuri Agibalov made on the basis of the regional law "On public office".
Thus the real sum of "golden parachute" released from a post of the acting official was several times less than the sum sounded in mass media.

As part of the general sexual education of children, this should be done by explaining the puzzle, because there is a certain risk to the sexual health of the child, both boy and girl.
The problem is objective, it is that children mature early enough, and then there are big scissors between their puberty and the ability to officially have sex.
According to Onishchenko, the solution to the problem is hampered by "hypocrisy", silence "problems of sexual age" and the lack of a culture of adequate education of children.
The doctor is sure that many teenagers face onanism.

AfD became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland is breaking another popularity record, and Angela Merkel's ratings are falling.
It seems that Germans are getting seriously tired of Angela Merkel's immigration policy, which has made the country a desirable target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
This is most evident in recent polls, according to which the anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) is gaining popularity and Merkel and Seehofer's ruling bloc are weakening.
This week, the AfD broke another record, rising to second place in the ranking of popular sympathy.
Right-wing conservatives with 17 percent of popularity managed to bypass the Social Democrats, who have about 16 percent.
The gap of one percentage point can be attributed to a statistical error, but it is worth noting the fact that the AfD, created in 2013 from a small group of Euroskeptic economists managed to turn into a serious political force.
The leadership in the overall ranking is still held by the ruling CSU/CDU bloc, which has about 30 percent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points - back in April, support for Angela Merkel's bloc was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German Chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48 percent of Germans support Angela Merkel, down 7 percent from last year.
The Social Democrats were followed by the Greens (15%), the Left (11%) and the Liberals (10%).
Evolution of "Alternatives"
The party "Alternative for Germany" was established in September 2012 on the basis of the group "Alternative choice 2013", which included people from the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially opposed the government's course, but initially dealt only with economic issues, including the euro and EU interaction.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany's "sponsorship" of weak EU economies, did not exclude the possibility of a return to the German brand and the country's complete withdrawal from the European Union.
As the immigration crisis deepened, the AfD's political platform expanded.
In 2013, the group became a full-fledged party, which took the niche of Euroskeptics and began to harshly criticize the government for the failure of immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the AfD managed to make its way to the Bundestag for the first time with 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of Alternative für Deutschland win seats in the European Parliament.
Published a video with a journalist who called the citizens of Ukraine "nation of bolvans"

"We have not been taught a culture of reading and acceptance of texts since childhood", the journalist said.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov's words, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee on Television and Radio Nezalezhnaya began to fight against literature, which has the slightest hint of criticism of the Kiev authorities, banning the import of as many as 201 editions.

The term of death of the universe is named
The universe will last another 140 billion years, ten times the age of the observed world of about 13.8 billion years.
Research of an international team of scientists posted in the library of electronic preprints arXiv.org and aimed at publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Experts came to such conclusions by observing about ten million galaxies with the help of the HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) camera of the Subaru telescope.
By tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 percent of the mass energy of the observed world, scientists, working within the standard cosmological model "Cold Dark Matter" ("Cold Dark Matter"), estimated the rate of expansion of the universe, which was a little slower than previously thought.
The press release of the Subaru Observatory noted that the observations provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, and the data of the European Space Telescope Planck clarified the restrictions imposed on the parameters of the CDM.
In July, scientists modeled the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new arguments that the observed world would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Great Divide.

Another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum failed
Opportunity to learn people's opinion on pension reform is postponed indefinitely
A meeting of the federal referendum initiative group against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups that registered different formulations of questions (the Central Election Commission registered five formulations in total).
They decided to apply to the CEC with a request to register a single initiative group and ask the Russians the question: "Are you in favor of not raising the age established by the legislation on pension provision as of July 1, 2018, after which Russian citizens get the right to an old-age pension?"
This wording was registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered the simplest and most legally capacious.
The majority of participants were supporters of Ilya Sviridov, a member of Just Russia (six subgroups) and the Communist Party (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Earlier Sviridov told "Vedomosti" that invitations were sent to all initiators, and representatives of about 40 subgroups agreed to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who heads the Vologda subgroup (her wording was supported by another 15 subgroups), told Vedomosti that she had not received an invitation and did not plan to come: "We did not understand who is a friend and who is an enemy".

In the match "Loko" - "Akhmat" mistakes Turbin poured out like from the horn of abundance
The former judge of the All-Union category Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of referee Evgeny Turbin in the match of the 9th round of the championship of Russia "Locomotive" - "Akhmat" and analyzed the controversial episodes of the game.
- How you estimate Evgeny Turbin's refereeing in a match "Locomotive" - "Akhmat"?
- I believe that this referee confirmed his unsuitability for refereeing matches of the Russian Premier League.
I am surprised that pressure in a meeting of the fifth round of "Spartak" - "Dynamo", neither Turbin, nor heads of DSI didn't draw serious conclusions about its low qualification.
The result didn't slow down to affect in the ninth round: Mistakes in his actions, private passes of rough receptions poured as from a horn of abundance.
For example, on the 50th minute of the railway Eder fills with hands in his penalty area defender "Akhmata" Rodolfo.
From a gate eight meters, but Turbin doesn't put penalty shootout.
- How you estimate an episode with participation to Idov who was on the 82nd minute when it seemed that the ball got to his hand?
- I believe that there was a deliberate play by the defender in his penalty area.
Turbin was close to the moment, and his first assistant on the right saw the episode well.
This moment had to see and reserve judge Sergei Karasev.
However, all three slept and no penalty was imposed.
Therefore the score in a match is distorted, and sports justice was violated.
It was that case when refereeing by concepts displaced and buried sports spirit of game.
- On the 52nd minute Turbin didn't dare to remove the defender of guests Oleg Ivanov who violated rules in fight against Kryhovyak and when the judge showed it a yellow card, demonstratively applauded it.
What do you think about this episode?
It was necessary to show the second "mustard man"?
- In this moment Turbin and the first yellow card showed not absolutely on business.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov told after a match about double standards of refereeing that to any teams put penalty shootout for such violations, as in an episode with Idov, and any isn't present.
What do you assess the football player's words?
- Watching what to mean by double standards.
There was a penalty.
He was not given.
It means that the referee does not give a second penalty in the opposite gate.
Here is the principle that is used.
And the second point of double standards is that the referee looks who plays.

Matt Damon played accused of rape Judge Kavanaugh at SNL launch
American actor Matt Damon played U.S. Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first season of Saturday Night Live on NBC.
In a small sketch, the actor played Kavanaugh at a Senate hearing on charges of rape.
The U.S. Supreme Court nominee has previously attracted attention for his emotionality and detail of his stories during a conversation with Senator Amy Klobuchar.
Thus, Kavanaugh repeatedly confessed his love for beer, but said that he had never drunk to the point of oblivion.
In addition, in an attempt to plead guilty to charges of rape, Kavanaugh claimed that he was a virgin at the time.
Those moments were also beaten by Damon.
I only did that much drank and at all didn't think of sex.
I was the proudest, most drunk virgin anyone had ever seen.
Everyone knows this",- said the judge performed by Matt Damon.
Kavanaugh had previously been elected US chief justice.
But pay attention to the face and body language of everyone in this fuzzy picture, and you will feel that they are all playing.
But my advice to you is to tell them that they behaved badly and fled, and apologize.
Nothing, it is a soccer match, against Afula, we won though the judge was the Jew.
Barbra Streisand discovered strange behavior in her cloned dogs
American singer Barbra Streisand said that the clones of her dead dog behave completely differently from the original pet.
"They are different.
In fact, [clones] look like her, but it is impossible to clone the soul",- said the 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old cat-de-tulear dog named Samantha, who had to fall asleep due to health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that the dog breed Chihuahua nicknamed Miracle Milly (Miracle Milly), who was called the smallest dog in the world, cloned for the 49th time.
Specialists are cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
U.S. thinks about naval blockade of Russia because of oil and gas supplies
The United States may begin a naval blockade of Russia to gain an advantage in the world energy market.
The U.S. authorities are so eager to fight for success in the world hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to the naval blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world's main energy suppliers.
U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke told about the possibility of a naval blockade the day before.
Contrary to world practice, the U.S. Department of the Interior does not perform police, but civilian functions, including the implementation of natural resources policy.
Therefore, Zinke's statement came quite within the competence of his department, although it was not deprived of political color.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that thanks to the Navy, the U.S. controls the sea lanes in the Middle East region and can block them if necessary.
According to Zinke, the need may be related to Washington's desire to prevent Russian supplies to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia still receives the lion's share of its revenues from supplies to the world market of oil and gas.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motive for Moscow's activation in this region, Zinke said.
The Minister made it clear that the United States still expects to secure leadership in the world energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do this, Washington will have to push Russia and Iran, and the sea blockade of trade routes - an acceptable measure along the way, said Zinke.
"I have come to tell you that I am leaving for Moscow tomorrow and will not return to this house again, and you will have news of my decision through a lawyer to whom I will entrust the divorce".

Supersonic passenger aircraft in Russia will be put into serial production
Mass production of supersonic passenger aircraft in Russia will begin after 2030.
This was stated by Director General of the Central Aerodynamic Institute named after Zhukovsky Kirill Sypalo.

Expensive violin handed over to a pawnshop for a priceless price
When a man brought a violin to the LBC Boutique and Loan pawnshop in Somerville, Massachusetts, a pawnshop worker offered only $50 for an old and unpresentable instrument.
But experienced store manager Dylan McDermitt suspected that it is an ancient and expensive tool, and sought advice from an expert.
It turned out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violin master Ferdinando Gagliano and is estimated at 250 thousand dollars.
Only bonds to the violin are estimated at 16-18 thousand dollars.
The investigation revealed that the violin was recently stolen from a resident of the city, and the instrument was returned to its rightful owner.
It is not yet known how the violin got to the person who handed it over to a pawnshop, but he is not listed for any previous clashes with the law.
The manager says that now all those who bring the violin to the pawnshop will be asked to play it to make sure that it really belongs to the client.

"I hope they will also support, because now almost every game is full stadium, great atmosphere.
On game, probably, the Lord helped "Siberia" because very roughly were mistaken, especially our leaders.
In general lost micro - match 0: 3 our leading leaders therefore it was difficult to us to pull out this match though there were moments.
But, nevertheless, after all I will assume guilt.
Because, probably missed, something in preparation.
Compared to the last match it was a different team".

"This is ugly nepotism"
The audience is outraged by Agutin's choice on the show "Voice"
The audience of the show "Voice of 60 +" accuses mentor Leonid Agutin of "ugly nepotism and brazen fraud".
When in blind auditions he recognized the voice of his father Nikolai Agutin from the first notes, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not turn to the performer.
But son's feelings took over, and he chose the relative in the team.
Then many considered it as joke, but forgave to the instructor bias at the first stage.
But the "joke" dragged on, and the star's father absolutely unjustifiably took the place of more worthy performers.
And now already the audience isn't ready to forgive Agutin of such injustice.
Yesterday we, the audience of the show, were indignant at the cronyism of the ugly and frank dragging of our close relatives to the final ladder.
I already even doubted that Agutin will have enough strength and conscience not to drag up to the end the father absolutely already to the first place",- Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina in the Man from TV program reasoned.
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father Leonid Agutin "merged" beautiful performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining that the audience wants to see his father in the show.
But, as it appeared, it at all so, the audience wants an objective assessment and to see in the ending of really talented performers, and now Agutin discredited show.
"I sympathize with the participants of" Golos "from Agutin's team - they were doomed".
"Last time Agutin showed how he loves the father, and today had to prove to be the professional".
"The contest has lost its meaning".
"To remove from the project two talented people and to leave in the project the father who doesn't sing and whispers, how it is possible to call after that the instructor?",
"I like the way dad sings, organize a concert in the Kremlin for his own money and see how many people will come to this concert".
This is the show "Voice", not the show "Cool relatives".
"It was unprofessional on Agutin's part".
"Then you have to offer to play your dad on your own show, not on a show that is made with Channel 1 money".
"It was a real chance for someone, and it took someone's place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad should make me understand more than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why the worker from Surgut with magnificent voice and timbre merged, and father Agutin brought to the ending?
And then we all complain that on stage and from the screens the same faces for decades!

Users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional "Voice" on the blind auditions came the son of Gradsky.
Then to a meter and in the head didn't come to take the son in own team.
Moreover, he said",Come on, come from here, everything is clear".
Agutin couldn't act as the professional.

It is enough only to look at "Severodvinsk", - quotes The National Interest Rear Admiral Dave Johnson.
At the same time, the publication writes that the United States retains an advantage in this industry over Russia.
Multi-purpose nuclear submarines "Kazan", "Novosibirsk", "Krasnoyarsk" and "Arkhangelsk" are built according to the improved project "Yasen-M" (885M).
They have a displacement of 13,800 tons, dive depth - 520 m, crew - 64 people, autonomy - 100 days, underwater speed - 31 knots.
The submarines are armed with mines, 533 mm torpedoes, Onyx and Calibre cruise missiles.

Carrera's actions were absolutely absurd.
To pay attention to such things is nonsense.

Pupils of "Sirius" discussed with scientists nature-like technologies
Pupils of the educational center "Sirius" in Sochi, participants of the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists of the national research center "Kurchatov Institute".
The speech of researchers took place in the framework of the Global International Forum of Convergent and Nature-like Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the website of the educational center on September 29.
The lecture was opened by a documentary film "Kurchatov Codes", during which the president of the Kurchatov Institute, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Mikhail Kovalchuk spoke about global challenges as a driving force for the development of civilization.
The lecture of the scientist is published on the website of "Sirius".
The students learned that modern technologies need a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet able to develop such volumes.
According to the organizers of the forum, nature-like technologies, on which young scientists are working today, will help to solve this problem.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of nature-like technologies, as well as spoke about the risks that inevitably arise in the creation of such technologies.
"The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, it is a colossal benefit.
It is explosive growth of medical technologies, it is improvement of quality of life and infrastructure.
But there is a second side.
The development of nature-like technologies is actually a technological reproduction of wildlife systems.
There is a downside - purposeful interference in human life.
There are always risks.
There was a car - people began to die under the wheels.
But cars are still used.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I create medical new technology, and thus I can create weapons of mass destruction",- quotes the scientist REN TV.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, the students were able to ask questions to the participants of the meeting.
The speakers were Yulia Diakova, Candidate of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Head of the Kurchatov complex of NBICS-like technologies of the Kurchatov Institute, and Vyacheslav Demin, Head of the Kurchatov complex of NBICS technologies.
Educational center "Sirius" in Sochi was created by the educational fund "Talent and Success" on the basis of the Olympic infrastructure at the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The purpose of the educational center is early identification, development and further professional support of gifted children.
Earlier in September, it was reported that the winners of the All-Russian online Olympiad in Information Security "Cybercall" will be sent for training to "Sirius".

Macedonia: Referendum failed due to low turnout
The referendum was intended to approve an agreement between the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country "Northern Macedonia".
Greece objected to the use of the name of its historic province by Macedonians.
The renaming promised the former Yugoslav Republic an opening to NATO and later to the EU.
But, according to EFE, only 34% of the turnout in Sunday's plebiscite "fell short" of the constitutional threshold of 50%.
However, since the referendum was only consultative, it is possible that the authorities in Skopje will decide not to refuse the renaming.
Speaking shortly after the closure of polling stations, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a supporter of changing the name of the republic, said that if there is more "yes" among the votes cast, Macedonia will change its name, despite the unachieved quorum.

Kemerovo residents were outraged by the herd of sheep in the cemetery
On September 30 on the well-known Kemerovo page in a social network there was a message from the eyewitness that on one of local cemeteries horned animals freely walk.
The animals walked among the fences and plucked the grass.
Commentators have expressed different opinions: One of the local residents noted that in the presence of small cattle in the cemetery there is no harm, and their appetite can even help in clearing the area of weeds and grass, but some of the residents of the behavior of animals did not like:
"These are graves, not pastures.
The sheep have nothing to do there.
About rams, of course, you won't tell that they blasphemy, but nevertheless not business it".(Style is kept) - the indignant resident of Kemerovo noted in the message.
In any case, one of the eyewitnesses noted that the problem of animals in the middle of the cemetery is already known, and soon the necessary measures will be taken.

To push and to win - how it is correct?
The word push does not exist.
It is correct - to dominate.
The word "push" in the sense of "pull, influence, influence" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "pull".
We use this word thinking that it comes from the word "pressure".
But "pressure" and "dominance" are etymologically not only not close, but even in a sense opposite.
See for yourself.
It is enough to be sufficient for someone or something, to satisfy.
To be content, pleasure - related words.
It used to have the meaning "not to depend on anything, to have a self-sufficient meaning" - "to dominate".
The Old Slavonic word "dovleti" is related to the words "command" and "will".
To press, to suppress - absolutely others.
These words have truly frightening "relatives": DAOS - "wolf" (crushing sheep), deyja - "die" and dvaidī - "oppress".
The similar phonetic appearance of the words "pressure" and "dominate", as well as the imminent obsolescence of the latter, forced them into conflict.
So we have this very "d [a] fly", which is used in writing through "a", which, in a good way, is wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of emergence and development of these words.
So, it is correct - to dominate.
But this word is outdated, in its proper meaning is no longer used.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people have a negative impact on you from above, use the word "pressure".
You can also use the "apply pressure" design, but remember that this is the office.

Vucic maintained the highest level of combat readiness of the Serbian army
Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic ordered to maintain the highest level of combat readiness to which the country's Armed Forces were brought due to the situation in the north of the autonomous province of Kosovo and Metohija.
"The President ordered to maintain the highest level of combat readiness, its cancellation will be a separate order", - said on Sunday, Serbian Defense Minister Alexander Vulin, quoted by TASS.
According to him, the head of state is deeply concerned about the events in Kosovo.
At the same time, Vulin boasted, the President of the Republic expressed "pleasure with the energy, work, readiness and speed of the Serbian military".
Vucic himself said yesterday that he intends to discuss the situation in Kosovo and Metohija with Russian President Vladimir Putin and ask the Russian leader for support.
According to available data, the meeting is scheduled for October 2 and should take place in Moscow.
At the same time, the Serbian leader stressed that he will do everything to preserve peace and noted that he would like his country to be a peaceful, economically successful country of the future.

This was in connection with the visit to the north of Kosovo of President Hashim Thaci.

With the help of the operation in Syria, Russia has protected itself from terrorists
During the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, about 100,000 terrorists were killed, of whom 85,000 were killed by the Russian Air and Space Forces.
This was told in connection with the third anniversary of the beginning of the Russian military operation in Syria, former commander of the Air Force, head of the Federation Council Committee on Defense and Security Viktor Bondaryev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of means of destruction from the air: Aerospace forces struck and continue to strike all strikes exactly at terrorist targets.
According to Bondaryev, tens of thousands of terrorist targets have been destroyed in Syria in three years, such as ammunition depots, fortifications and headquarters.
With the help of Russian air strikes, the defense of jihadists was hacked - this was a decisive contribution to the advancement of Syrian government troops, Interfax reported.
At the same time, according to Bondaryev, the operation of our military in Syria allowed to protect Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (ISIS, banned in Russia) and Jabhat al-Nusra (banned in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, on the side of ISIS fought about four thousand militants from among the Russian citizens and about five thousand citizens of post-Soviet countries, reports TASS.
And we are talking only about the registered persons, not including those who have not been identified, said Bondaryev.
Most of them were trained and ready to take up arms at any moment, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter the territory of our country.
Thus, said Bondaryev, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism on distant borders - otherwise this evil "would flow to us".

Phones of Boris Johnson and a number of British ministers are in the public domain
Personal data of a number of former and current British ministers are in the public domain because of a failure in the security application, created by the Conservative Party, reports Sky News.
In particular, the mobile phone numbers of Finance Minister Philip Hammond and former British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson were available.
According to the TV channel, several politicians received "unpleasant calls".
The technical problem has been fixed and the application is now safe to use.
We are investigating the causes of the failure and apologize for any problems caused",- said in the Conservative Party.
During the failure, users could not only see confidential data, but also edit information in the profiles of politicians and journalists.

Syria has accused the U.S. of supporting terrorism
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem accused the United States and its partners of war crimes in Syria and support for terrorism.
The [Western] coalition has completely destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqa, it has destroyed infrastructure and public services in the areas against which it has targeted, it has committed mass killings of civilians, including children and women.
These killings are war crimes under international law",he said.
According to Muallem, the United States and its partners provided "direct support to the terrorists", as the goals of the militants and the Western coalition in Syria coincided and meant "sowing chaos, death and destruction in their path".
The Foreign Minister also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria is almost over, and the country has become more secure and stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intends to cleanse Syria of illegal foreign presence, and priority in the reconstruction of the country will be given to Syrian partners.

Some five million people have fled to other countries, most notably neighbouring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
Now, according to Damascus, the fighting is nearing its end, and the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees.
This was stated by Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem, speaking at the UN: "Currently, the situation on the ground has become more stable and secure due to the successes achieved in the fight against terrorism.
The Government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists, bringing them back to normal life.

The Syrian authorities also called on the international community to facilitate the return of refugees and provide funds for this.

Metropolitan Hilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename the UOC with the actions of fascists
Metropolitan Hilarion, head of the Synodal Department for External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate into the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists against Jews.
"It is like in fascist Germany to aim a yellow pointed star at a Jew, it means to mark the Church as an enemy organization, and it is for this purpose that this bill was created", - said the Metropolitan on the TV channel "Russia-24" (quote from Interfax).
In his opinion, this step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is in an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to gain full control over the UOC and "outlaw it", believes the clergyman.
"It is the Ukrainian church, and believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of the country", - he added.
Earlier it became known that the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on the implementation of bills № 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), № 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and № 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter involves renaming the UOC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
When the plan appeared, it was surprisingly simple and straightforward.

The deputy of the Pochaev Lavra called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
Metropolitan Vladimir, deputy of the Holy Dormition Pochaev Lavra, called for the protection of the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian holy places.
The text of his appeal to the faithful of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) published on Saturday on the website of the monastery.
At different times in history, our predecessors and Christian relatives had to confess their faith and defend their holy places.
Taking into account the situation that has developed, and the information we have, and the death threats that are spreading, it is clear that we will have to endure something",- said the Metropolitan.
He asked for support - prayer, moral.
The Lavra's deputy also stressed that it is likely that "your physical presence will be needed".
The clergyman added: "Lenin's grandchildren - in spirit, threaten to kill, and therefore protect their sacred".
Those who care about the fate of the Pochaev Lavra - an Orthodox Ukrainian and world shrine - should be ready to protect it, the appeal reads.
The Metropolitan urged not to follow the example of those who mislead believers.
UOC has canonical status, determined by Tomos on October 29, 1990 from the Mother Church.
And now someone wants to make dependent on the news patriarch and friend of the Catholic Pope Bartholomew.
The new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us Orthodox.
And we are satisfied with the status that our church has",- said the deputy Lavra.
He recalled that the UOC since October 1990 is canonically independent and completely independent in its management.
There is no administrative or financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact Tomos our church already has.
What other Tomos do we need? "- noted Metropolitan Vladimir of Pochaev, urging the faithful and all citizens to ask whether other confessions have Tomos, are they independent of the Vatican?
Believers to some extent understood and decided in what temple they go.
However, someone wants to sow enmity and discord again.
Some are fed up with envy that the domes shine on the temples that they want to destroy",- said the priest.

The Lavra is located on the top of the Pochaev mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopil.
The first historical information about it dates back to the beginning of the 13th century.

All the money he decided to direct to charity.

Every resident of Kalmykia is a debtor
Residents of the republic increasingly visit the official website of the Office of the Federal Bailiff Service of Russia in the Republic of Kazakhstan.

But debtors can expect negative consequences in the form of, for example, a ban on travel abroad.
That is why UFSSP of Russia in the Republic of Kazakhstan recommends all those who have planned a trip abroad, to clarify in the department of bailiffs at the place of residence or on the site www.r08fssprus.ru information about the presence of unpaid debts and repay them.
The service has created a "database of enforcement proceedings" for the convenience of citizens.
This special electronic application is available not only on the regional sites UFSSP of Russia, but also in social networks and mobile communications iPad, iPhone and smartphone.
The database contains information on enforcement proceedings initiated by Kalmyk bailiffs against all debtors, - explains Delgir Bodgaeva, Assistant Head of the Federal Service of the Russian Federation for the Republic of Kazakhstan.

The main Macedonian opposition refused to vote in the referendum
Macedonia is holding a referendum on Sunday, 30 September, on an intergovernmental treaty with Greece to rename the Republic of Macedonia.
Citizens are asked to answer one question: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?"
Nevertheless, the leader of the leading opposition party "Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity" (VMRO-DPNE) Christian Mitskoski said that he would not vote in the referendum.
As explained by party spokesman Naum Stoilkovsky, Mitskoski decided to abstain from voting to express his disagreement with the treaty, which he considers "harmful".
According to the spokesman, the current referendum resolves the issue of renaming the country and nothing more, while the strategic goal of the party - to achieve membership in NATO and the EU.
A week ago, Macedonian President Gheorghe Ivanov also refused to participate in the September 30 referendum.
He explained that he chose the name for the country 27 years ago in a referendum on independence.
"A new semi-sovereign state with a new name is being created", Ivanov said.
The agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic - the Republic of Northern Macedonia - was signed by the Foreign Ministers of Macedonia and Greece on June 17 this year during a ceremony on the shore of Lake Prespa, which is the border between the two countries.
This treaty should resolve the long-standing dispute over the name of the country, as well as Skopje's path to NATO and the EU, reminds TASS.
In the restaurant of Istanbul "chef from the meme" there was a fire
In the Istanbul restaurant Nusret, whose chef Nusret Gekce became famous for the manner of salting steaks and became a hero of the meme, there was a fire during a fire show with dishes, reports Sputnik.
According to preliminary data, the waiter confused additives for meat steaks prepared on fire.
As a result, the fire was even stronger and spread to the guests sitting at the bar counter.
Five people, two waiters and three tourists from the Czech Republic, were reportedly severely burned.
At the same time, the Czech Foreign Ministry said that suffered only two Czech tourists.
According to the Foreign Ministry, the injured woman recorded burns of 35% of the body, a man - 15%, writes "RIA Novosti".
These are second-degree burns, and in women - with deep penetration into the skin structure.
Turkish chef Nusret Gekce is known on the Internet for his exquisite way to sprinkle steaks with salt and spices.
It was reported that he ordered a large-scale PR campaign in various countries, in which Leonardo DiCaprio visited the restaurant Nusret in Dubai.
On April 1, a fire broke out in the Old Barn Inn in Kazan.
The fire engulfed the roof of a two-storey building on an area of 450 square meters.

EU allocates €1.5 million to help victims in Indonesia
The European Union (EU) has allocated €1.5 million to Indonesia to deal with the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami.
This was reported by the press service of the European Commission on September 30.
The European Commission has sent experts to the region to monitor aid.
As noted, the funds will be used for disinfection, as well as providing victims with food, water, temporary shelters and medicines.
The Commission also provided Indonesian authorities with access to satellite maps of the European Emergency Service Copernicus ("Copernicus") to assess the damage.
The United States also expressed its readiness to assist in eliminating the consequences of the disaster, said in a statement distributed by the head of the press service of the U.S. Department of State Heather Nauert.
It is also reported that the U.S. diplomatic mission in Indonesia has not received reports of injured American citizens.

U.S. is satisfied with the growth of opiate production in Afghanistan
The sharp escalation of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26 was much discussed in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations involving Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, which was represented by Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, on Afghan territory militants unleashed a real terrorist war against the state authorities and the civilian population of the country.
This year was a record year in the number of bloody terrorist attacks, which killed thousands of ordinary Afghans",Patrushev said.
Afghanistan's troubles did not begin yesterday.
After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the main enemy of the United States was declared a terrorist group "Al Qaeda" (banned in the Russian Federation), settled in Afghanistan.
Less than a month later, America and NATO allies launched Operation Enduring Freedom there.
Seventeen years have passed.
Thousands of American troops are still on Afghan soil.
And the peaceful life is even more ghostly than it was then.
American troops are driven behind the fences of dozens of their bases.
As they can, they buy off the militants for money if they are not touched.
The government of Afghanistan controls a smaller part of the country - 40%, according to Patrushev.
50% - the Taliban (banned in Russia).
Another 10% - for ISIS terrorists (banned in the Russian Federation).
But they are growing fast there.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia - exactly what they failed in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be comfortable with this.
It is also gratifying that the production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased by at least 40 times over the 17 years of the American presence.
An enormous increase in the area sown with opium poppy and multi-billion dollar profits.

Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on EU and NATO membership, provided the name of the country is changed.
The agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia into the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on 17 June as a result of long negotiations with neighbouring Greece, which refused to recognize the right of its northern neighbour to be called Macedonia as an attempt on the Greek province of the same name and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovski, political scientist: "Thanks to this agreement Macedonia or Northern Macedonia gets the right to a better future, hope for social changes.
And Greece will entrench the right to its past.
There are no ideal agreements.
They arise from difficult compromises and cannot make absolutely everyone happy".
The ruling Social Democrats, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, are in favor of renaming the country.
Against - the conservative opposition and President Gheorghe Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetina Chilimanov, Macedonia does not make sense to join the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with it: "Many of those who do not like the agreement, believe that the current socialist government led by Zaev imposed from outside in order to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, loss of sovereignty.
It is obvious that there are countries that would not like Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans".
FEI Dulgheri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the biggest challenge in its history.
The country is at a crossroads.
The choices Macedonia's citizens make will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but of Europe as a whole".
At this moment it seemed to him that the peak lady squinted
