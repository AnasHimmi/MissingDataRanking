Number of new recruits from Ukraine preparing to be sent to Donbass
Official representative of the People's Police of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic (LNR) Andrei Marochko stated that in the winter of 2018-2019 Ukraine will send no less than 3 thousand recruits to Donbass.
According to him, in this way Kiev plans to "although somehow complete its divisions."
"The reluctance of citizens of Ukraine to serve in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, mass layoffs have led to low staffing of units," said Marochko, who is quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that the actual numbers of Ukrainians called into the army could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched a so-called antiterrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced with a joint force operation (JOS).
It was assumed that this measure would lead to a strengthening of the role of Ukrainian security forces in the settlement of the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbass worsened due to the murder of the head of the DPR, Alexander Zakharchenko.
The authorities of the DPR qualified the incident as a terrorist attack.
During the criminal investigation several people involved in the explosion were detained.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the sabotage was organized by Ukrainian intelligence agencies.

British FM compares EU with Soviet Union and prison
British foreign minister Jeremy Hunt compared the EU with the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of capturing member states.
The diplomat made such a statement at a congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, September 30.
As the Daily Mail notes, so Hunt commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiations.
What happened to faith in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave it.
The lesson of history is clear: if you turn the EU from a community into a prison, then the desire to leave it will not decrease, but only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to escape captive," the minister said.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for the decision to leave the European Union will only exacerbate the crisis, notes Gazeta.ru.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Theresa May said negotiations on Brexit had reached a deadlock.
So she commented on the results of the informal EU summit in Salzburg.
Brexit was decided in 2016 following the referendum.
The United Kingdom is expected to leave until April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by many factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
Moreover, the issue of the Irish border remains open.
Further information on European water policy as well as the full text of legislation and other documents is available on the Commission's website.6

The hunter breed of Phunsan from North Korean wolves received its name from one of the districts of the DPRK.
As the agency notes, Moon loves animals, he already has two such dogs, which he was given by North Korean leader Kim Jong Il.
Dogs are not the only present.
Kim Jong-un also handed his colleague two tons of matsutake mushrooms.

Head of the Altai village council stopped hunger strike in defence of the interests of residents
The deputy announced on his Facebook page that he stopped starving for several reasons.
The head of the village council stated that the situation has reached a deadlock, the district administration does not respond to his demands, and he needs to carry out his work.
In addition, the prosecutor's office began to check the situation, and the heat supply organization STPK promised to begin work on preparing the system for the winter heating season in the village of Siberian next week.
Also, residents of the village council made up and took away the governor of the Altai Territory a mass collective treatment "on the current catastrophic situation".
Boronin himself said that he felt well; he fulfilled his duties as head of the hunger strike in full.
As Boronin explained, the villages of Siberia and Rogulichny have centralized heating systems, and, as such, the administration of Pervomaisk district should exercise the powers to prepare them for winter.
However, until now, no one has started this work.
The head of the village council also protested against the lack of proper control and support from the government of Altai Krai and against the financial policy of Gazprommezhregiongaz Novosibirsk.
In addition to the proper preparation of villages for the winter, Boronin demanded "immediately to organize a full-fledged independent section of public utilities with corresponding staff units within the municipality."

New buildings in Moscow with the cheapest apartments named
In the first half of 2018, about three thousand units of housing, ranging from 30 square metres and costing up to four million roubles, were purchased in new buildings in Moscow.
Two LCDs accounted for more than half of such transactions, according to materials from the Urbanus portal (there is Lenta.ru at the disposal).
The leaders in terms of sales of housing in the budget up to four million roubles were the Nekrasovka residential complex, located behind the MKAD, near Kotelniki (YuVAO), and the Barbaris apartment complex near Bibirevo (SVAO).
Two residential complexes in New Moscow - South Bunino and Maple Alleys - were also noticeable in the structure of transactions with budget housing.
Urbanus analysts note that the share of transactions with apartments in these new buildings reaches 60 percent of all sales and provides half of total revenue.
"It is necessary to recognise the influence of apartments with a budget of less than four million roubles on the commercial successes of the "Central" microdistrict in "New Vatutinka" and the "Filatov Lug" residential complex," the study says about two more New Moscow residential complexes.
At their expense, about 35 percent of the volume of financial income is formed.
Previously, the rating of districts of Moscow with the cheapest apartments in new buildings was presented in the estate agency "Bon Ton".
According to the company, the lowest prices for primary housing (149.9 thousand roubles per metre) were recorded in SWAA in September 2018.
The second and third places were taken by HAO and SWAO with figures of 184.1 and 192.8 thousand roubles, respectively.

Telegram users complain about new version failure
iPhone users complained about problems with the Telegram messenger after an update on September 28.
The user's phone number can be found on his/her username
Complaints concern gadgets with the current iOS 12 operating system.
According to their owners, after the update, the application shows a white screen or closes immediately.
Representatives of the messenger reacted to the failure.
According to them, the problem may be related to the migration of information to a new application written in the Swift language.
Telegram has temporarily suspended automatic update of the application until troubleshooting.
On April 13, the Tagansk court of Moscow sued Roskomnadzor for blocking the Telegram messenger in Russia.
Three days later, communications operators began to implement the decision.
The reason was the failure of the messenger administration to provide the FSB with the keys to decipher the correspondence needed to obtain data about terrorists.
In August, Telegram changed its privacy policy and agreed to disclose the IP address and mobile phone number of a terrorist suspect when receiving a suit.
Telegram audience reduced by 1.2 million after blocking in Russia

I am glad for the guys who came out to realize the numerical advantage in the match against Minsk's Dinamo
Bob Hartley: I am glad for the guys who came out to realize the numerical advantage in the match against Dinamo in Minsk
Head Coach of Avant-garde Bob Hartley summed up the KHL regular championship match against Minsk's Dynamo (2:1).
A very important victory for us.
After the match in Saint Petersburg, we held a meeting and agreed that we should leave this game behind and prepare for Minsk.
They knew that Dinamo had a good victory before our meeting, so they prepared very seriously.
It was important to give up the majority, I am happy for the guys who came out for the implementation of the numerical advantage.
Lately we played well in the majority, but we couldn't score.
Finally, the red light behind the gate lit.
We knew that Minsk would get loaded into the game, would try and it turned out to be so.
The game, in the majority, became a defining one, and we scored in unequal parts.
We managed to spend the third period well today, despite the fact that we missed the early goal in this section and it was clear that it would not be easy in the future.
But we played very well in defence, we didn't give a lot of chance to the rival, we didn't allow us to be caught on shifts, "Dynamo" didn't have attacks with a numerical advantage, so everything ended well for us, says the press service of the Omsk club.

"Angi" deserved luck in the game with us
Head Coach for Saint Petersburg's Zenit Sergei Semak commented on his team's first defeat this season.
In the ninth round of the Russian championship in football, the blue-white-blue guests lost to Makhachkala's "Anzhi" with a score of 1:2.
There are no underestimations, there are two teams playing, and the same guys have once again shown that success should be deserved.
Naturally, luck was on the side of "Ange" - both penalty and goal.
It is clear that this was preceded by our crude mistakes," Semaka quotes the Championship.com as saying.
Also the head coach of "Zenit" noted that his footballers in the first half with the Makhachkala team acted very slowly, allowing the opponent to create many goals.
Let us recall that the Makhachkala "Anzhi" at home defeated "Zenit" with a score of 2:1, defeating the leader of the championship this season.

The driver of the team "Mersedes" Lewis Hamilton, who became the winner of the 16th stage of the championship "Formula-1" Grand Prix of Russia, jokingly promised not to please the President of Russia Vladimir Putin with champagne souls, as in 2015.

RBC announced the imminent resignation of the Governor of Kurgan region
Governor of Kurgan region Aleksei Kokorin will resign as part of a new rotation of the governor's corps, RBC reports citing two sources close to the presidential administration.
The decision will be officially announced in the near future, the publication notes.
One of the main reasons for Mr Kokorin's departure is that the region has remained depressed with a low level of social and economic development.
Alexei Kokorin has not yet served his first term as governor, and his powers expire in 2019.
He was elected in September 2014 with 84.87% of the vote.

Elon Musk is forced to resign as Tesla's chief executive
The US Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla founder Elon Musk settled their dispute in the fraud case.
CNBC News reports this.
According to the television channel, as part of the reached agreements, Maska will have to leave the post of head of the board of directors of Tesla.
Moreover, the commission allowed Makka to maintain the post of head of Tesla.
As noted, the founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
A similar amount will be recovered from Tesla.
Moreover, the money will be distributed among the injured investors.
Furthermore, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Elon Musk is an American entrepreneur on Forbes' list of the world's 50 richest people.
He is the head of SpaceX, the neurotechnical company Neuralink and designer of Tesla electric cars, as well as co-founder of Paypal.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had previously sued Tesla's CEO, Ilona Musk, over his twitter account of a possible buyout.
Last month, Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy back all shares on the stock exchange at a fixed price of $420.
The cost of the action of $420 was set ostensibly "due to the importance of this number in the culture of marijuana," Bloomberg previously reported citing the Commission's co-director, Stephen Peikin.
Moreover, Elon Musk subsequently abandoned his plans to buy back shares.
Commenting on the suit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission against him, the businessman stated that he considers accusations of fraud unjustified and added that he is very disappointed and saddened by these claims.
"Honesty is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I have not violated it in any way," the businessman said in an interview with CNBC.
Moreover, in August, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a collective suit against Musk, complaining about the financial losses incurred.
The plaintiffs claimed that the office of a businessman had brought them losses.
In particular, one of the shareholders said that the businessman's tweets were misleading, which forced sellers of Tesla shares to buy paper at artificially inflated prices to cover their positions.
Other plaintiffs also noted that Ilon Musk's careless remarks led to sharp exchange rate fluctuations.
In September, Ilona Musk also accused the head of research company Citron Research of exchange frauds.
Meanwhile, if Musk were not able to settle his dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, he would face removal from the management of the company and even prison.
In particular, former chairman of the commission, Harvey Pitt, told CNBC about this.

According to him, now that "the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is in an acute stage," renaming the church is like in fascist Germany "taking a yellow six-final star."
"This means labelling the church as an enemy organization, and this bill was created precisely for this purpose," said a representative of the Russian Orthodox Church on the television channel Russia 24.
The Metropolitan also stressed that the UOC is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian one, since "believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainian, they are patriots of their country."

Grand Prix in Sochi: sold-out, Russian car and return of Kvyat
Over the next ten years, Russia may have its own racing car.
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak announced this, summing up the results of the meeting with Russian automobile manufacturers on the eve of the start of the Russian Grand Prix in Sochi.
Also, the Deputy Prime Minister shared his opinion on the return of Daniel Kvyat to Toro Rosso and assessed the attendance of the Russian Phase of Formula One.
The result of our meeting with automobile manufacturers should become in the foreseeable future just the creation of the Russian car, Formula 1, which has no analogues in the world, stated Dmitry Kozak.
We must stimulate our automakers in this direction.
It was about plans until 2024, but I do not think that in such periods it is possible.
I think a more realistic timeframe is over the next ten years."
From 2012 to 2014, the Marusya team performed under a Russian license in Formula 1.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there are already investors ready to invest in the creation of a domestic team in the World Championship in racing in the Formula One class.
I know that in Russia there are fans of automobile sports, wealthy businessmen who are willing to invest, ready to invest in the creation of the Russian team "Formula-1", he noted.
"We are ready to support them morally.
Let's hope we have such a team.
I suspect that thoughts about creating a team also emerged because such infrastructure has emerged in Sochi."
Tomorrow, Sochi Avtodrom is waiting for a bustle.
According to Dmitry Kozak, the organizers managed to sell all 50 thousand tickets.
Look, even the qualifications of the stands were almost completed, noted the Deputy Prime Minister.
I can say that revenue this year increased by 72% compared to last year.
This is a good, positive result.
We are also preparing an action plan to improve the effectiveness of the use of Sochi Avtodrom infrastructure throughout the year.
It will be an additional tourist product that will make Sochi even more attractive.
Dmitry Kozak also did not avoid the main theme of the day for Russian motorsport fans: the return of Daniel Kvyat to Toro Rosso.
We all together greet Daniel and wish him success next season, said Deputy Prime Minister to Izvestia.
He is a hopeful driver.
Next year, for the first time in history, two major Russian pilots will be able to participate in the Formula 1 peloton.

His contract with Williams ends at the end of the season and the results are still not impressive: he took 18th place in the Russian Grand Prix qualification.
Let's hope that next season our main pilots will be more than this year, stated Dmitry Kozak.

More than 100 prisoners fled prison in Indonesia after the earthquake
More than 100 inmates fled the prison in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia.
The escape became possible after two major earthquakes on the island with a magnitude of 7.2 and 7.4.
As the newspaper The Jakarta Post writes, the incident occurred on September 28, when the detainees in Palu city prison demanded that they be released in connection with the underground tremors.
More than 340 inmates staged a riot and set the facility on fire.
Police officers who arrived in place of the emergency partially took the situation under control, but more than 100 people fled the prison.
The building itself was seriously damaged and guards struggled to hold prisoners.
The number of victims of the earthquake and the tsunami that occurred on the island of Sulawesi increased to 832 people.
In this regard, transportation, electricity and communications to certain areas of the island are still not possible.
And I fear that with so many of these cases, it is only a form.

"Golden Pearl" for "extreme realism"
The San Sebastian International Film Festival recognised the Spanish film film for the third time in history.
The main award - "Golden shell" - was awarded the drama "Between Two Seas" by director Isaac Lacuesta.
This film, with almost documentary realism, tells the difficult story of the lives of two brothers in the Spanish coastal province of Cadiz - Laquesta presented a sequel to his 2006 film, Legend of Time.
At the awards ceremony of the film festival in San Sebastian, the creators of the Argentine thriller "Red" were honored, which was marked in several nominations at once.
Benjamin Naishtat was announced director of the year, Pedro Sotero was awarded for his camera work, and Dario Grandinette was recognised as the best actor.
Pia Tielta from Norway became the actress of the year at the film festival in San Sebastian.
The jury praised her participation in the film "The blind spot" - a drama about the life of one family after the attempted suicide of a daughter.
The film became the directorial debut of Swedish actress Tuva Novotna.
"Yuli" and "Faithful Man" films shared the victory in the nomination "Best Screen".
The jury's special prize was given to the Filipino crime drama "Alpha: the right to murder."
Vertigo, tears and laughter
The festival in San Sebastian is called one of the main cultural events in Spain and one of the most important European film competitions.
Director Isaki Lacuesta, the owner of the "Golden shell", told about his impressions of the festival Euronews:
It was wonderful!
We came here with the whole team and of course we experienced dizzying moments, tears, and laughter.
We are happy.
We started making this film 14 years ago, it was a very long job, and what is especially important to me is that we didn't want to stop.
Now is the time for joy and gratitude.
As noted by the correspondent of Euronews, Carlos Marlasca, the film of Isaqui Lacuesta organically fits into the collection of paintings, which received "Golden shells", "but the festival in San Sebastian was not without unexpected, sometimes shocking decisions of the jury, which sometimes even call the visiting card of the competition."

Putin spent a weekend rest in Khakassia taiga
Russian President Vladimir Putin spent Saturday resting in the taiga of Khakassia.
This was reported to journalists by the press secretary of the Russian leader Dmitry Peskov on Sunday, September 30.
In Khakassia, Putin stopped on his way from Dushanbe, where the summit of CIS leaders was held on Friday.
"On the way from Dushanbe, Vladimir Putin made a stop in Khakassia, where he spent Saturday in the taiga with a brief rest", TASS quotes Peskov as saying.
He noted that the President went further to Sochi.
Earlier on September 30, it became known that Vladimir Putin visited the 16th stage of the championship of the Formula One race series on Sunday.
The head of Russia awarded the winner of the race of the British Lewis Hamilton, and also personally congratulated the rider during a short conversation in the waiting area.
The Grand Prix of Russia was held on the Sochi racing track "Sochi-Avtodrom" from 28 to 30 September.
In August of this year, Vladimir Putin made a two-day stop on his way to the Far East in the Republic of Tyva in Southern Siberia.
The Russian leader fished on mountain lakes, walked along rivers on motor boats and rafts, and also made crossings on mountains on quad bikes and on foot.
The president was accompanied by Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, Victor Zimin, who was head of Khakassia at the time, and the head of Tyva Sholban Kara-ol.
The head of state is not the first to visit these regions

Basta shamed "Rostov" fans
Russian musician Vasily Vakulenko, performing under the pseudonym of Bast, addressed fans of the football club "Rostov" during his concert on the local arena.
His words are reported by Rostovgazeta.ru.
Why are we so hypocritical and happy only with success?
Where were you all when the club was in a terrible situation?
Everyone remembered the great club once again, only when everything got better.
But let's also talk about other football teams in Rostov," said Basta.
The musician's concert was held on September 29.
On the same day there was evidence that the field of "Rostov-Arena" was injured because of the protective covering that was erected before the rapper's performance.
The football club "Rostov", as well as the leadership of the Russian Premier League (RPL) reacted negatively to the holding of a musical concert at the Rostov stadium.
Their concerns were connected to the fact that the lawn of the arena could suffer from similar events.
According to the results of eight rounds, the Rostov RPL occupies the fourth line of the tournament table.
The team won four victories, played in a draw three times and only lost once.

On September 30, 1928, precisely 90 years ago, the British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming announced an unprecedented discovery.
The discovery of penicillin marked the beginning of an era of modern antibiotics, brought Fleming world fame and made him the Nobel laureate.
Incidentally, the separation of penicillin from mold mushrooms was not Fleming's first discovery.
A few years earlier, when he was cold, he sowed mucus from his own nose to Petri's cup (this is a glass cap in which experiments with bacteria are being conducted) and after a few days discovered that the bacteria there were destroyed.
Almost as accidentally they were found penicillin.
Fleming's name was added to the list of the 100 most outstanding personalities in human history.
His discovery, according to many scientists, changed the course of history.
With the help of penicillin, medicine began to cope with most of the ancient diseases previously considered incurable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene...
When, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, Fleming arrived in the French capital in 1945, Parisian newspapers wrote: "To defeat fascism and the liberation of France, he did more than dozens of divisions."
According to experts, Fleming's discovery of the world's first antibiotic saved the lives of more than 200 million people on earth.
Alexander Fleming died in his London home in 1955 from a heart attack.
He was cremated and a week later his ashes were buried in the famous London St. Paul's Cathedral.
Where, by the way, our spouse and I drew attention to this by a verbal Russian-speaking guide.
A few years later, we were able to observe the statue of Alexander Fleming in full height in the most unexpected place for this in the capital of Spain.
There, next to the main arena for the bullfighting of the Place de Toros de Las Ventas, the most famous Spanish matadors erected a monument to a man whose efforts saved, in their opinion, the lives of hundreds of outstanding bullfighters.
Incidentally, this, in my opinion, very interesting porcelain work was found by me there, in Madrid, but at another time and not at all in this regard.

The American leader denied the information that he dropped questions about the departure of remains of American soldiers from the DPRK and the release of prisoners.

Hollywood star Gwyneth Paltrow (Iron Man, Love Shakespeare) married producer Brad Falchuck.
Although rumours about their wedding were still going on in April, the pair only officially concluded now - September 29.
As People magazine writes, a private ceremony took place at Paltrow House on Long Island.
Three tents were installed on the territory of its property: one directly carried out the wedding, the other - treats for guests, and the third was intended for staff.
Among the guests were director Stephen Spielberg (Guinet godfather), film stars Cameron Diaz, Robert Downey Jr., Leew Tyler and others.
Paltrou, who turned 46 on September 27, met 47-year-old Brad for three years before announcing an engagement with him in January of this year.
She calls him "a man who was destined to her fate."
The actress previously married British musician Chris Martin, leader of Coldplay.
In this marriage, she had two children: the daughters of Apple are now 14 and the son of Moses 12.
In 2015, the pair filed for a divorce.
Gwyneth and Chris did not celebrate in 2003.
Therefore, the film star considers his wedding with Felchak to be the first.
Brad has been married to television producer Susanna Bukinik for ten years.
From this marriage he also has two children.

Google will pay Apple $9 billion for the default search engine status
U.S.-based Google will pay $9 billion to remain the default search engine in Apple's Safari browser.
According to the publication of Business Insider, next year payments will rise to $12 billion.
Last year, Google paid $3 billion for this option.
It is noted that the annual fee is calculated based on how many requests to search for Google were made from voice helper Siri and Safari browser on iOS devices.
According to analysts, Google is disadvantageous to abandon the search engine status by default, since Apple is one of the largest sources of traffic for the search engine.
In early August, Apple became the first American company with a $1 trillion capitalization.
From the previously published reports it follows that the corporation's net profit in the third quarter increased by 32% compared to the same period in 2017, reaching $11.5 billion.

In these cases, it remains a means No. 1.

Trump spoke about "love" at Kim Jong-un
US and DPRK leaders are almost in love with each other, Donald Trump joked.
US President Donald Trump noted a successful joke about his successes on the front of resolving the North Korean crisis.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, now the leaders of the two countries have adjusted relations so much that they are almost in love with each other, noted the American President.
The White House host recalled that he accepted the North Korean problem from the previous administration as the main difficulty in foreign policy.
Trump noted that Barack Obama's team has launched relations with the DPRK so much that it couldn't even reach the country's leadership - they simply didn't take the phone off there.
Back then, the US and North Korea were on the brink of war, and today the North Korean leader writes to the White House "beautiful letters," Trump noted.
Trump admitted that at the start of his work, too, he "was cruel" to Kim Jong-un, which, however, was mutual.
Now, however, their relationship has grown so high that leaders "have fallen in love with each other."
Moreover, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the American media would interpret them as incompetence.
Trump has pointed out that Pyongyang has lately halted nuclear and missile tests and is closing military training grounds.
All this is the merits of his administration, the American President is certain.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump flattered on Kim Jong-un from the UN General Assembly platform.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for the courage and the steps taken to de-escalate tensions.
Moreover, Trump noted that sanctions against the DPRK will continue until full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
Negotiations in Singapore
On June 12, the first ever talks between US and North Korean leaders took place in Singapore.
After a serious deterioration of relations and mutual threats to use nuclear weapons, the summit looked like a turning point in the protracted US-Korean crisis.
Following the negotiations, the parties expressed their intention to move towards peaceful resolution of disputes, although they did not assume any legal obligations.
The positive results of the meeting were the cessation of nuclear and missile tests of the DPRK, as well as the return of the remains of American soldiers in the country to the United States.
At the same time, other practical steps towards denuclearization of North Korea are still underway.
The media reported that after the Singapore summit, the United States has already sent several disarmament scenarios to the DPRK, but Pyongyang rejected them, calling them "gangster."

Nice called for ousting "Moscow language with Ukrainian product"
The Ukrainian children's writer and fighter for the purity of her native language, Larisa Nitza, called for ousting "Russian-speaking Moscow product and Moscow language" from Ukraine.
It proposes to do this with the Ukrainian product - "cultural wave, cultural onslaught".
Nita shared her thoughts on "the expediency of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine" with the Ukrainian publication, Observer.
According to her, the corresponding Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it even exists and continues to develop further.
Over time, Ukrainians will "heal" from this "Moscow language," she is convinced.
For example, in neighbouring Poland, she said, Russian speech had previously been widely used on television and radio, but there was little left in the public space.
Moreover, according to Nica, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, are only "an expansion of the boundaries for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level."
Previously, Nice shared her experience of maintaining a "Ukrainian-speaking regime" in a children's camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the Watsons chain of bookstores by the court, one of which contacted her in Russian.
Having failed to achieve her, Nice threw her back into the girl.
She calls the use of Russian words Ukrainians "a language schizophrenia," urging Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in the writing of names.
Recently, Nice declared that the name "Rus" was stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
The writer's anger could not be avoided even by the Security Service of Ukraine: after coming there and hearing the conversations of employees with each other in Russian, she committed a scandal and left, slamming the door.

Men's conversations were held during the break and it bore fruit
Defender of "Ural" Denis Kulakov - about victory over "Arsenal" (2:1) in the match of the ninth round of the Russian championship.
"Deniz, why, in your opinion, managed to win?"
"I think we wanted to win more," Kulakov's official website quotes the Urals as saying.
"Such a difficult game turned out to be, they had a serious men's conversation during the break, and it brought fruit: they scored two goals and didn't miss them.
"You missed several matches because of the damage you received at the beginning of the month.
How did you feel today?"
"If I endured 90 minutes, then everything is fine!
In fact, I felt good.
Maybe, in the end, a little bit of a bank of strength, so that nothing happens.
And so, doctors and physiotherapists Vladimir A. Hashnev led me to this game, for which they are very grateful!
"What will you say about the atmosphere on the team?"
"It's no secret that after victories it's easier to recover and the mood in the team is good.
Now we have a white band, although at first it was black.
We must continue in the same spirit and please fans."
"I was bored with the game during the time I wasn't on the pitch?"
"There is such a thing, I'm a little bored because, indeed, the unpleasant situation came out.
But once again, thanks to the physiotherapist and doctors that they put on their feet.
Most importantly, we won and pleased the fans.
And the rest is secondary."

Violations registered in referendum in Macedonia
Four incidents related to violations of electoral legislation were registered in the Republic of Macedonia in a referendum on the intergovernmental agreement with Greece on renaming.
A spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior, Tony Angelovsky, reported this Sunday.
Since the opening of polling stations, 4 incidents have been recorded that have been eliminated, he said.
At the polling station at the Lazo Angelowski elementary school in Skopje, 22-year-old K.Z. violated public order and calmness, insulted citizens and attacked police officers.
He was detained and taken to the police station.
According to a representative of the MFA, all offenders were immediately taken to police stations.
The Ministry noted that all violations are checked.
"The Ministry will act in accordance with the law so that citizens can safely exercise the constitutional right to freely express their will.
We call on citizens to comply with laws and refrain from any violations of public order and calmness and any violation of the secrecy of voting‚Äù, the representative of the Ministry of the Interior said.
During the referendum on Sunday, citizens are asked to answer one question: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?"
A referendum is called to resolve the 27-year dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav Republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek region.
The heads of the MFA of Macedonia and Greece signed an agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic during a solemn ceremony on the shore of Lake Prespa, which runs the border between the two countries.
It provides for the use of the name "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The treaty should resolve not only a longstanding dispute about the country's name, but also open Skopje's path to NATO and the EU.

Syrian Foreign Minister: Russia's decision to deliver S-300 is a timely step
Russia's decision to deliver S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems (ABMs) to Syria is a timely step.
This opinion was expressed by the head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Walid Moallem, in an interview with the television channel RT, aired on Sunday.
If we analyze the importance of protecting the Syrian sky, we will see that it is a sign of security and stability, not war.
I want to say that this is a very timely step, and we are very grateful in this regard to Russia for its efforts‚Äù, the minister noted.
The head of the Syrian MFA also stressed that the S-300 is a defensive system, not an offensive system, and it is intended to protect the Syrian sky.
Pashinyan hopes to hold early parliamentary elections in Armenia in 2018
The elections to the Armenian parliament may take place as early as 2018, stated the country‚Äôs Prime Minister, Nikolai Pashinyan.
"It is not excluded, until the end of the year," the head of government answered the question of journalists about the timing of their holding (quote on Interfax).
Mr Pashinyan also did not rule out that he would once again take people to the streets to hold early elections if the discussion of this issue with parliamentary forces did not succeed.
But I am determined to hold negotiations with parliamentary forces.
I hope that they are also committed to constructive dialogue‚Äù, the prime minister of Novosti-Armenia quotes.
Nikol Pashinyan added that early elections are a "requirement of the people" as well as a part of the government program, for which the parliament voted.
"The long-term vision of the government," according to him, is also necessary to attract investment and develop the economy.
At the UN General Assembly in New York, Mr Pashinyan promised after returning to Yerevan to start "negotiations with representatives of all parliamentary as well as extra-parliamentary forces to discuss the time and conditions for early elections."
In the current parliament, about half of the deputies represent the Republican Party of Armenia (RPA) opposition to Mr Pashinyan.
Early voting is impossible without the dissolution of parliament, and there is no legal basis for this.

The charge against the Dagestani MP became news
The Soviet district court of Makhachkala detained Rajab Abdulatipov, a deputy of the People's Assembly of Dagestan, suspected of involvement in the criminal community, who registered a disability for bribes.
Kommersant learned details of investigative materials that shed light on how, according to the Investigative Committee of Russia, Rajab Abdulatipov, the younger brother of former head of the republic, Ramazan Abdulatipov, contributed to the criminal actions of the now former head of the Main Office of Medical and Social Expertise, Magomed Makhachev, and his accomplices.
Among other things, during the search activities conducted by employees of the Ministry of the Interior, it was established that Rajab Abdulatipov lobbied for the appointment of Magomed Makhachev as head of the bureau, allegedly receiving 70 million roubles for this.
To recap, earlier, a criminal case was opened against Magomed Makhachev, other heads and employees of the territorial bureaus of medical and social expertise under his control, under Article 210 (creation of a criminal community using a official position and participation in it), Article 290 (receiving bribes by an organized group), Article 292 (forgery of service), and Article 159 (fraud in a particularly large amount) of the Criminal Code.
According to investigation materials, at the end of 2013, Rajab Abdulatipov, aware of the illegal actions of Magomed Makhachev and his accomplices involved in the embezzlement of funds from the Pension Fund, joined their activities by joining the criminal community.
While serving as head of the Department of the Federal Migration Service of Russia for Dagestan and having links with government authorities and law enforcement agencies, as well as taking advantage of his kinship with the head of Dagestan, Rajab Abdulatipov, investigators believe, "has ensured the activity of other members of the criminal community, established contacts with officials of government agencies to support the illegal activities of Magomed Makhachev and his being in the position of Head of the Federal Expertise Office for the Republic of the Ministry of Medicos, Daco.
After the announcement of this information at a meeting of the Soviet District Court on Friday, Rajab Abdulatipov rejected the charges against him.
"Of course, all that is presented to me today as a charge is new for me, absolutely I don't know about it," he said.
The court arrested a deputy from United Russia not for ten days before the indictment, as it was with previous high-ranking Dagestani officials, but immediately for two months, since in his case there is Article 210 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, the investigators have much more time to indict them - up to 45 days since their arrest.

Yevkurov responded to oil claims of "fantasers"
The Ingush village of Dattykh, where oil is supposed to be produced, will not be transferred to Chechnya.
The head of Ingushetia, Yunus-Bek Yevkurov, described information on this as fantasy, as there are 19 canned wells with a high sulphur content that prevents the production of oil near the Dattykh field.
It is necessary to invest 100 roubles to earn one rouble, Yevkurov added.
Of the 19 mentioned wells, 16 are located within the territory of Ingushetia and are on the balance sheet of OAO RN Ingneft, Interfax reports.
On September 26, Yevkurov and the head of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, signed an agreement to consolidate the administrative border between the regions, which clearly defines the boundaries for the first time since 1991.

Serbian President wants to ask Putin for support
The President of Serbia, Alexander Vuchic, will discuss the situation with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, and ask for his support during a meeting in Moscow.
Serbian President Alexander Vuchic will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.
During the meeting, he plans to discuss the current situation with a colleague from the Russian Federation.
Moreover, Vucic intends to ask Putin for support.
The Serbian leader made the corresponding statement during a press conference, reports the local newspaper, Vecherniye Novosti.
According to the source, the head of Serbia specified that, speaking of the need for support from the Russian side, he does not mean military support following the example of Syria.
Alexander Vuchic stated that he does not want to allow a scenario in which major military clashes could occur within the territory of the state.
The President of the country promised to make every effort to preserve peace, the publication reports.
We add that according to the Serbian media, the meeting of the heads of Russia and Serbia is scheduled for the upcoming Tuesday, October 2, writes Lenta.ru.
A day earlier, it became known that the Serbian President brought the state army to full combat readiness due to the situation with Kosovo.
This is about the events of last Friday, when several dozen special forces of Kosovo entered the territory that is adjacent to the lake that supplies water to the Gazivode hydroelectric power plant.
This HPP is located in the territory of Kosovo, but also belongs to the Serbian energy system.
Let us recall that Kosovo declared independence from Serbia a decade ago, however, in Belgrade this fact was refused recognition.

Kosachev: Russia was virtually absent from the 73rd Session of the UN General Assembly in a negative way
The Head of the Committee of the Federation Council on Foreign Affairs Konstantin Kosachev considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly successful for Russia and does not rule out that it will be able to become a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an inalienable participant in solving global global problems.
"The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric we have almost become accustomed to in recent years with respect to Russia has now been much more muted," the senator said in an interview published Sunday by Rossiyskaya Gazeta.
He explained that in previous years, the Russian Federation was sometimes "designated as one of the three main threats to humanity, then alongside Ebola, then alongside climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this row, in any case, in a statement by a group of Western countries, which expressed itself fairly unanimously on this issue."
At the 73rd Session, Kosachev stressed, "the topic of Russia in a negative way was almost absent."
"If you carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Germany, I now do not take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, the choir was not absolutely accurate," noted the politician, noting that Russia "was no longer a certain wall, about which tennis balls train."
The head of the relevant committee of the Council of Federation does not rule out that this is evidence of a certain trend, which, in his opinion, "will highlight the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although, in full measure, this trend may manifest itself in a year, in two or three."
"I don't rule out that the current session, in some sense, could be a turning point," admitted Kosachev, explaining that "too many examples of how to move forward with connecting Russia in international affairs."
As an example, he cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"Unfortunately, this is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time," the parliamentarian added.
This is due to the fact, he believes, that there is an "adequate, sound perception of Russia as not just possible - an inalienable participant in solving global problems of modernity."
"I don't want to be wrong, but I have the feeling that we are somewhere passing a point beyond which movement will no longer be a reversal, it will be a movement forward," he added.
Kosachev called another "interesting and important feeling" in this context "a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop."
"I attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov, and I held my own meetings, and I saw with great pleasure that if another year or two or five years ago, the Russian opinion, the Russian vision of what is happening in the world, by and large, no one was interested, then now the situation is different," stated the chairman of the committee of the Council of Federation.
According to him, this is due to the fact that "the so-called new liberal order, which is personified with the West, has no answers to questions about how to solve world problems due to an obvious shortage of ideas in the global space, a shortage of ideas on how to solve the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the problems of migration."
"And here the request for a Russian vision is becoming increasingly obvious," Kosachev expressed confidence, stressing that in this sense he considers that "the current session is successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia."

Damascus declares its right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that the Syrian province of Idlib will not have to use military force, said the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Syrian Arab Republic, Walid Moallem.
Moreover, according to him, Syria has the right to do this.
The minister added that Turkey has an opportunity to quickly solve the problem of withdrawing militants from the demilitarized zone in Idlib banned in Russia organization Jebhat al-Nusra, reports RIA Novosti.
The Foreign Minister also stressed that Damascus will have to resort to a military solution to the problem of territories east of the Euphrates in case the Kurds seek separatism.
At the same time, according to Muallem, negotiations with the Kurdish SDF forces were good until they interrupted due to the USA.
On September 17, Putin and Turkish President Recep Erdogan agreed to create a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between the armed opposition and government troops in the Syrian province of Idlib by October 15.

Earlier, it was reported that the 37-year-old defender conducted negotiations on the transition to Moscow's Spartak.
RT reports citing Mirror that former captain of England, John Terry, heads the Chelsea youth team.
According to a source, a well-known player who has been a part of the London club for a long time will manage the team not older than 23 years.
It is noted that in the coaching staff Terry will replace Jody Morris, who left for "Derby County".
To recall, in September Terry was close to switching to Moscow's Spartak, but eventually abandoned the idea after talking to his family.

The First Vice Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada, Irina Gerashchenko, apologized to the convicted in the Russian Federation for "spying" by Ukrainian journalist Roman Sushchenko for failing to release him from prison.
She said this in a video address to the political prisoner recorded on the eve of the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of Sushchenko by the FSB.
According to her, these days, an action is taking place under the walls of the Russian embassy in Paris, the participants of which announced a hungry protest demanding the release of prisoners of the Kremlin.
Every day French journalists, politicians, cultural figures, among whom there are people who know you well, starve to support Oleg Sentsov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and, of course, you.
There is no international meeting, no negotiations, no interview where the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities, all of us, did not demand pressure on the Kremlin, exert pressure on Putin with one demand: the liberation of Oleg, the liberation of Roman, the liberation of all political prisoners of the Kremlin and those children who are illegally detained in the occupied territories of Donbass and Crimea‚Äù, Gerashchenko said.
She also expressed confidence that the tests will harden every Ukrainian, making us "eviler, tougher in protecting the national interests of Ukraine, in protecting every Ukrainian, in understanding what is good and what is evil."
To recap, Ukrinform correspondent in France Roman Sushchenko was detained by Russian security forces on September 30, 2016 at the Moscow airport.
On October 7, he was charged with spying on the Main Directorate of the Defence Intelligence of Ukraine.
On June 4, 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sushchenko to 12 years in a high security penal colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia recognised the verdict as legal.
Russian jailers granted the last request of a Ukrainian before his imprisonment.

NASA reported a Big Ben-sized asteroid approaching Earth
The American space agency NASA reported that a large asteroid SP1, whose length can reach 160 m, is approaching the Earth.
According to the Daily Express, the length of the space object could exceed the height of the famous Big Ben or London Ferris wheel.
Moreover, there is no exact data on its size.
The speed with which SP1 moves is about 60 thousand km/h. The lowest distance between the asteroid and the Earth will be on October 3.
Then it will fly past our planet at a distance of 0,03926 astronomical units, or 5.87 million km.
The asteroid was first spotted on September 19.
NASA listed him as near-earth objects.

Defamation of football lawn of 2018 World Cup stadium ascribed to Baste
The damage to the football lawn at the stadium in Rostov-on-Don was associated with the concert of Russian rapper Vasily Vakulenko, or Basta.
The photo was published in the Instagram account hd7tv.
"We're very good at Bast and his work, but... sorry for the lawn," the caption says.
The comments claim that grass near the edge of the field was injured due to the protective covering (special tiles).
The concert, scheduled for September 29, was never cancelled.
The football club "Rostov", as well as the Russian Premier League, opposed the holding of the concert.
"I want to know the names of those footballers and representatives of "Rostov" who claim that my performance can damage, hinder the activity and development of the football club, as well as affect the performance of its players," wrote Basta in response to criticism.

Vakhtang Kikabidze about cancer control
Now, many artists talk about how they managed to cope with oncology.
The disease, unfortunately, does not spare anyone, and the stories of popular people about the victory over cancer gives hope to many patients.

In addition, the head of the MFA of the neighbouring countries was found out in "direct threats of invasion of Ukraine" and "support of separatist sentiments in Ukraine," as well as in participation "in the organization of a provocation aimed at a massive violation of Ukrainian legislation by citizens."
It bears mentioning that in front of Szijjarto, Deputy of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra Pavel and Primate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) Onufrius were pleased with the "Church."
The reason was their opposition to receiving Tomos by the Ukrainian local church.

Authorities named the sum of the "golden parachute" of the Voronezh deputy governor
The one-time payment of 23 salaries to the deputy governor of Voronezh region, Yuri Agibalov, was made based on the regional law "On State Posts".
Moreover, the actual amount of the "golden parachute" released from office by an official was several times less than the amount announced in the media.
Such explanations were provided by the press service of the regional government.
According to the law, the salary for the post held by Agibalov amounts to 11,189 roubles.
Thus, stressed in the press service, the amount of a one-time payment amounted to 223,892 roubles less income tax, not 1 million roubles, which the media wrote about.
The official has received an old-age insurance pension since July 2018.
His experience in public office is more than nine years.
The appointment of this pension and one-time payment is made immediately after dismissal from office, explained the agency "RIA Novosti" in the regional government.
Moreover, Agibalov's pension payment was suspended when assigned to state debt, and his salary remained unchanged compared to the previous period.
The victorious governor of the region, Alexander Gusev, took office on September 15.
Agibalova was relieved of the post in connection with the expiration of the term of office of the head of the region.
Similarly, the powers of other officials who held public offices in the region have ended.
On September 29, Telegram-channel "Nezygar" published documents from which it follows that Agibalova, who resigned from the post of vice governor, was paid a severance allowance in the amount of 23 salaries, and two days after that, he again received a similar post without having the addition of "vario".

State Duma deputy urged to tell schoolchildren about the dangers of masturbation
Onishchenko holds the post of First Deputy Chairman of the Committee on Education and Science.
Based on his experience, he noted in an interview that teenagers are provoking harmful information they find online.
The deputy added that the fight against this is at the level of educational institutions and family.
Gennady Onishchenko, Deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with radio station "Govorit Moscow":
In terms of general sexual education of children, this needs to be done, explaining the dangers, because there is a risk to the child's sexual health, both the boy and the girl.
The problem is objective, it is that the ripening of children comes early enough, and then there are large scissors between their puberty and the ability to officially enter intersex contacts.
According to Onishchenko, the solution to the problem is hampered by "sovereignty," the silence of "sexual problems" and the absence of a culture of adequate upbringing of children.
The doctor is confident that many teenagers are faced with onanism.
The MP believes that practising lessons about the dangers of Onanism is primarily at schools of "hyperurbanised" regions.

The AfD became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany is breaking yet another record, while Angela Merkel's ratings are falling.
Apparently, Germans began to get tired of Angela Merkel's immigration policy, thanks to which the country became a coveted target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
The latest polls show that the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party is becoming increasingly popular and the position of the ruling bloc, Merkel and Seehofer, is weakening.
This week the AfD broke another record by climbing to second place in the popular sympathy rating.
Right-wing conservatives, with 17 per cent of their popularity, managed to bypass social democrats, who have around 16%.
The one-percentage gap can be written down as a statistical error, but it should be noted that the AfD, created in 2013, from a small group of Eurosceptic economists, has managed to turn into a serious political force.
Leadership in the overall standings has so far been retained by the ruling bloc CSU/CDU, which has about 30 percent.
However, there is a trend towards losing points - back in April, support for the Angela Merkel bloc was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48 percent of Germans support Angela Merkel, which is 7 percent lower than last year.
Let us add that the "green" (15%), the left (11%) and the liberals (10%) follow the social democrats.
The evolution of Alternatives
The Alternative for Germany party was created in September 2012 based on the Alternative Choice 2013 group, which included members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially came into opposition to the government course, but in the beginning it only dealt with economic issues, including problems of the euro and interaction within the EU.
Moreover, the group opposed "sponsoring" Germany's weak EU economies, did not rule out the possibility of a return to the German brand and a complete withdrawal of the country from the EU.
Amid the deepening immigration crisis, the AfD's political platform has expanded.
In 2013, the group entered into a full-fledged party, which occupied the niche of Eurosceptics and began to harshly criticise the government for the failure of immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the AfD managed to break through to the Bundestag for the first time, receiving 94 deputy seats (out of 709).
Two "Alternative for Germany" representatives get a seat in the European Parliament.
A video with a journalist calling the citizens of Ukraine a "nation of dice" was posted
The leader of the political talk show on Ukrainian TV, the author of two books, Ostap Drozdov, admitted live that he considers his compatriots a "nation of dice."
They believe TV and read little.
Drozdov noted that it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
"From childhood, we have no culture of reading and accepting texts," the journalist said.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting Nezalezhnaya began to fight against literature, which has the slightest hint of criticism of the Kiev authorities, prohibiting the import of as many as 201 editions.

Canadians created a car in case of an apocalypse - magazine Behind the wheel
Anyone can buy this car.
Roshel Defence Solutions said it has already accepted requests for its new armoured vehicle.
The Apocalypse armored vehicle Roshel Senator APC
On the subject of the apocalypse, money is not only made by video game producers, film studios, and book publishers.
Now automobile companies are also developing a new niche for themselves.
For example, Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions presented its armoured vehicle, the APC Senator.
In a fantasy-free time, the company's engineers create armored vehicles for the police.
Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers who are placed in an all-welded armoured vehicle without special comfort but in complete safety.
This bunker, or else the design can't be called, since its booking level meets the B7 standard, is installed on the chassis of the powerful Ford Super Duty pickup truck.
Its bottom, also armoured, is capable of protecting the capsule from explosions with grenades and antipersonnel mines.
Roshel Senator APC armoured vehicle salon
In order that even the explosive wave from the shell exploding near the car does not hurt passengers, the vehicle cabin is equipped with special shock absorbing chairs.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and firefighting system.
For safe viewing, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a system of surveillance cameras with night vision function, as well as a viewing armoured rooftop tower.
There are no weapons in the vehicle.
Front of Roshel Senator APC armoured vehicle cabin
In order to ensure that the weight of the armored vehicle does not depend on its mobility, Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 6.7-litre 330-strong, hard-powered turbodiesel engine, whose full power is transferred to the four wheels of the armored vehicle via a 6-speed automatic transmission.
There is no chance of getting stuck entirely with the Roshel Senator APC armoured vehicle
An apocalypse armored vehicle, Roshel Senator APC, will be available at a special exhibition in Washington in October.

The death date of the universe is named
The universe is still around 140 billion years old, ten times the age of the observed world of around 13.8 billion years.
The research of the international team of scientists has been published in the library of electronic preprints arXiv.org and is aimed at publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Experts came to such conclusions, observing with the help of the camera HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) telescope Subaru for about ten million galaxies.
Having traced the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 percent of the energy mass of the observed world, scientists, working within the framework of the standard cosmological model of the CDM (Cloud Dark Matter), estimated the rate of expansion of the universe, which turned out to be a little slower than previously thought.
In a press release, the Subaru Observatory noted that the observations made it possible to obtain a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, and the accounting of data from the European space telescope Planck clarified the restrictions imposed on the parameters of the CDM.
In July, scientists simulated the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier their colleagues presented new arguments that the observed world would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Great rupture.
So, even if I convince you to do something, sometimes it's hard to get some effect as a result.

Another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum has failed
The possibility of knowing the opinion of the people about the pension reform is postponed indefinitely
A meeting of the federal-wide referendum initiative group against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups that registered various formulations of questions (in total, the Central Election Commission registered five formulations).
They decided to apply to the CEC for the registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians the question: "Do you want the age established by the legislation on pension provision, as of July 1, 2018, when Russian citizens achieve the right to assign retirement pensions, not to increase?"
This formulation was registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was precisely this group that was considered the simplest and most legally significant.
The majority of participants in the meeting were supporters of A Just Russia member Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and the CPRF (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups - from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Earlier, Sviridov told Vedomosti that the invitations were sent out to all the initiators, and representatives from around 40 subgroups expressed their consent to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who heads the Vologda subgroup (her formulation was supported by another 15 subgroups), told Vedomosti that she did not receive invitations and did not plan to come: "We did not understand who is a friend and who is an enemy."

And that we won is also very important."
"Why did you decide to give Danis Zaripov a respite in this series?"
"We have our own programme on which it works.
Therefore, there was such a decision," the club's press service quotes Bilyaletdinov as saying.

Elon Musk to resign as Tesla CEO
According to the agreement, Mr. Musk will have to leave the post of chairman of the board of directors of Tesla company and pay a fine of $20 million.
Moreover, the businessman will retain the post of chief executive officer of the company, reports AFP citing the regulatory data.
Tesla will also have to pay a fine of $20m.
Previously, the regulator filed a suit against Elon Musk - officials believed that he misled investors Tesla, because the businessman allowed the buyback of all shares of the company at a high price - $420 per paper.

In "Loko" - "Ahmat" match Turbin's mistakes fell as if from the horn of plenty
Former All-Union judge Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of referee Yevgeny Turbin in the match of the 9th round of the Russian championship "Lokomotiv" - "Ahmat" and examined the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you assess the refereeing of Evgeny Turbin in the match "Lokomotiv" - "Ahmat"?
- I believe that this referee confirmed his inability to referee the matches of the Russian Premier League.
I am surprised that the pressures in the meeting of the fifth round of the "Spartak" - "Dynamo", neither Turbin himself, nor DSI leaders made serious conclusions about his low qualification.
The result was immediately reflected in the ninth round: mistakes in his actions, private skippings of crude tricks, spilled like from the horn of plenty.
For example, in the 50th minute of the trainman, Eder, with his hands in his penalty area, the defender of "Ahmat" Rodolfo.
The gate is eight metres away, but Turbin does not penalise.
- How do you assess the episode involving Idowa, who was on the 82nd minute when it seemed that the ball hit his hand?
- I believe that here was a deliberate game by the defender's hand in his penalty area.
Turbin was near the moment, seeing the episode well and his first assistant on the right.
This point was also to be seen by reserve judge Sergei Karasev.
However, all three fell asleep and the penalty was not appointed.
Therefore, the score in the match is distorted and sport fairness has been violated.
This was the case when refereeing, in terms of replacing and burying the sporting spirit of the game.
- In the 52nd minute, Turbin did not dare to remove the defender of the guests, Oleg Ivanov, who violated the rules in the fight against Krikhovyak, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, demonstratively applauded him.
What do you think about this episode?
Was it necessary to show the second "mustard"?
- At this point, Turbin and the first yellow card showed not exactly in business.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about the double standards of refereeing that some teams are penalised for such violations as in the episode with Idowa, but some do not.
What do you assess the words of a footballer?
- Looking at what to understand by double standards.
There was a penalty.
They didn't give him.
It means that the referee does not give a second penalty to the opposing goal.
Here is the principle that is used.
And the second point of double standards is that the judge watches who plays.
"Lokomotiv" played on Saturday and "Ahmat" has serious claims to Turbin's work because the team was infringed.
- The man changed the floor, became a lesbian. Minutes.
To his great joy, his team won the game.

Matt Damon Jr. Rape At SNL Start
American actor Matt Damon played the US Supreme Court nominee Bretta Cavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first release of the new season on Saturday Night Live on NBC.
During a small sketch, the actor played Cavanaugh at a Senate hearing on rape charges.
The U.S. Supreme Court nominee had previously drawn attention to his emotionality and the details of his stories during a conversation with Senator Amy Klobushar.
For example, Kavanaugh repeatedly admitted his love of beer, but stated that he had never been drunk to the point of memory.
Furthermore, in an attempt to justify himself on rape charges, Kavanaugh said he was a virgin in those years.
Damon also beat those moments.
I only did that I drank a lot and didn't think about sex at all.
I was the proudest, most drunken virgin ever seen.
Everyone knows this," said Matt Damon's judge.
Earlier, Kavanaugh was elected Supreme Judge of the United States.
But pay attention to the face and the language of the body of anyone present in this fuzzy picture, and you will feel that they are all playing.
But my advice to you is to tell them that you were bad and fled, and apologize.
Nothing, this is a football match, against Afula, we won, although the judge was a Jew.
Barbra Streisand found strange behaviour in her cloned dogs
American singer Barbra Streisand said her dead dog's clones behave completely differently from the original pet.
"They are different.
In fact, [clones] look like she, but it's impossible to clone the soul," said the 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old coconut-de-tulaire dog, named Samantha, who had to sleep due to health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that the chihuahua dog named Miracle Milly, who was called the world's smallest dog, was cloned for the 49th time.
Experts are cloning a six-year-old animal in an effort to understand why it is so miniature.
U.S. thinks about Russia's naval blockade due to oil and gas supplies
In the United States, the naval blockade of Russia could begin in order to gain an advantage in the global energy market.
American authorities are so eager to fight for success in the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to the naval blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world's main suppliers of energy sources.
U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke spoke about the possibility of naval blockade yesterday.
Contrary to world practice, the American Ministry of the Interior does not perform police functions, but civil functions, including implementing policies in the field of natural resources.
Therefore, Zinke's statement came entirely within the competence of his agency, although it was not deprived of political colour.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said US naval forces were controlling maritime routes in the Middle East and could block them if needed.
From Zinke's words it follows that the need may be related to Washington's desire to prevent Russian supplies to the global energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia still receives the lion's share of its income from the supply of oil and gas to the global market.
The desire to distribute supplies of energy resources in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motive behind the intensification of Moscow in this region, Zinke is confident.
The minister made it clear that the United States still expects to secure leadership in the global energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do this, Washington will have to crowd out Russia and Iran, and the maritime blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure along the way, Zinke believes.
- I have come to tell you that tomorrow I will leave for Moscow and will no longer return to this house, and you will have news of my decision through a lawyer to whom I will charge the divorce case.

Kalmyk director received good feedback from the festival
Our fellow countryman, Gogol Center actor Evgeny Sangadzhiev and his film "Harmony" ("Harmony") were awarded special mentions of members of the jury of the sixth debut festival "Movement", which took place in Omsk.
The festival diploma specifically states that "it is a signal for the immediate response of major industrial spectator film players."
As is well known, the film of the young Kalmyk director was presented in the program of short films "Movement. Beginning", which involved eight films.
The main prize in this competition program was given to the film "Yan is Anja on the contrary" - the director's debut of actress Yana Gladkikh.
The accent of the National Film Festival debuts "Movement" is made on a young film, but not in terms of age of directors, but in a state of spirit, desire and ability to risk.
And Evgeny Sangadzhiev, a graduate of the Elistinsky School of Arts named after P. Chonkushov and RATI-GITIS, meets all these requirements.
He is young, talented, creative and in his creative work aspires to new unusual forms of self-expression.

The evacuation took place through the Abu-ed-Duhur humanitarian corridor.
They also spoke in the centre about the tensions that remain in the de-escalation zone.
For example, a Syrian military man died as a result of shelling of the Makanis-ed-Duwayri district in the city of Aleppo.

Islanders call for more speedy sleep - Sakhalin International Airport
A campaign to immunise the population from influenza is underway in Sakhalin region.
Medical professionals in the island region urge residents to be more active and not ignore the recommendations of doctors.
This year, the vaccine should cover 219 thousand residents of the region, including at least 70 percent of all children.
To date, 49 thousand Sakhalin residents and Kuril residents have already been vaccinated.
More than 10 thousand visitors went to the South Sakhalin City Children's Polyclinic.
According to medical professionals, children of six months, transport workers, employees of educational and medical establishments and those who are more likely to get infected are more likely to be infected.
All of them can deliver a flu vaccine for free.

Supersonic passenger planes in Russia will deliver for serial production
Mass production of supersonic passenger airplanes in Russia will begin after 2030.
This was stated by Kirill Sypalo, Director General of the Zhukovsky Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute.
According to him, the scientific center is working on supersound issues both within the framework of international consortiums and cooperation with the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
"We feel it will take us two to three years to get a technology demonstrator, as well as another 10 to 15 years to get a serial machine that allows us to carry out transport across our homeland," added Sypalo.
He specified that Russian specialists are now faced with the question of how to make the equipment economical and safe at the same time.
At the beginning of September, the designer of aviation equipment, PJSC "Tupolev", announced the completion of pre-design work on a supersonic passenger plane, according to calculations, the aircraft will be able to speed up to 1900 km/h at an altitude of 11 km.
This was reported by Deputy General Director Valery Solozobov.

Former captain Chelsea and England team John Terry - about why they visited the match of the ninth round of the Russian championship Spartak - Rostov (0:1).
"I have a club in Russia that I follow.

I can't say I am a fan because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy for Spartak and I want to apologize once again for the decision made," Chelsea fan site quotes Terry as saying.

A dear violin was handed over to the pawnbroker for a priceless
When, in the city of Somerville (Massachusetts), the pawnbroker LBC Boutique and Loan the man brought the violin, a pawnbroker offered only $50 for an old and unpresentable instrument.
But the experienced store manager, Dylan McDermitt, suspected it was an ancient and expensive tool, and asked the expert for advice.
It turned out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violinist Ferdinando Galiano and is estimated at 250 thousand dollars.
Only the links to the violin are valued at 16-18 thousand dollars.
The investigation revealed that the violin was not so long ago stolen from one of the city residents and the instrument was returned to its legal owner.
It is not yet known how the violin got to the person who gave it to the pawnbroker, but there are no previous conflicts with the law behind it.
The manager says that now all the violin brought to the pawnbroker will be asked to play on it to make sure it really belongs to the client.

In the ninth round of the RPL, we will face an exciting confrontation: Spartak will host Rostov at its stadium in Tushina, under the guidance of Valery Karpin, a man known to be no stranger to the "people's team."
The special speculativeness of this meeting is given by the fact that clubs now have an equal number of points - 15, and they share the 3rd and 4th places in the standings, lagging behind far-absorbed Zenit and being in one point from Krasnodar, which tomorrow plays with Dynamo.
The red-and-whites now have a difficult band: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the Europa League the team of Massimo Carrera suddenly flew into "Rapid", and recently lost home to "Ahmatu".
After the draw with CSKA, which ended with a fair draw, Spartak beat the Chernomorets Cup with a minimal score and not without difficulty, and it is too early to say whether Russia's most popular club has come close to recovering from the crisis.
"Rostov" could not win three matches in a row, but, on the other hand, he already knows no defeats in five matches.
Let's see if Karpin will manage to prolong his win-win series with such a crucial match.

London erupted with accusations against Moscow
Russia is trying to rewrite the results of the Cold War, said British Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson.
But England will defend its values, he stressed during a speech at the congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham.
The threat is growing, Iran and North Korea are increasingly dangerous, enemies operate in grey areas with cyber attacks and false news, the minister added.
But the largest of them is Russia, which is building up its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Moscow repeatedly denied such statements by Western politicians, TASS reports.
At the same time, British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt said that Russia would have to pay a high price if it did not adhere to international rules and use chemical weapons.
Hunt mentioned the story of the poisoning in the English city of Salisbury in March of this year, the ex-colonel of the GRU, Sergei Skripal, convicted of spying for Britain, and his daughter Yulia.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is holding a referendum on accession to the EU and NATO, provided the country's name is changed.
A referendum is called upon to resolve a 27-year dispute with neighbouring Greece over the country's name, which coincides with the name of its neighbouring Greek province.
One of the first to vote was Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a fervent supporter of renaming the republic into Northern Macedonia.
International organizations monitor the preparations for the referendum and today's voting.
The head of the observation mission of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Jan Petersen, told Euronews how the work of observers is organized:
Approximately 100 teams moved around the country to observe the entire process today, from opening polling stations to closing them, then counting the votes and compiling the minutes.
For a month, 10 of our teams worked in the country to monitor the preparations for voting, the work of the media, the implementation of the law on the financing of electoral campaigns and the organization of the referendum.
Fay Dulgeri: "About 500 foreign observers are closely watching the voting process.
Groups of observers record the details of what is happening and communicate with members of electoral commissions in order to then present them in the final report."

The interpreter compared the mentality of Russians and Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but the few differences between them do not play a big role in mutual understanding.
This was reported on International Translator Day, September 30 by professional synchronized interpreter Barbel Sachs.
She has been engaged in translations from Russian and English for more than 30 years.
"Germans like to calmly plan events, and Russians, as the proverb puts it, "long harness, but quickly go."
But I think that this does not play a significant role for mutual understanding between peoples and for the work of an interpreter‚Äù, the expert said in a commentary to RIA Novosti.
According to the interpreter, to understand that two countries cannot do without each other, "it is enough to know history."
And in the future, Saxo noted, it makes no sense for Germany to ignore Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there is no sense in trying to ignore it.

In Yekaterinburg, the Human Foundation opened a fundraiser for State Duma deputy Vera Ganzi, who complained about low wages.
The campaign can be tracked on the organisation's website.

At the time of publication, the Russians donated 1633 roubles to Vera Hanze.
Fundraising opened on September 28 after Ganzi complained about low incomes.
According to her, the average salary of the deputy is 380 thousand roubles, which leaves nothing, so it is necessary to spend funds from a credit card.
Ganza complained that parliamentarians would not be compensated for their representation costs.

In the fight for the first line, Malcolm Lee's creation, which is remarkable, is quite noticeable ahead of another newcomer of Western rolling - the Smolfoot cartoon, a curious story of getting to know a charming yeti with a representative of a human kind, in whose existence the main character never believed.
The film directors Carey Kirkpatrick and Jason Reisig's project for their start-up weekend raised $23 million, in total justifying the expectations of experts predicting a 20-25 million tape for the weekend.
As far as Smolfut's cumulative fees are concerned, they currently amount to $38.6 million (it has already debuted in 50 countries): Mexico was the most active here, adding 3.6 million to the coffers of the film.
The three strongest this time closed the children's fairy tale "The Mystery of the House with the Watches" from horror master Alay Rota, who finally proved that the director knows how to make quality films for the audience also 12+.
In its second week, screening of John Bellers' book with charming Jack Black and Kate Blanchett earned $12.5 million, bringing the total world fee to 53.8 million.
Despite the departure from the top 3, continues to surprise with the sign of "+" thriller with Blake Liveley and Anna Kendrick "Simply request": in 17 days in the American release, the picture of Paul Fig, from whom some unrealistic financial achievements were initially not expected from the word "absolutely," collected $43 million (including 6.6 million for 28-30 October), and now has an even 62.9 million in total revenue.
The last representative for the first five this week was the Monk Curse horror, which collected $5.4 million in the period under review.
The Spin-off of the Curse, based on the results of 24 days in American (and not only, of course) cinemas, has $330 million in total earnings on its own account and has recently been proudly holding the title of the most successful franchise film, which also includes two parts of the Curse itself and two tapes about the horrible Annabel doll.
Right after the horrorr Corin Hardy following the results of last weekend, there is another representative of the genre - the debutant of Hallfest, one of the main youth horrors of the year.
On his first weekend, the offspring of a well-known editor (and with a recent director) Gregory Plotkin, who previously worked on a number of large horror projects, including "Happy Death Day," for which Hallfest is very similar in places, earned $5.1 million in the United States.
Given the film's modest budget, the result is very positive.
Seven were "Frantically Rich Asians" ($4.15 million), who seem not to think of falling out of the top 10 of the American box office: the romantic comedy, which is already on the screens for the seventh week, is by the end of September the sixth in the rating of the most box office films of the genre in history with a figure of 165.7 million.
This is the exact amount the painting has currently earned in the domestic market - the total revenue of the tape is 218.8 million.
As far as the last three lucky people, who were on the top of the US levies for September 28-30, were: "The Predator", "White Guy Rick" and "The Crimson Pepper," who earned $3.7 million, 2.38 million and 1.1 million, respectively, over the past weekend.
Let's add that next weekend, in the United States, it will be entirely possible to assemble the long-awaited "Vienna" with Tom Hardy, who - one can't doubt - will easily take the lead in the American box office following the first weekend in October.
Of the other premieres of the coming week, the musical melodrama Star was born, winner of the Venice Film Festival from Bradley Cooper, and the criminal drama Your Hate.

German FM pays tribute to victims of Nazism in Italy
An action in memory of victims of the Nazi punitive operation took place in Marduchato in northern Italy, during which 770 people were killed between September and October of 1944.
Most of them are women and children.
This year, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas attended the ceremony.
He said that "with deep grief and great shame" is bowing to murder victims and their families.
Maas promised to oppose the struggle for freedom, mutual respect and friendship between Italy and Germany to nationalism.
Along with the German minister, his Italian colleague Enzo Moavero-Milanesi arrived in Marduchado.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Italy emphasizes that the heads of foreign affairs agencies for the first time together participate in the ceremony and this symbolizes the desire of both countries to preserve the memory of the crimes of the past.

Valery Belov: The Lord helped Siberia today
Head coach of "Vityaz" Valery Belov - about the defeat of "Siberia" (3:4) in the match of the regular KHL championship.
"A colleague spoke about Siberia fans, and I want to point out our fans," Belov cites the official website of Vityaz.
"I hope they will also support it, because now almost every game is a full stadium, a great atmosphere.
The Lord probably helped Siberia today in the game, because they were very blundering, especially our leaders.
In general, our leading leaders lost the micro match 0:3, so we found it difficult to pull out the match, although there were moments.
However, I will still take the blame for myself.
Because, apparently, they missed something in preparation.
Compared to the previous match, this was another team."

"It's ugly nepotism"
Viewers outraged by Agutin's choice of the "Voice" show
Viewers at Voice 60+ blame coach Leonid Agutin for "ugly nepotism and brazen fraud."
When in blind wiretaps he recognized the voice of his father Nikolai Agutin from the first notes, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not turn to the performer.
But the sonship feelings prevailed and he chose a relative to his team.
At that time, many considered it a joke, but forgave the mentor the bias at the first stage.
But the "joke" dragged on and the star's father completely unjustifiedly took the place of more worthy performers.
And now viewers are no longer ready to forgive Agutin such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the audience of the show, resented the nepotism of the ugly and frank dragging our close relatives onto the final ladder.
I have even doubted that Agutin has the strength to not drag his father to the very first place to the end," Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina argued in the program "Man from TV."
Meanwhile, for his father's sake, Leonid Agutin "merged" the great singers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a moving song about his mother, explaining that the audience still wants to see his father in the show.
But, as it turned out, this is not the case at all, viewers want objective assessment and see really talented performers in the finale, and now Agutin has discredited the show.
"I sympathise with the Golos participants from the Agutin team - they were doomed."
"Last time, Agutin showed how he loves the Pope, but today he had to show himself as a professional."
"The competition has lost its meaning."
"To remove two talented people from the project and leave in the project his dad who does not sing but whispers, how can he then call a mentor?",
"I like how the Pope sings, organize him a concert in the Kremlin for your money and see how many people will come to this concert."
This is Golos, not Steep Relatives.
"It was unprofessional by Agutin."
"Then it's necessary to offer a dad on his own show, not a show that is made for the money of Channel 1."
"It was a real chance for someone and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless pop should make me understand more than any other participant with real vocals.
Why was a Surgut worker with a magnificent voice and timbre drained and Agutin's father brought to the finale?
And then we all complain that the same faces have been on stage and from screens for decades!
Because you don't break through nepotism!"
"What did you expect?
That's Russia!
Circle blah and nepotism.
And the money in the family budget will not be unnecessary!
The theatre of absurdity continues!"
Users also recalled that in one of the seasons of the traditional "Voice" there was a son of Gradsky on blind wiretaps.
Then the metre did not come to mind to take his son to his own team.
Moreover, he said: "Let's go from here, everything is clear."
Agutin could not act as a professional.
Please when you are ready to take your step.

Canadian military allowed to wear beards to boost spirit
Canada's Defense Department issued an order that allows service personnel to wear beards.
According to CBC television, the bill contains instructions for the care of the beard.
It is noted that the military may be ordered to shave for "security reasons."
The military beard cannot be longer than 2 cm, it must also be carefully trimmed and the neck and cheekbones should be shaved.
Moreover, fleet employees were only allowed to wear a beard on land.
The innovation is expected to "raise morale in the military and attract more Canadians to the service."
The ban on wearing a beard has been in the Canadian army since the Second World War.
It was previously reported that police in France were also allowed to wear beards and even have tattoos.
At the same time, the court in Egypt supported the ruling to remove policemen wearing beards from service.

In the centre of Kiev, the robber threatened the man with a knife, forcing him to withdraw money from the ATM.
The incident occurred in the evening of September 29 on Ivan Kudri Street, reported the capital's law enforcement agencies.
According to the victim, the unknown man approached him and started a conversation, but then suddenly snatched a knife and demanded that he be given money and a mobile phone.
Since the victim had no cash, the stranger ordered the withdrawal of money from the bank card.
After the attacker received 4,000 hryvnia and a phone, he struck the victim and fled‚Äù, the statement reads.

The scientist spoke about the possible scientific program of the Russian Federation's Expedition to the Moon
The head of the Institute for Space Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Anatoliy Petrukovich, told RIA Novosti about a possible program of scientific research for Russian cosmonauts on the Moon.
According to him, now the scientific community is developing areas of such work.
"There is no consensus so far," the scientist stressed.
He noted that one option is to place a low-frequency radio telescope on the back of the Moon, which would avoid interference from the Earth.
"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to explore space radio emission sources," added Petrukovich.
He also believes that the Moon could be used for testing robotics, using local resources for construction.
In addition, it is worth involving cosmonauts in the search for primitive organic matter on the Earth's satellite, the scientist believes.
This could help determine how life appears on planets.
Earlier, the head of the corporation "Roscosmos" said that in an optimistic version of the Russian Federation, a manned flight to the Moon could take place by 2030.

An offended client rolls out a feces basket at 7-Eleven
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of Saint Petersburg (Florida), is said to have "a tooth" for the manager of the 24-hour 7-Eleven store: in May, he put him out of the store for inappropriate behaviour.
And decided to avenge his enemy in an original way.
At the middle of the second night, he went into the store and rolled the contents of the basket brought with him onto the floor and on some of the goods on the shelves.
Faecalities and urine found in the basket, which Simms "borrowed" from a nearby mobile bio toilet.
Police officers arriving at the scene arrested the "avenger."
He was jailed and released on bail of $300.
He was charged with illegal property and criminal offences, as well as prohibited from entering a store and approaching a manager.
Although Simms' crime looks ridiculous rather than serious, the sentence may be harsh enough, as he has repeatedly violated the law before: he is counted on large-scale theft, robbery, illegal possession of weapons, driving a car in a drunken state, and cruel treatment of animals.
He wanted to convince me.. to convince me, Radio Rahim, .. to turn off my "box" and the crap is that a dude he never even once said to "Please."

German politicians ignore opening of mosque over Erdogan
The Prime Minister of the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Lachette, and the Mayor-General of Cologne, Henrietta Recker, ignored the opening ceremony of the new city mosque.
Deutsche Welle writes about this.
The President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, took part in the event.
Lachette met Erdogan at Cologne airport, but refused to go to the mosque, explaining that the event could have turned into a "extremely politicised event."
Recker said he received an unofficial invitation ahead of the opening on Friday 28 September.
According to her spokesman, such a proposal should be considered belated and not serious.
Speaking on the square ahead of the mosque, Erdogan summed up his two-day visit to Germany.
The President called them successful, according to him, he managed to meet with the President of Germany Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Chancellor Angela Merkel, with whom he also discussed the fight against racism and Islamophobia.
The new mosque in Cologne has become one of the largest in Europe, capable of accommodating around 1.1 thousand believers at the same time.
Construction cost 30 million euros, financed by the Turkish side.

The SBU identified and detained the owner of the Peugeot-301 car, who drove around the capital the previous day with license plates of the so-called "DNR".
It was the former employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, who currently works as an agent of one of the insurance companies of Ukraine.
According to the SBU press centre, the detainee explained that the vehicle was wanted by Interpol since 2014 and was therefore detained in Russia and given to him as a representative of the insurance company.
When crossing the Ukrainian-Russian border, he removed fake license plates, however, when entering Kiev, he again established them.
According to him, he did this "in order to ensure that the vehicle registration numbers match the documents for the specified vehicle issued by Russian representatives of Interpol in the event of a vehicle stoppage for inspection by Ukrainian police."
"A set of measures is currently being implemented to verify the provided explanations, as well as to establish its possible involvement in terrorist activity", the SBU said.
It should be noted that in Ukraine the use of numbers issued by terrorists in the territories of Donbass seized by them is prohibited.

The president of the Tennis Federation of Russia (TRF) Shamil Tarpishchev commented on the removal of football players of Moscow's "Spartak" Denis Glushakov and Andrei Avshenko from training with the main squad after a like on the criticism of head coach of the team Massimo Carrera, reports Sport Weekend.
Carrer's actions were absolutely absurd.
To pay attention to such things is an insignificant stupidity.
I absolutely disagree with what Carrera does.
This only deepens the discord on the team.
First of all, these are poems, you can read and perceive them as you like.
I wouldn't have responded to this at Carrera's place.

Second, everyone wants to be fun.

Today, Spartak does not have a game, so this situation did not have to be fanned at all.
Maybe it was worth laughing at it together.
"Spartak" has a lot not in order in different lines, there is a lack of play after the introduction of young people.
Relations within the team, apparently, do not add optimism before this match‚Äù, Tarpishchev is sure.

Sirius pupils discuss natural technologies with scientists
Pupils from the Sirius Educational Centre in Sochi, participants of the School of Plant Agrobiology and Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists from the Kurchatov Institute National Research Centre.
The statement of researchers took place within the framework of the program of the Global International Forum of Convergent and Natural Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of the President of Russia Vladimir Putin, reported on the website of the educational center on September 29.
The lecture was opened by the documentary "Kody Kurchatov", during which the president of the Kurchatov Institute, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Mikhail Kovalchuk spoke about global challenges as the driving force of the development of civilization.
The scientist's lecture was published on the Sirius website.
Students learned that modern technology needs huge amounts of energy.
The alternative energy industry is not yet able to develop such volumes.
According to the organizers of the forum, natural technologies that young scientists are working on will help solve this problem.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the issue of responsibility for the development of natural technologies, and also spoke about the risks that inevitably arise when creating such technologies.
"The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, a tremendous benefit.
This is the explosive growth of medical technology, it is improving the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there is a second side.
The development of natural technologies is actually a technological reproduction of living systems.
There is a downside - targeted intervention in human activity.
There are always risks.
A car appeared - people began to die under wheels.
But vehicles are still used.
The dual nature of technology immediately.

After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, schoolchildren were able to ask questions to the participants of the meeting.
The speakers were candidate of physics and mathematics sciences, head of the Kurchatov complex of NBISS-nature-like technologies of the Kurchatov Institute Research Centre Yulia Diakova and head of the Kurchatov complex of NBISS technologies Vyacheslav Demin.
The Sirius Education Centre in Sochi was created by the Talent and Success Education Foundation on the basis of Olympic infrastructure on the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The aim of the educational centre is early detection, development and further professional support of gifted children.
Earlier in September, it was reported that winners of the All-Russian Online Olympiad on Information Security, Cybervizov, would be sent to study at Sirius.

Macedonia: No referendum due to low turnout
The referendum was called on to approve an agreement between the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country into Northern Macedonia.
Greece objected to the Macedonian using the name of its historical province.
The renaming promised the former Yugoslav Republic to open a path to NATO and later to the EU.
But, as the agency EFE reports, only 34% of turnout on Sunday's plebiscite "did not reach" the constitutional threshold of 50%.
However, since the referendum was only advisory, perhaps Skopje authorities will not refuse to rename.
Speaking shortly after closing polling stations, Macedonia's prime minister, Zoran Zaev, an advocate of a change in the name of the republic, said that if there were more votes cast, then Macedonia would change its name, regardless of the quorum it had not achieved.

Kemerovchan outraged herd of rams in cemetery
On September 30, an eyewitness reported on a well-known Kemerovo social network that one of the local cemeteries is freely strolling around its horny animals.
The animals walked between the fencing and the grass.
Commentators expressed different opinions: one of the local residents noted that in the presence of small cattle in the cemetery there is no harm, and their appetite could even help in clearing the territory of weeds and grass, but some of the city residents did not like the behaviour of animals:
"It's graves, not pastures.
There is nothing for rams to do there.
Of course, you won‚Äôt say that they blaspheme, but it‚Äôs still not a thing to do about the rams‚Äù, the outraged Kemerovochanka noted in her message.
One way or another, some eyewitnesses noted that the problem in the form of animals in the middle of the cemetery is already known, and the necessary measures will soon be taken.

Pressure and pressure - how right?
There is no word of pressure.
It is the right thing to do.
The word "press" in the sense of "toughing, influencing, influencing" only exists phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "sufficiency."
We use this word, believing that it comes from the word "pressure."
But "pressure" and "suppression" are etymologically not only not close, but even in some sense opposite.
Check it yourself.
Debt (church-book, outdated) means "satisfied, full, sufficient, sufficient for anyone or something to satisfy."
To be content, pleasure - related words.
Previously, he still had the meaning of "not being dependent on anything, being self-sufficient" - "sufficiently."
Staroslavl "debate" is related to the words "lead" and "will."
Press, suppress - entirely different.
These words are truly frightening "relatives": daos are "wolf" (squeezing the sheep), deyja are "died" and dvaid's "humiliate."
A similar phonetic image of the words "pressure" and "dumb," as well as the imminent obsoleteness of the latter, forced them to enter into contamination.
This is how we came up with this very "d [a]left," which is also used in the letter through "a," which, in a good way, is wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of the appearance and development of these words.
So, it's the right thing to do.
But this word is outdated, in its correct meaning it is no longer used.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people have a negative impact on you from above, use the word "press".
You can also use the "pressure" design, but remember it's a bureaucrat.

Our car is noticeably slower than Mercedes
Ferrari pilot Kimi Raikkonen - about the qualification of the Russian Grand Prix, according to which he took fourth place.
"Kimi, today you had a chance to compete for pole?

But the behaviour of our car has been better since the start of the weekend."
"In the course of the qualifying process, you were not inferior to Sebastian Vettel at speed, but in the end the lag was still noticeable.
What's the reason?"
"My attempt was not bad, but then there was one of the Mercedes drivers ahead.

However, it is unlikely that this affected the result significantly."
"It's very difficult to overtake in Sochi, will the start of the race be a key moment?"
"Perhaps yes, but you never know how things will work out.
It will not be easy in any case, because our car is noticeably slower than Mercedes."

Miracles still happen in our lives!
German journalist Christie Ditz spoke about one of them on Twitter.
She wrote on her page that her four-year-old had parked his runner (a child's bike without pedals) around the same lamppost all year round.
And one morning there was a nice sticker on the post with a photo of a green bike and an inscription: "Only for him."
There was no limit to the delights of mum and kid.
Christie thanked the anomalous benevolent and praised him for an interesting and fresh idea.
Her tweet quickly spread across the social network and made many people smile.
The comments to him were also remarkable:
"How wonderful it is!"
"Thank you for great communication in this world."
"I think there are a lot of people in the world who are capable of doing this."
"Unfortunately, they don't attract as much attention as the scoundrels."
"This is the world we need!"
Readers asked the journalist if suddenly she could find out who was the author of the idea, tell about it.
After all, this man appears to be somewhere nearby: he repeatedly watched how the kid is parked, once it came to his mind.

Earthquake and tsunami in Sulawesi: death toll rise
The death toll from the earthquake and the tsunami it caused on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi exceeded 400.
As the Indonesian authorities emphasize, the data on the victims is only from the city of Palo.
Rescuers are still unable to reach the Dungala region, where no less than 300 thousand people live and where the epicenter of underground tremors was located.
Vice President Yusuf Kalla did not rule out that the death toll could reach several thousand.
The magnitude of the earthquake was 7.7, but the most lethal was the tsunami caused by it.
Sutopo Purvo Nugrojo, Ministry of Emergency Situations of Indonesia: "According to our data, the height of the waves of the tsunami reached 6 meters.
We received phone information that people climbed trees up to 6 metres high.

Vucic has maintained the highest combat readiness level of the Serbian army
The President of Serbia, Aleksandr Vucic, ordered to maintain the highest level of combat readiness in which the country's armed forces were brought because of the situation in the north of the autonomous region of Kosovo and Metohija.
"The President ordered to maintain the highest level of combat readiness, its cancellation will be a separate order," said Serbian Defense Minister Alexander Vulin, whose words are quoted by TASS.
According to him, the head of state is deeply concerned about the events in Kosovo.
At the same time, Vulin boasted, the President of the Republic expressed "the pleasure of energy, labor, readiness and speed of Serbian military."
Vucic himself announced yesterday that he intends to discuss the situation in Kosovo and Metohija with Russian President Vladimir Putin and ask the Russian leader for support.
According to available data, the meeting is scheduled for October 2 and is due to take place in Moscow.
At the same time, the Serbian leader stressed that he would do everything to preserve peace, and noted that he would like his country to be a peaceful, successful economic country of the future.
Last Saturday, September 29, in spite of an international treaty ban, several dozen Kosovar special forces entered the territory of the Serbian-populated north of Kosovo and Metohija, occupying positions around the Gazivode reservoir, taking control of the Gazivode hydroelectric power plant and invading the Centre for Ecology and Development in the village of Zubin-Tok.
This was done in connection with the visit of President of Kosovo Hashim Thachi to the north.
After some time, the Kosovo special forces left the occupied positions.
It was after this that the President of Serbia brought the country's armed forces and special forces to full combat readiness, and also protested to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.

14 thousand people demonstrate against racism in Germany
About 14 thousand people demonstrated against racism in the German city of Hamburg.
The action was supported by more than 450 organizations, which came out under the slogan "Together against racism."
Organizers initially reported that about 30 thousand demonstrators will take part in the action, which will call on the authorities to refuse the deportation of migrants from the country and will defend the right of people to protect and obtain asylum, writes the newspaper Zeit.
Participants of the event also stated that the rescue of migrants in the Mediterranean Sea should cease to be considered an offense.
Furthermore, the demonstrators demanded the resignation of the head of the German Ministry of the Interior, Horst Seehofer, and the dissolution of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
One of the participants of the action, Nevroz Duman, stated that the aim of the demonstration is to show the unity of society and solidarity in this issue.

through an operation in Syria, Russia shielded itself from terrorists
During the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, around 100,000 terrorists were killed, of which 85,000 were killed by the Russian Air and Space Forces.
This was reported in connection with the third anniversary of the start of the Russian military operation in Syria by the former Chief of the Armed Forces, Head of the Federation Council Committee on Defense and Security Viktor Bondaryev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of means of destruction from the air: Air and space forces inflicted and continue to strike precisely at terrorist facilities.
According to Bondaryev, tens of thousands of terrorist facilities have been destroyed in Syria in three years: for example, the issue concerns ammunition warehouses, fortifications and headquarters.
With the help of Russian airstrikes, the defence of jihadists was hacked - this became a decisive contribution to the advance of Syrian government troops, Interfax reports.
Moreover, according to Bondaryev, the operation of our military in Syria also allowed protecting Russia from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two-thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was controlled by terrorist groups, including Islamic State (IS, banned in Russia) and Jebhat al-Nusra (prohibited in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, about four thousand militants from among Russian citizens and about five thousand citizens of post-Soviet countries fought on the IS side, reports TASS.
And this is only about registered persons, excluding those who were not identified, emphasized Bondaryev.
Most of them were trained and ready at any moment to take up arms, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter the territory of our country.
Thus, noted Bondaryev, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism at long distances - otherwise, this evil "would have come to us."

The telephones of Boris Johnson and a number of British ministers have been made public
The personal data of a number of former and current UK ministers have been made public due to a failure in the security system of an application created by the Conservative party, Sky News reports.
Specifically, the numbers of the Minister of Finance, Philip Hammond, and the former head of the British MFA, Boris Johnson, were available.
According to the television channel, several politicians received "unpleasant calls."
The technical problem has been fixed, now the use of the application is safe.

Syria accused the United States of supporting terrorism
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem accused the United States and its partners of war crimes in Syria and support of terrorism.
[Western] the coalition has completely destroyed the Syrian city of Rakka, it has destroyed infrastructure and public services in the areas against which its actions were directed, it has committed mass murder of civilians, including children and women.
These killings under international law are war crimes," he said.
According to Muallem, the U.S. and its partners provided "direct support to terrorists," since the targets of militants and the Western coalition in Syria coincided and meant "the sowing of chaos, death and destruction on their way."
The Foreign Minister also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria is almost over, and in the country has become more secure and stable.
Moallem added that Damascus also intends to clear Syria of illegal foreign presence, and priority in the reconstruction of the country will be given to Syrian partners.
In September, the head of the Russian Centre for Reconciliation of Enmities in the Republic, Lieutenant-General Vladimir Savchenko, stated that two American F-15 planes struck the Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor with prohibited phosphorus ammunition.

The President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, believes that respecting the sovereignty of other states, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
The head of state stated this during a trip to Khar'kov region, commenting on Hungary's issuance of its passports to Transcarpathia.
In defending Ukrainian citizens, I defend the sovereignty of our state.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other states, we demand the same respect for Ukraine‚Äù, Poroshenko stressed.
According to Poroshenko, as President, he will protect Ukrainian citizens wherever they are - in the east or in the west of the country.
At the same time, the head of state supported the position of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the passport scandal with Hungary, which is the intention of sending the consul of that country from Beregovo.
"I fully share each letter that the MFA said," the President noted.
As FACTS reported, a video appeared on the network on September 19, which recorded the moment when Ukrainian citizens were issued Hungarian passports at the Hungarian Consulate in Beregovo.
Moreover, they swore the oath of allegiance to Hungary.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Pavel Klimkin noted that the Hungarian consul, who appears on video showing the distribution of Hungarian passports to Ukrainians, must leave the territory of Ukraine either by decision of Budapest itself, or will be sent by Kiev.
It also became known that the Prosecutor's Office of Transcarpathian region opened a criminal case on the issue of Hungarian passports.

Putin secretly flies to Siberia
It is known that Vladimir Putin spent the last two days in Dushanbe, where he took part in the work of the CIS Council of States, and also held a series of bilateral meetings with the presidents of neighboring countries.
Data on flights of the Russian "board 1" on the Flightradar website indicate that at around 6pm Tajik time on September 28, the IL-96-300 departed from the airport of Dushanbe and took a course to the northeast.
The plane's transponder was turned off near Lake Balkhash.
The direction of his flight suggests that the airliner could fly to Khakassia.
According to information from the Baikal24 agency, the head of the region Viktor Zimin personally met the President in Abakan on the night of September 29.
According to unofficial information, Putin arrived in the Republic to spend the weekend, but the website's sources believe that the true reason is "the problem of the second round."
Next Sunday, the second round of elections for the head of the region will take place in Khakassia.
It was joined by Valentin Konovalov (CPRF) and the current head of the republic, Viktor Zimin (United Russia).
However, on September 21, Zimin withdrew his candidacy.
Andrei Filyagin (Fair Russia) should take part in the upcoming tour together with Konovalov.
The Khakassian media suggests that Putin may accept the resignation of the head of Khakassia and assign a new risk to the head of the republic, as well as decide on the fate of Zimin.
Putin has already visited Khakassia in January of this year.
Along with Tuva, this republic is one of the president's favourite vacation spots.

More than 10 million Syrians have become refugees since the start of the seven-year armed conflict in Syria.
Around five million people fled to other countries, especially neighboring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
Now, according to Damascus, military action is nearing completion, and the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees.
This was stated by Syria's foreign minister, Walid al-Moallem, speaking at the UN: "Currently, the situation on the ground has become more stable and safe due to the successes achieved in the fight against terrorism.
The government continues to restore areas destroyed by terrorists, bringing them back to normal life.
All conditions have been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to a country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions, which have complicated people's lives and deprived them of their livelihoods.
The Syrian authorities also urged the international community to contribute to the return of refugees and allocate funds for this.
Meanwhile, the United States and EU countries refuse to provide assistance to Syria, claiming that a political solution to the conflict must first be found.

In February, the company's management announced that the commitments have already been fulfilled in relation to 83% of vehicles, so that the program will be completed ahead of schedule.
Volkswagen is striving to offset losses and regain customer confidence.
For example, the management of the concern recently changed again, as well as it was announced about large-scale restructuring and fundamental changes in the management system.
Moreover, "Volkswagen" promises to buy out even new cars if German cities ban diesel on their streets: this power was granted in February of this year.

Metropolitan Hilarion compares Kiev's decision to rename UPC with actions of fascists
Metropolitan Hilarion, Head of the Synodal Department for External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists against Jews.
"It's like in fascist Germany pushing a yellow star on a Jew, which means marking the Church as an enemy organisation, and it is for this purpose that this bill was created," said the metropolitan on the television channel Russia-24 (quoted from Interfax).
According to him, this step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is in an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to gain full control of the UMC and "put it out of law," believes the minister.
"It is a Ukrainian church, and believers in this church consider themselves Ukrainian, they are patriots of their country," he added.
Earlier, it became known that deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working to implement bills No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on special status of religious organizations), and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter suggests renaming the Moscow Patriarchate.

Deputy of the Pochaev Lavra called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian holy places
Metropolitan Vladimir, Deputy of the Holy Dormition Laurels of Pochaev, called for the protection of the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian holy sites.
The text of his address to believers of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was published on Saturday on the website of the monastery.
At various times in history, our predecessors and native Christians had to profess their faith and protect their holy places.
Given the situation that has developed, and according to the information we have and the threats of reprisals that are spreading, it is clear that we will also have to experience something‚Äù, the Metropolitan stated.
He asked for support - prayerful, moral.
Also, the lieutenant of Laura stressed that, probably, "your physical presence will be needed."
The priest added: "Lenin's grandchildren are spiritually threatened with reprisal, and, as such, we will defend our holy site."
Who cares about the fate of the Pochaev Lavra, the orthodox Ukrainian and world relic, should be prepared to protect it, the appeal says.
The Metropolitan has called on those who mislead believers not to go ahead.
The UOC has a canonical status determined by Tomos on October 29, 1990 from Mother Church.
Now someone wants to add to the news patriarch and friend of the Catholic pope, Roman Bartholomew.
The new style, with its consequences, is unacceptable to us by the Orthodox.
And we are pleased with the status our church has‚Äù, noted the Laura deputy.
He recalled that the UOC since October 1990 has been canonically independent and fully independent in its management.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, our Church already has Tomos.
What else do we need Tomos?" noted Metropolitan Vladimir Pochaevsky, urging believers and all citizens to wonder if other Tomos confessions have, are they independent of the Vatican?
To some extent, the believers understood and decided which temple they should go to.
However, someone wants to sow enmity and discord again.
Some are envious that domes are shining on the temples they want to destroy," stressed the minister.
Pochaev Lavra is the largest temple complex and a monastery in Western Ukraine.
It is located on the top of the Pochaev mountain, 70 kilometres from Ternopil.
The first historical data about it date back to the beginning of the XIII century.

Another sad post by Buzova in Instagram angered subscribers
The singer and television presenter, Olga Buzova, cannot survive the "betrayal" of Evgeny Nazarova, a participant of the show "For Buzova" who preferred her money and left the project.
The secular lion published another sad post in Instagram, which angered its subscribers.
"Never thought the senses could have a price.
My life continues to teach ... and when I start to understand people," Buzova wrote.
Many fans reacted negatively to such a post and noted that in reality the singer "did not see real life."
"You haven't suffered that yet.
You cling to every word, and live in a normal, regular family," wrote Enataliama37.
There were also those who advised Buzova to turn to psychologists or at least read books on the topic.
"Can you read psychology literature?

If we continue to play well, victories will come
The head coach of Moscow's "Dynamo" Vladimir Vorobyov - about the defeat of "Avtomobilist" (0:1) in the match of the regular KHL championship.
"A good game was interesting, even though it went up to the goal," Vorobyov's official website, Automobilist, cites.
"They tried to play very simply.
I really liked the first period.
They didn't use a few good moments.
In the second period, the opponent pulled us a little, we stood.
But removing us was a little "feeding."
The guys played great, performed a coaching unit.
I think if we continue to play well, victories will come.
Not scored, the game's goals are not won with zero, but the content of the game was the right one.
The luck will come if we continue to play in this direction."
"In your opinion, has "Avtomobilist" increased compared to the meeting in Nizhny Novgorod?"
"Then there was no foreign link.
At the pre-season, the teams solved other tasks, played many young boys.

Every resident of Kalmykia is a debtor
Republicans increasingly visit the official website of the Federal Bailiff Service for the Republic of Kazakhstan.
According to specialists of the department of organizational - control work, informatization and ensuring information security of the republican agency, over the past eight months more than 140 thousand visits to the site itself have been registered, more than 42 thousand - the section "Bank of data of executive industries", 661 payment receipts on payment of debts have been downloaded.
According to Valery Bogdanov, Chairman of the Public Council at the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation for the Republic of Kazakhstan, almost every resident of the region receives debts for public utilities, fines from the STSI, bank loans, loans, and no one is immune from unexpected situations.
But debtors may face negative consequences, such as a travel ban.
That is why the RCFSP of Russia recommends that anyone who has planned a trip abroad should specify information about the availability of unpaid debts in the bailiffs' department at the place of residence or on the website www.r08fssprus.ru and repay them.
The service created a "Bank of Executive Productions" for the convenience of citizens.
This special electronic application is available not only on regional websites of UFSSP of Russia, but also in social networks and mobile communications tools iPad, iPhone and smartphone.
The data bank contains information on enforcement proceedings initiated by the Kalmyk bailiffs in relation to all debtors, explains Delgir Bodgayev, Assistant Head of the Russian Federal Security Service for the RK.
"In the presence of debts, the system displays information about the number and date of the initiation of enforcement proceedings; the name of the authority that issued the executive leaf or another act; its number, amount and type of debt; the address of the bailiffs department; the name of the bailiff; the contact phone number.
Information on the progress of enforcement proceedings can also be obtained on the portal of public services at: http://epgu.gosuslugi.ru"

Then there is the head of the republic, together with the bodyguard, and in a few seconds an explosion is heard.
During the terrorist attack in Donetsk, Alexander Zakharchenko and his guard were killed and 11 people were injured.
According to investigators, the explosive device was hidden in one of the lamps and activated by a phone call.
The authorities of the unrecognized republic qualified the incident as a terrorist act and accused Kiev and Western intelligence agencies of involvement in the murder of Zakharchenko.

Chief Macedonian oppositionist refuses to vote in referendum
A referendum on the intergovernmental agreement with Greece on the renaming of the Republic of Macedonia is underway in Macedonia on Sunday, September 30.
Citizens are asked to answer one question: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?"
However, the leader of the leading opposition party, Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity (WMO-DPMNE), Christian Mitskovsky, stated that he would not vote in the referendum.
As explained by the press secretary of the party, Naum Stoilkovsky, Mitskovsky decided to abstain from voting in order to express his opposition to the treaty, which he considers "dangerous."
According to the press secretary, the current referendum resolves the issue of renaming the country and nothing more, while the party's strategic goal is to achieve membership in NATO and the EU.
A week ago, President of Macedonia Georgy Ivanov also declined to participate in the referendum on September 30.
He explained that he chose the country's name 27 years ago in the referendum on independence.
"A new semi-sovereign state with a new name is being created," noted Ivanov.
The agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic - the Republic of Northern Macedonia - was signed by the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Macedonia and Greece on June 17 of this year during a solemn ceremony on the shore of Lake Prespa, which runs the border between the two countries.
The treaty should resolve a long-term dispute about the country's name, as well as Skopje's path to NATO and the EU, recalls TASS.
A fire broke out at the restaurant of Istanbul's "mem chef"
In the Istanbul restaurant Nusret, whose chef, Nusret Gocce, became famous for his manner of salting steaks and becoming a mema hero, there was a fire during a fire show with dishes, reports Sputnik.
According to preliminary data, the waiter confused additives for fire-prepared meat steaks.
As a result, the flames burned even more strongly and spread over the guests sitting behind the bar.
It was reported that five people received strong burns - two waiters and three Czech tourists.
Moreover, the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that only two Czech tourists were injured.
According to the diplomatic agency, burns were recorded in the injured woman by 35% of the body, and in the man by 15%, writes RIA Novosti.
In this case, it is about second-degree burns, and in a woman - with a deep insight into the structure of the skin.
Turkish chef Nusret Gocce is known on the internet for his sophisticated way of sprinkling steaks with salt and spices.
It was reported that he ordered himself a large-scale PR campaign in different countries, in which Leonardo Di Caprio visited the Nusreta restaurant in Dubai.
A fire broke out at the Old Ambar restaurant in Kazan on April 1.

EU allocates ‚Ç¨1.5 million to help Indonesian victims
The EU (EU) has allocated ‚Ç¨1.5 million to Indonesia to combat the aftermath of the earthquake and the tsunami.
This was reported on September 30 by the press service of the European Commission.
In order to monitor the provision of assistance, the European Commission sent its experts to the region.
As noted, funds will be used for disinfection, as well as providing victims with food, water, temporary refuges and medicines.
The commission also granted Indonesian authorities access to satellite maps of the European Emergency Service Copernicus ("Copernicus") to assess the damage.
The United States has also expressed willingness to help eliminate the aftermath of a natural disaster, said in a statement released by US State Department spokesman Heather Nowert.
It is also reported that the US diplomatic mission in Indonesia did not receive reports of injured American citizens.

U.S. settles growth in opium production in Afghanistan
The aggravation of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26 was much discussed in Tehran.
Multilateral consultations involving Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia were held there, represented by Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, militants launched a real terrorist war on Afghan territory against state authorities and civilians of the country.
This year has become a record-breaking number of bloody terrorist attacks that killed thousands of ordinary Afghans‚Äù, noted Patrushev.
Afghanistan's troubles did not begin yesterday.
After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the main enemy of the United States was declared the terrorist group Al-Qaeda (prohibited in the Russian Federation), which settled in Afghanistan.
Within a month, America and the NATO allies launched a military operation called "Indestructible Freedom" there.
17 years have passed.
Many thousand U.S. contingents are now on Afghan soil.
And peace life is even more ghostly than it was then.
American troops have been driven over fences of dozens of their bases.
How can they buy off fighters for money - as long as they are not touched.
The government of Afghanistan controls a smaller portion of the country - 40%, according to Patrushev.
50% - the Taliban movement (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
Another 10% is for ISIS terrorists (prohibited in Russia).
On the other hand, they are growing quickly there.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia - exactly what they failed in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be doing it.
How satisfying it is that, in the 17 years of the American presence, the production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan increased by at least 40 times.
Colossal growth in areas planted with opium poppy and multi-billion dollar profits.

Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on EU and NATO membership, provided the country's name is changed.
The agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia into the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on June 17 as a result of long negotiations with neighbouring Greece, which refused to recognise for its northern neighbour the right to be called Macedonia, seeing in such a name an attempt on the Greek province of the same name and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovsky, political scientist: "Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or Northern Macedonia receive the right to a better future, the hope of social change.
And Greece will secure the right to its past.
There is no perfect deal.
They come from difficult compromises that cannot make everyone happy."
The ruling social democrats, headed by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, are in favour of renaming the country.
Conservative opposition and President Georgy Ivanov are against.
According to journalist Tsvetin Chilimanov, Macedonia does not make sense to join the EU - it is enough to have partnership with him: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government headed by Zaev is imposed from outside in order to change the country's name.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
Above all, I will lose my sovereignty.
Obviously, there are countries that do not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans."
Fay Dulgeri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the biggest challenge in its history.
The country is at a crossroads.
The choice that citizens of Macedonia make will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but of Europe as a whole."

RF Ministry of Finance forecasts the ruble exchange rate for 17 years ahead
The Ministry of Finance of Russia expects a gradual weakening of the exchange rate of the rouble - up to 73.9 roubles per dollar by 2031-2035, follows from the draft long-term budget forecast submitted to the State Duma together with the draft federal budget.
In 2021-2025, the exchange rate of the rouble, according to forecast, will amount to 66.4 roubles per dollar, in 2026-2030 - 71.1 roubles, and in the next five years - 73.9.
The agency notes that these figures are a nominal rate.
The real effective rate (a measure that takes into account the exchange rates of the countries that are the main trading partners of the Russian Federation) will remain stable, officials assure.
As far as inflation is concerned, it will amount to 3.5% by 2020, and will then stabilize at around 4%, the Ministry of Finance believes.

Peskov answered the question about possible support for Serbia over Kosovo
A spokesman for the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov believes that so far it is premature to talk about whether Russia will provide assistance to Serbia after the escalation in Kosovo.
According to him, first negotiations should be held between the leaders of the two countries.
A representative of the Kremlin told journalists of "Govorit Moscow" radio station about this on Sunday, September 30.
On September 29, the resident of Serbia, Aleksandr Vuchic, announced that he intends to discuss the situation in Kosovo with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the upcoming meeting in Moscow on October 2.
The Serbian leader also planned to ask for support of Moscow in the current situation, specifying that military assistance in this case is not discussed.
Vucic noted that he would like to maintain peace in the region and intends to do everything necessary for this.
Earlier that day, it became known that the President of Serbia ordered that the armed forces of the country be brought to a state of highest combat readiness.
