The number of recruits from Ukraine preparing to be sent to Donbass is named
The official representative of the People ’ s Militia of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People ’ s Republic ( LNR ) Andrei Marochko said that in the winter of 2018-2019 Ukraine will send at least 3,000 new recruits to Donbass .
According to him , in this way Kiev plans " at least somehow to complete the units " .
" The unwillingness of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces , mass dismissals have resulted in a low number of units , " said Marochko , quoted by RIA Novosti .
He also did not rule out that the real numbers of Ukrainians called into the army could be increased if necessary .
In 2014-2017 , Kiev launched the so-called anti-terrorist operation ( ATO ) , which was later replaced by the Joint Forces ( JPS ) operation .
It was supposed that this measure would strengthen the role of Ukrainian security forces in the settlement of the situation .
At the end of August 2018 , the situation in Donbass was aggravated by the murder of the head of the DPR Alexander Zakharchenko .
The authorities of the DPR qualified the incident as a terrorist attack .
During the investigation of the criminal case , several persons involved in the explosion were detained .
According to preliminary data , they confirmed that the sabotage was organized by the Ukrainian special services .

The head of the British Foreign Ministry compared the EU with the Soviet Union and the prison
British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union with the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of capping the member states of the community .
The diplomat made such a statement at the Congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham , which opened on Sunday , September 30 .
As the Daily Mail notes , thus Hunt commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process .
What happened to the belief in the European dream and its ideals ?
The EU was created to protect freedom , and the Soviet Union did not let anyone leave it .
The lesson of history is obvious : if you turn the EU from a community to a prison , the desire to leave it will not decrease , but will only grow , and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to escape from captivity , ” the minister said .
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for the decision to leave the European Union will only aggravate the crisis , Gazeta.ru said .
In mid-September , British Prime Minister Theresa May said that the Brexit talks were deadlocked .
So she commented on the results of the informal summit of the European Union in Salzburg .
The Brexit decision was made in 2016 following a referendum .
The withdrawal of the United Kingdom is expected to take place before April 2019 , but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by many factors .
In particular , there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community .
In addition , the question of the Irish border remains open .
Further information on European water policy , as well as the full text of legislative acts and other documents are available on the website of the Commission .

Telegram users complained about a malfunction of the new version
Users of the iPhone complained about problems in the work of the messenger Telegram after the update , released on September 28 .
The user ’ s phone number can be found on his username
The complaints relate to gadgets with the current iOS 12 operating system .
According to their owners , after the update , the application shows a white screen or closes immediately .
Representatives of the messenger reacted to the failure .
According to them , the problem may be related to the migration of information to a new application written in Swift .
Telegram temporarily suspended the automatic update of the application until troubleshooting .
On April 13 , the Tagansky court of Moscow granted Roskomnadzor ’ s claim to block the messenger Telegram in Russia .
Three days later , the communication operators began to implement the decision .
The reason was the refusal of the messenger administration to provide the FSB with the keys to decrypt the correspondence necessary to obtain information about terrorists .
In August , Telegram changed the privacy policy and agreed to disclose the IP address and mobile phone number of a suspected terrorist user upon receipt of the relevant court decision .
Telegram audience reduced by 1.2 million after blocking in Russia

Ilon Musk is forced to leave the post of head of Tesla Board of Directors
The US Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla ’ s founder , Ilon Musk , settled their dispute over fraud .
This is reported by CNBC News .
According to the TV channel , within the framework of the agreements reached Masku will have to leave the post of the head of the board of directors of Tesla .
At the same time , the commission allowed Mask to retain the position of head of Tesla .
As noted , the founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $ 20 million .
The same amount will be charged to Tesla .
At the same time , the money will be distributed among the affected investors .
In addition , the company must appoint two independent directors .
Ilon Musk is an American businessman who is on the list of 50 richest people on the planet according to Forbes magazine .
He is the head of SpaceX Space Corporation , Neuralink Neurotheological Company and the developer of Tesla electric cartels , as well as the co-founder of Paypal .
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had previously sued Tesla CEO Ilon Mask because of his tweeted announcement about the possible buyback of the company .
Last month , Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy back all shares on the stock exchange at a fixed price of $ 420 .
The stock price of $ 420 was established allegedly " because of the significance of this number in the marijuana culture " , reported earlier Bloomberg agency citing the co-director of the security department of the commission Stephen Peikin .
At the same time , Ilon Musk subsequently abandoned his plans to redeem the shares .
Commenting on the lawsuit filed against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission , the businessman said that he considered the charges of fraud unfounded , and added that he was very disappointed and saddened by these claims .
" Honesty is the most important value in my life , and the facts will prove that I in no way violated it , " the businessman said in an interview with CNBC .
In August , a group of Tesla shareholders filed a collective lawsuit against Mask , complaining about the financial losses incurred .
The plaintiffs claimed that the positions of the businessman had caused them losses .
In particular , one shareholder stated that tweets of the businessman were misleading , which led Tesla stock sellers to purchase papers at artificially high prices to cover their positions .
Other plaintiffs also noted that Ilon Mask 's careless remarks led to sharp fluctuations in the course .
In September , Ilona Maska accused the head of the research company Citron Research of exchange fraud .
In the meantime , if Musk could not resolve his dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission , he would be threatened with being suspended from the company ’ s management and even a prison .
The former chairman of the commission Harvey Pitt said this to CNBC TV .
Mask is " a good guy who does not know how to manage a car company . "
Я подумал : " Ух ты , как тесен мира ! "
" Yes , yes , how was it ? " he thought , remembering a dream . " Yes , how was it ? "

The discovery of penicillin marked the beginning of an era of modern antibiotics , brought Fleming world fame and made him a Nobel laureate .

Trump talks about “ love ” in Kim Jong-un
From mutual cruelty , the leaders of the US and the DPRK almost fell in love with each other , Donald Trump joked .
US President Donald Trump has noted a successful joke about his successes on the front of resolving the North Korean crisis .
Starting with the mutual threats of destruction , now the leaders of the two countries have adjusted the relationship so much that they are almost in love with each other , the American president said .
The White House owner recalled that he had accepted the North Korean problem from the previous administration as the main difficulty in foreign policy .
Trump pointed out that Barack Obama ’ s team had launched relations with the DPRK so much that it could not even call the country ’ s leadership – there they simply did not remove the pipe .
At that time , the US and the DPRK were on the brink of war , and today the North Korean leader writes “ beautiful letters ” to the White House , Trump said .
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work , too , he was " cruel " to Kim Jong-un , which , however , was mutual .
But now their relationship has so much changed that the leaders " fell in love with each other " .
At the same time , Trump has asked not to take his words literally and warned that the American media are blaming them for incompetence .
Trump has pointed out that Pyongyang has recently stopped nuclear and missile testing , and is also closing military test sites .
All this is the merit of the work of his administration , the American president is sure .
Last Tuesday , Donald Trump flattered Kim Jong-un from the rostrum of the UN General Assembly .
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for his courage and steps taken to de-escalate tensions .
At the same time , Trump noted that the sanctions against the DPRK would continue until the Korean Peninsula was completely denuclearized .
Negotiations in Singapore
On June 12 , the first ever talks between the leaders of the United States and North Korea took place in Singapore .
After a serious aggravation of relations and mutual threats of use of nuclear weapons , the summit looked like a turning point in the protracted US-Korean crisis .
Following the talks , the sides expressed their intention to move towards a peaceful resolution of the contradictions , although they did not undertake any legal obligations .
A positive outcome of the meeting was the cessation of nuclear and missile tests by the DPRK , as well as the return to the United States of the remains of American soldiers in the country .
At the same time , other practical steps towards the denuclearization of North Korea are still stalled .
The media reported that after the Singapore summit , the US had already sent several disarmament scenarios to the DPRK , but Pyongyang rejected them , calling them " gangster " .

Nitsoy called to replace " Moscow language with Ukrainian product "
Ukrainian children 's writer and wrestler for purity of native language Larisa Nitsoy called to displace from Ukraine " the Russian-language Moscow product and the Moscow language " .
It offers to do this with a Ukrainian product - " cultural wave , cultural onslaught " .
Nitsoy shared her thoughts on the " expediency of eliminating the Russian language in Ukraine " with the Ukrainian publication " Observer " .
According to her , the corresponding Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it even already exists and continues to develop further .
Over time , Ukrainians will " recover " from this " Moscow language " , she is convinced .
For example , in neighboring Poland , she said , earlier on television and radio , Russian speech was widely used , but in public space it practically remained .
At the same time , according to Nitsa , Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process : the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language , in her opinion , are only " the expansion of the borders for the Ukrainian speech at the legislative level " .
Earlier , Nitsa shared her experience of maintaining the " Ukrainian-speaking regime " in a children 's camp in Carpathians , where she was invited to work .
In December 2016 , she threatened to court a network of Watsons bookstores , a cashier of one of whom communicated with her in Russian .
Having failed her , Nitsoy rushed to the girl to hand over .
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians she calls " linguistic schizophrenia " , urging Ukrainians to give up Russian letters even in the writing of surnames .
Recently , Nitsoy said that the name " Rus " was stolen from Ukrainians , so Russia should be called Moscow .
The anger of the writer could not escape even the Security Service of Ukraine : having come there and having heard conversations of the employees with each other in Russian , she caused a scandal and left , slamming the door .

This was announced on Sunday by the spokesman of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Tony Angelovsky .
Since the opening of polling stations there have been 4 incidents , which have been eliminated , - he said .

We call on citizens to observe the laws and refrain from any violations of public order and tranquillity and any violation of the secrecy of the vote , " said the representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs .
Citizens are asked to answer one question during a referendum on Sunday : " Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic ? "
The referendum is intended to resolve the 27-year dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav Republic , which coincides with the name of the northern Greek region .

It provides for the use of the name " Republic of Northern Macedonia " .

Kosachev : At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly , the topic of Russia was almost absent in a negative way
The head of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs Konstantin Kosachev considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly successful for Russia and does not exclude that it will be able to become a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in the solution of global problems .
" The uniqueness of this 73rd session , in my opinion , is that the rhetoric that we have become almost accustomed to in recent years with regard to Russia has now been much more muted , " said the senator in an interview published on Sunday by the Russian newspaper .
He explained that in previous years the Russian Federation sometimes " identified as one of the three main threats to mankind , then along with Ebola , then along with climate change or terrorism , Russia was in this series , at least in the statement of a group of Western countries , which in this regard expressed quite unanimously " .
At the 73rd session , Kosachev stressed , " Russia 's topic was virtually absent in a negative way . "
" If I carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States , the President of France , the speech of the German Foreign Minister , I now do not take Ukraine , Georgia , or the British , in any case , the choir was not exactly , " the politician said , noting that Russia " was no longer a wall , about which punch trains " .
The head of the relevant committee of the Security Council does not rule out that this is indicative of a trend which , in his opinion , " will single out the current session of the [ UN General Assembly ] , although this trend may fully manifest itself in a year , two or three " .
" I do not rule out that this session in a sense can be a turning point , " Kosachev admitted , explaining that " there are too many examples of how Russia can move forward in international affairs with its involvement " .
As an example , he cited the situations in Syria , around Iran and North Korea .
“ Unfortunately , this is not Ukraine yet , but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time , ” added the parliamentarian .
This is due to the fact , he believes , that there is " an adequate , sound perception of Russia as not just a possible - an integral participant in solving the global problems of the present day " .
" I don 't want to make a mistake , but I have a feeling that we are going through a point where the movement will no longer be a reversal , it will be a move forward , " he added .
Kosachev called another " interesting and important feeling " in this context " a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop . "
" I attended very many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [ at the session of the General Assembly ] of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov , I held my own meetings , and I saw with great pleasure that if a year or two or five years ago Russian opinion , the Russian vision of what is happening in the world , by and large , nobody was interested , then now the situation is different , " said the Chairman of the Committee of the Council .
In his opinion , this is due to the fact that " the so-called new liberal order , which represents the West , has no answers to questions on how to solve world problems due to the obvious lack of ideas in the global space , lack of ideas on how to solve the problems of the Middle East , problems of terrorism , problems of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , problems of migration " .
" And here the request for a Russian vision becomes more and more obvious , " Kosachev expressed confidence , stressing that in this sense " this session is successful for the work of the Russian delegation , successful for Russia . "

In Damascus declared their right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that the Syrian province of Idlib will not have to use military force , said Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem .
At the same time , he said , Syria has the right to do so .
The Minister added that Turkey has the opportunity to quickly solve the problem of the withdrawal of fighters of the banned organization in Russia Jebhat al-Nusra from the demilitarized zone in Idlib , RIA Novosti reports .
The head of the Foreign Ministry also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to a military solution to the problem of territories east of the Euphrates if the Kurds were to seek separatism .
At the same time , according to Muallem , the talks with Kurdish SDF forces were good until they were interrupted because of the US .
On September 17 , Putin and Turkish President Recep Erdogan agreed to establish a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between the armed opposition and government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib by October 15 .

The authorities named the amount of " golden parachute " of the Voronezh deputy governor
The one-time payment of 23 salaries to the deputy governor of the Voronezh region Yury Agibalov was made on the basis of the regional law " On State Positions " .
At the same time , the real amount of the " golden parachute " released from office of the vrio official was several times less than the amount announced in the media .
Such explanations were provided by the press service of the regional government .
According to the law , the salary for the occupied position of Agibalov is 11,189 rubles .
Thus , stressed in the press service , the amount of the one-time payment made less income tax 223,892 rubles , instead of 1 million rubles , which was written by the media .
The official has received an old-age insurance pension since July 2018 .
His seniority in public office is more than nine years .
Assignment of this pension and lump-sum payment is made immediately after dismissal from the post , explained to RIA Novosti agency in the regional government .
At the same time , payment of the pension supplement to Agibalov was suspended at the time of appointment to the state office , and his salary did not change in comparison with the previous period .
The victorious governor of the region , Alexander Gusev , took office on September 15 .
Agibalova was dismissed due to the expiration of the term of office of the head of the region .
Similarly , the powers of other officials who held public office in the region were completed .
On September 29 , the Telegram channel " Nezygary " published documents from which it was clear that Agibalov , who had left the post of vice-governor , paid a termination indemnity of 23 salaries , and two days later , he again received a similar position without a " vrio " .

Onishchenko holds the post of First Deputy Chairman of the Committee on Education and Science .
Based on the experience of his work , he noted in an interview that teenagers to masturbation provokes harmful information that they find on the Internet .
It is worth fighting this at the level of educational institutions and the family , the deputy added .
Gennady Onishchenko , Deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation ( in an interview with the radio station " Says Moscow " :
As part of the general sex education of children , this should be done by explaining the paguba , because there is a risk determined to the sexual health of the child , both boy and girl .
The problem is objective , it is that the ripening of children comes early enough , and there are further large scissors between their puberty and the ability to formally enter into intersex contacts .
According to Onishchenko , the solution of the problem is hindered by " bigotry " , the silence of " sexual age problems " and the lack of a culture of adequate upbringing of children .
The doctor is sure that many teenagers are faced with the onanism .
The MP believes that to practice lessons about the harm of onanism first of all is in schools of " hyperbaric " regions .
" If we start this conversation in our Muslim republic , we will simply not be understood by you , to put it mildly , " said the professor .

AdG became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant " Alternative for Germany " beats another record of popularity , and Angela Merkel 's ratings are falling .
Apparently , the people of Germany have begun to be seriously tired of Angela Merkel ’ s immigration policy , which has made the country the desired target for millions of refugees from the Middle East .
This is most evident in recent social surveys , according to which the anti-immigrant party Alternative for Germany is becoming more popular , and the positions of the ruling bloc Merkel and Seehofer are weakening .
This week , the AdG hit another record , rising to the second line in the rating of popular sympathies .
Right-wing conservatives , with 17 percent of popularity , managed to bypass the Social Democrats , who have about 16 percent .
The gap of one percentage point could be written off for statistical error , but the fact that the ADG , created in 2013 from a small group of Euroskeptics economists , had managed to become a serious political force .
The leadership in the overall ranking continues to hold the ruling CSU / CDU bloc , which has about 30 percent .
However , there is a tendency to lose points - as early as April , support for Angela Merkel ’ s bloc was four percentage points higher .
The personal rating of the German Chancellor , who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term , is also decreasing .
Today , 48 percent of Germans support Angela Merkel , 7 percent lower than last year .
Let us add that the Social Democrats were followed by the " green " ( 15 % ) , the left ( 11 % ) and the liberals ( 10 % ) .
Evolution of " Alternatives "
The Alternative for Germany Party was established in September 2012 on the basis of the Alternative Choice 2013 group , which included people from the Christian Democratic Union .
The group initially opposed the government policy , but initially dealt only with economic issues , including the euro and EU cooperation .
At the same time , the group opposed the " sponsorship " by Germany of weak EU economies , did not rule out the possibility of a return to the German mark and a complete withdrawal of the country from the EU .
Against the background of the deepening immigration crisis , the political platform of the ADG has expanded .
In 2013 , the group became a full-fledged party , which took the niche of Euroskeptics and began to harshly criticize the government for the failure of immigration policy .
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017 , the APG managed to break through the Bundestag for the first time , having received 94 seats ( out of 709 ) .
Two representatives of " Alternatives for Germany " get seats in the European Parliament .
Published a video with a journalist who called the citizens of Ukraine " a nation of bolvans "

As Drozdov noted , it is difficult to live and work in such a country .
" We have not been taught a culture of reading and accepting texts since our childhood , " the journalist said .
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov ’ s words , accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed .
As previously reported , the State Committee on Television and Radio Broadcasting of the Nezalezhnaya began to fight with literature , which has the slightest hint of criticism of the Kiev authorities , banning the import of 201 editions .

Anyone can purchase this car .
Roshel Defence Solutions announced that it is already accepting applications for its new armored vehicle .
Roshel Senator APC Armoured Apocalypse
On the subject of the apocalypse , money does not only make video games , film studios and book publishing houses .
Automotive companies are now mastering a new niche for themselves .
So , the Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions presented its apocalypse apocalypse Senator APC .
The engineers of this company create armored vehicles for the police during their free time .
Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers , who are not comfortable but safely placed in an all-welded armored capsule .
This bunker , otherwise the design will not be called , as the level of its reservation corresponds to the B7 standard , is installed on the chassis of the powerful Ford Super Duty pickup .
Its bottom , also armoured , is able to protect the capsule from grenade and anti-personnel mine explosions .
Roshel Senator APC Apocalypse Armoured Infantry Fighting Vehicle
In order not to damage the passengers even the explosive wave from the shell that exploded next to the car , the cabin of the car is equipped with special cushioning seats .

In order to ensure that the heavy weight of the armoured vehicle does not affect its mobility , Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-strong 6.7 litre turbo-diesel engine , the power of which is transferred to the four wheels of the armored vehicle through a 6-stage automatic gearbox .
There is no chance to get stuck at the Roshel Senator APC apocalypse
The Roshel Senator APC ’ s apocalypse will be seen at a specialized exhibition in Washington , D.C. , which will take place in October .

Named the death date of the universe
The universe will last for about 140 billion years , ten times the age of the observed world , about 13.8 billion years .
The study of the international team of scientists is published in the library of electronic preprints arXiv.org and is aimed at publishing in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan , the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun reports .
The experts came to such conclusions by watching with the help of the Hyper Suprime-Cam camera of Subaru telescope for about ten million galaxies .
After tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy , which account for more than 95 per cent of the energy mass of the observed world , scientists , working under the standard cosmological model <unk> CDM ( <unk> Cold Dark Matter ) , estimated the pace of expansion of the universe , which was slightly slower than previously thought .
A press release from the Subaru Observatory noted that the observations had produced a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe , and the inclusion of data from the European space telescope Planck had clarified the limitations imposed on the LCDM parameters .
In July , scientists modeled the possible death of the universe .
Three years earlier , their colleagues presented new arguments that the observed world would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Great Gap .
So , even if I had convinced you to do something , it is sometimes difficult to get some action as a result .
All that exists in the world is just a dream .
Another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum failed
The opportunity to hear the people 's opinion on pension reform is postponed indefinitely
A meeting of the federal referendum initiative group against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday .
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups , who registered different wording of questions ( the Central Election Commission registered five formulations ) .
They decided to apply to the CEC for the registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians the question : " Are you in favour of not raising the age of eligibility for old-age pension as defined by the legislation on pension provision as of July 1 , 2018 ? "
This wording was registered by the Vologda subgroup , whose representatives did not participate in the meeting , but it was considered to be the simplest and most legally binding .
The majority of the participants of the meeting were supporters of a member of Fair Russia Ilya Sviridov ( six subgroups ) and KPRF ( four subgroups ) .
They were joined by three independent subgroups from Nizhny Novgorod , Voronezh and Orenburg .
Earlier , Sviridov said to Vedomosti that invitations were sent to all the initiators , and about 40 subgroups agreed to come .
But , for example , Marina Semenova , the head of the Vologda subgroup ( her wording was supported by another 15 subgroups ) , said to Vedomosti that the invitations did not receive and to come did not plan : " We did not understand who the friend , and who the enemy " .

В матче " Локо " - " Ахмат " ошибки Турбина сыпались , как из рога изоблия
The former judge of the All-Union category Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of the referee Evgeny Turbin in the match of the 9th round of the Russian championship " Lokomotiv " - " Akhmat " and dismantled the controversial episodes of the game .
- How you estimate refereeing of Evgeny Turbin in the match " Lokomotiv " - " Akhmat " ?
- I consider that this arbitrator confirmed his unsuitability to refereeing matches of the Russian Premier League .
I am surprised that the pressure in the meeting of the fifth round of " Spartak " - " Dynamo " , neither Turbin himself , nor the DSI leaders made serious conclusions about his low qualification .
The result didn 't slow down to affect in the ninth round : mistakes in his actions , private omissions of rough receptions fell as from a horn of abundance .
For example , on the 50th minute of the railway worker Eder is throwing a defender , Ahmata Rodolfo , with the help of hands in his penalty area .
From the gate is eight meters , but Turbin does not put a penalty .
- How you estimate an episode involving Idov who was on the 82nd minute when it seemed that the ball got to it in hand ?
- I consider that here there was a deliberate game with the hand of the defender in the penalty area .
Turbin was close to the moment , seeing the episode well and his first assistant on the right .
This moment should have been seen by reserve judge Sergey Karasev .
However , all three slept and the penalty was not appointed .
Therefore the score in the match is distorted , and sports justice was violated .
It was the very case when refereeing by concept ousted and buried the sports spirit of the game .
- On the 52nd minute Turbin didn 't decide to remove the defender of guests Oleg Ivanov who violated rules in fight against Krykhovyak , and when the judge showed him a yellow card , evidently applauded him .
What do you think about this episode ?
It was necessary to show the second " mustard " ?
- In this moment Turbin and the first yellow card showed not quite on business .
The second would be illogical .
- Oleg Ivanov told after the match about double standards of refereeing that some teams put penalties for such violations , as in an episode with Idov , and somehow isn 't present .
What do you estimate the words of a football player ?
- Looking what to understand by double standards .
There was a penalty .
He was not given .
Thus , the arbitrator does not give a second penalty in the opposite gate .
Here is the principle that is used .
And the second point of double standards that the judge looks who plays .
Here played on Saturday " Lokomotiv " and " Ahmata " have serious claims to work Turbin because the team was injured .
- The man changed the floor , became lesbian . A minute .
To his great joy , his team won the game .

Matt Damon played a rape accused Judge Cavanaugh at the SNL start
American actor Matt Damon played a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court Brett Cavanaugh , who is accused of rape .
Damon appeared in the first release of the new Saturday Night Live season on NBC .
In a small sketch , the actor played Cavanaugh at Senate hearings on charges of rape .
A candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court had previously drawn attention to his emotionality and detail of his stories during a conversation with Senator Amy Klobushar .
For example , Cavanaugh repeatedly confessed his love for beer , but said that he had never drunk to the memory .
In addition , in an attempt to justify himself on charges of rape , Kavano stated that he had been a virgin in those years .
These moments also beat Damon .
Я только и делал , что много пил и совсем не думал о секс .
I was the most proud , the most drunk virgin anyone ever saw .
Everyone knows it , " said Matt Damon , a judge .
Earlier , Cavanaugh was elected as the supreme judge of the United States .
But pay attention to the face and body language of everyone who is present in this fuzzy picture , and you will feel that they all play .
But my advice to you is to tell them that you have behaved badly and fled , and apologize .
Nothing , it is a football match , against Afula , we won , although the judge was a Jew .
Barbra Streisand discovered strange behavior in her cloned dogs
American singer Barbra Streisand said that clones of her dead dog behave quite differently than the original pet .
" They don 't look like that .
In fact , [ clones ] look like she , but it is impossible to clone the soul " , - the 76-year-old singer emphasized .
At the end of 2017 , Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old cat de tulear dog named Samantha , who had to sleep due to health problems .
In July 2018 , it was reported that a dog of the Chihuahua breed named Miracle Milly , who was called the smallest dog in the world , was cloned for the 49th time .
Experts clone a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature .
The United States pondered the naval blockade of Russia due to the supply of oil and gas
In the US , a maritime blockade of Russia could be imposed to gain an advantage in the global energy market .
The US authorities are so eager to fight for success in the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to the naval blockade of Russia , which remains one of the world ’ s major suppliers of energy .
On the possibility of a sea blockade the previous day told the head of the U.S. Interior Ministry Ryan Zinke .
Contrary to world practice , the United States Department of the Interior does not perform police but civilian functions , including natural resource policies .
Therefore , Zinke 's statement came within the competence of his department , although it was not devoid of political colour .
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh , Zinc said that , thanks to the US Navy , it controlled the sea routes in the Middle East region and could block them if necessary .
According to Zinke , the need may be related to Washington 's desire to prevent Russian supplies to the world energy market .
Zinke reminded that Russia still receives the lion ’ s share of its revenues from oil and gas supplies to the world market .
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motive of Moscow ’ s activation in this region , Zinke believes .
The Minister made it clear that the US still hopes to provide leadership in the global energy market by becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas .
To do this , Washington will have to sweep Russia and Iran , and the maritime blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure on this path , Zinke believes .

Islanders are urged to dig faster - Sakhalin MC
In the Sakhalin region , there is a campaign to immunize the population against influenza .
The doctors of the island region urge residents to be more active and not to ignore the recommendations of doctors .

Supersonic passenger aircraft in the Russian Federation to be put on serial production
Serial production of supersonic passenger aircraft in Russia will begin after 2030 .

The expensive violin was handed over to the pawnshop for a priceless
When a man brought a violin to the Lombard LBC Boutique and Loan , located in Somerville , Massachusetts , for a seemingly old and unprofitable instrument , the pawnshop worker offered only $ 50 .
But the experienced store manager Dylan McDermitt suspected that it is an ancient and expensive tool , and asked the expert for advice .
It turned out that the violin was made in <unk> by the famous Italian violin master Ferdinando Gagliano and is estimated at 250 thousand dollars .
Only the links to the violin are estimated at 16-18 thousand dollars .
The investigation revealed that the violin was recently stolen from a resident of the city , and the instrument was returned to the rightful owner .
It is not yet known how the violin got to the person who sent it to the pawnbar , but there are no previous conflicts with the law behind it .
The manager says that now all those bringing in the pawns violin will be asked to play on it to make sure that it really belongs to the client .

But England will defend its values , he stressed during a speech at the Congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham .

But the largest of them is Russia , which is increasing its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region .
Such statements of Western politicians Moscow repeatedly refuted , reports TASS .
At the same time , British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt said that Russia would have to pay a high price if it did not adhere to international rules and use chemical weapons .

Translator compared mentality of Russians and Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different , but few differences between them do not play a big role for mutual understanding .
This was announced on the International Day of the Translator , September 30 , by professional synchronous translator Berbel Saxe .
She has been translating Russian and English for over 30 years .
" The Germans like to plan events calmly , and the Russians , as the proverb says , " take a long time and go quickly . "
But it seems to me , for mutual understanding between nations and for the work of the translator it does not play a significant role , " said the expert in the commentary " RIA Novosti " .
According to the translator , to understand that two countries cannot do without each other , " it is enough to know history . "

Russia is a natural part of Europe , there is no point in trying to ignore it .

" I hope they will support as well , because now almost every game is full stadium , excellent atmosphere .
In the game , probably , the Lord today helped " Siberia " because very grossly mistaken , especially our leaders .
Generally lost micro - match 0 : 3 our leading leaders , so it was difficult to pull out this match though there were moments .
But , nevertheless , I will take the blame .
Because , apparently missed , something in preparation .

" This is an immaculate crony "
The audience is outraged by the choice of Agutin on the show " Voice "
Audience of the show " Voice 60 + " accuses the mentor Leonid Agutin of " immaculate nepotism and brazen fraud . "
When he heard the voice of his father , Nikolai Agutin , in blind auditions from the first notes , many hoped that he would remain neutral and not turn to the performer .
But the son 's feelings prevailed , and he chose a relative in his team .
Then many considered it a joke , but forgave the mentor bias in the first stage .
But the " joke " lasted , and the father of the star absolutely unjustifiably took the place of more worthy performers .
And now the audience is not ready to forgive Agutin such injustice .
Yesterday , we , the audience of the show , were indignant by the cunning and frankly dragging the close relatives on the final ladder .
I even doubted that Agutin would have enough strength and conscience not to drag his father to the end at all to the first place " , - Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina argued in the program " Man from TV " .
Meanwhile , for the sake of his father , Leonid Agutin " slashed " the beautiful performers who really sang , while Nikolay Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother , explaining it by the fact that the audience still want to see in the show of his father .
But , as it turned out , it at all not so , the audience want an objective assessment and to see in the ending really talented performers , and now Agutin discredited the show .
" I sympathize with the participants of the " Voices " from the Agutin team - they were doomed . "
" Last time Agutin showed how he loves dad , and today he had to show himself as a professional . "
" The contest has lost its meaning . "
" To remove two talented people from the project and leave in the project his dad who does not sing but whispers , how can you call a mentor after that ? "
" Like Dad singing , organize a concert in the Kremlin for your money and see how many people will come to this concert . "
Это шоу " Голос " , а не шоу " Крутые родинники " .
" This was unprofessional on the part of Agutin . "
" Then it is necessary to offer on own show to act pope , instead of on show which is made for money of Channel 1 . "
" It was a real chance for someone , and he took someone 's place .
And I don 't understand why a hollow dad should make me understand more than any other participant with real vocal data .
Why the worker from Surgut with a magnificent voice and timbre drained , and Papa Agutin brought to the ending ?
And then we all complain that on the stage and from screens the same faces for decades !

Then it didn 't come to mind to take a son into own team .
Moreover , he said , " Come on , come from here , everything is clear . "
Agutin could not act as a professional .

In addition , Kovalchuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of environmental technologies , as well as the risks that inevitably arise in the creation of such technologies .
" The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing , it is a huge benefit .
This is the explosive growth of medical technologies , improving the quality of life and infrastructure .
But there is a second side .
The development of natural technologies is actually a technological reproduction of wildlife systems .
There is a downside - purposeful interference in human life .
There are always risks .

Macedonia : referendum not held due to low turnout
The referendum was intended to endorse the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country " Northern Macedonia " .
Greece objected to the use by Macedonians of the name of its historical province .
The renaming promised the former Yugoslav Republic to open the way to NATO and later to the EU .
But , as the EFE agency reports , only 34 % of the turnout at the Sunday plebiscite " did not reach the constitutional threshold of 50 % .
However , since the referendum was only of a consultative nature , the Skopje authorities may decide not to abandon the renaming .
Speaking shortly after the closure of the polling stations , the Prime Minister of Macedonia , Zoran Zaev , a supporter of changing the name of the republic , said that if there were more " yes " among the votes cast , Macedonia would change the name , despite the unreached quorum .

On September 30 , on the famous Kemerovo page in the social network there was a report from an eyewitness that one of the local cemeteries was freely roasted .
The animals walked between the flock and the grass .
Commentators expressed different opinions : one of the local residents noted that in the presence of small cattle in the cemetery there is no harm , and their appetite can even help in clearing the territory from weeds and grasses , but some of the residents of the city did not have the behavior of animals to their liking :
“ It ’ s graves , not pasture .
There is nothing for the sheep there to do .

Давлать и довлеть - как правильно ?
Words of pressure do not exist .
Правильно - довлекать .
The word " give " in the meaning of " pull , influence , influence " exists only phonetically , because we hear the sound [ a ] instead of [ o ] in the word " catch " .
We use this word , believing that it comes from the word " pressure " .
But " pressure " and " catch up " ethymologically not only are not close , but even in some sense are opposite .
See for yourself .
To take ( church , book , old ) means " enough , full , enough , enough to be sufficient for anyone or anything , to satisfy " .
To be content , pleasure - related words .
Earlier it still had the value " not to depend on anything , to have a self-sufficient value " - " to get to itself " .
Старославянское " довьлети " родственно слования " велеть " и " воля " .
To press , to suppress - completely other .
These words have really frightening " relatives " : daos - " wolf " ( giving sheep ) , deyja - " die " and dvaidī - " oppress " .
A similar phonetic appearance of the words " pressure " and " catch up " , as well as the imminent obsolescence of the latter , forced them to conceive .
So we have this very " d [ a ] to drive " , which is also used on the letter through " a " , which , good , is wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of creation and development of these words .
Итак , правильно - довлекать .
But this word is obsolete , no longer used in its proper meaning .
If you want to note that any circumstances / people have a negative impact on you from above , use the word " pressure " .
It is also possible to use the " pressure " design , but remember that it is an office .

" It seems that Mercedes was much faster today , " Rikkonen said , F1News.Ru.
But the behavior of our machine was the best since the beginning of the weekend . "
" During the course of the qualification you didn 't concede in speed to Sebastian Fettel , but as a result the lag nevertheless turned out noticeable .

It will not be easy in any case , because our car is noticeably slower than Mercedes cars .

Russian bailiffs demanded debt with the dead old woman
In Kurgan bailiffs demanded from a long-dead woman to pay the state fee in the amount of 200 rubles .
This is reported by " Ural meridian " .
In mid-September , relatives of the deceased Maria Mitrofanovna Slepneva received a letter from the Kurgan Bailiffs ' Department , which reported that enforcement proceedings had been instituted against a 105-year-old woman .
The court ordered the woman to pay 200 rubles to the local tax inspectorate .
After receiving the letter , the relatives of Slepneva appealed to the department for clarifications .
The bailiffs ’ department promised to understand the situation .
The users of social networks , having learned about the incident , advised relatives to file counterclaims for non-payment of pension and social benefits to the old woman for the " lived " years after death .

Vučić maintains the highest level of readiness of the Serbian army
The President of Serbia , Alexander Vučić , ordered that the highest level of combat readiness to which the country 's armed forces had been transferred should be maintained because of the situation in the north of the autonomous province of Kosovo and Metohija .
" The President ordered to maintain the highest level of combat readiness , its cancellation will be a separate order , " said Serbian Defense Minister Alexander Vulin on Sunday , whose words are quoted by TASS .
According to him , the head of state is deeply concerned about the events in Kosovo .
At the same time , Vulin praised , the president of the republic expressed " pleasure of energy , labor , readiness and speed of military Serbia " .
Vučić himself stated the day before that he intends to discuss the situation in Kosovo and Metohija with Russian President Vladimir Putin and to ask the Russian leader for support .
According to available data , the meeting is scheduled for October 2 and is due to take place in Moscow .
At the same time , the Serbian leader stressed that he would do everything to preserve peace and said that he would like his country to be a peaceful , successful economy , a country of the future .
Last Saturday , 29 September , despite the international treaty ban , several dozen Kosovo special forces entered the Serb-populated north of Kosovo and Metohija , taking up positions around the Gazivode reservoir , taking control of Gazivode HPP and invading the Centre for Ecology and Development in Zubin Potok village .
This was done in connection with a visit to the north of Kosovo President Hashim Thaçi .
After some time , the Kosovo special forces left the positions .
It was after that that that the President of Serbia brought the country 's armed forces and police special forces into full combat readiness , and also protested to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg .

Through the operation in Syria , Russia has shielded itself from terrorists
During the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria , about 100,000 terrorists were killed , including 85,000 terrorists who destroyed the Russian Air and Space Forces .
This was told in connection with the third anniversary of the beginning of the Russian military operation in Syria by former head of the CCS , head of the Federation Defense and Security Council Committee Viktor Bondarev .
He noted the high precision in the use of air strikes : the space and air forces have carried out and continue to strike all attacks on terrorist targets .
According to Bondarev , tens of thousands of terrorist facilities have been destroyed in Syria in three years , such as ammunition depots , fortifications and headquarters .
With the help of Russian air strikes , the defense of jihadists was hacked - it was a decisive contribution to the advancement of the Syrian government troops , Interfax reports .
At the same time , according to Bondarev , the operation of our military in Syria allowed to protect Russia itself from terrorists , many of whom had Russian passports .
At the beginning of the operation in Syria , more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups , including the Islamic State ( ISIS , banned in Russia ) and Jabhat al-Nusra ( banned in Russia ) .
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation , about four thousand fighters from among Russian citizens and about five thousand citizens of post-Soviet countries fought on the side of the ISIS .
And we are talking only about the registered persons , not counting those who were not identified , Bondarev stressed .
Most of them were trained and ready to take arms into their hands at any time , and Russian passports gave them the right to enter freely the territory of our country .
Thus , Bondarev noted , in Syria , Russia is fighting international terrorism on the distant borders - otherwise this evil would " bounce to us . "

Syria accuses the United States of supporting terrorism
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem accused the United States and its partners of war crimes in Syria and supporting terrorism .
The [ Western ] coalition completely destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqah , destroyed infrastructure and public services in the areas targeted , and committed massacres of civilians , including children and women .
These killings are war crimes under international law , " he said .
According to Muallem , the US and its partners provided " direct support to the terrorists " , as the targets of the militants and the Western coalition in Syria coincided and implied " the sowing of chaos , death and destruction on their way . "
The Foreign Minister also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria is almost complete , and the country has become more secure and stable .
Muallem added that Damascus also intends to clear Syria from illegal foreign presence , and priority in the reconstruction of the country will be given to Syrian partners .

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko believes that while respecting the sovereignty of other states , Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty .
The head of state said this during his visit to Kharkiv Oblast commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports in Transcarpathia .
By protecting Ukrainian citizens , I defend the sovereignty of our state .
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other states , we demand the same respect for Ukraine , ” stressed Poroshenko .
According to Poroshenko , he as president will protect Ukrainian citizens , wherever they are - in the east or in the west of the country .
At the same time , the head of state supported the position of the Foreign Ministry in the passport scandal with Hungary , which consists in the intention to expel the consul of that country from Beregovo .
“ I fully share every letter that the Foreign Ministry said , ” the President noted .
As reported by " FACTS " , on September 19 in the network appeared a video , which recorded the moment of issuance of Hungarian passports to citizens of Ukraine at the Consulate of Hungary in Beregovo .
At the same time , they aloud swore the oath of allegiance to Hungary .
Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Pavel Klimkin noted that the Hungarian Consul , who appears on the video with the distribution of Hungarian passports to Ukrainians , must leave the territory of Ukraine either by the decision of Budapest itself or will be sent by Kiev .

More than 10 million Syrians have become refugees since the beginning of the armed conflict that has been going on in Syria for seven years .
Some five million people fled to other countries , particularly neighbouring Turkey , Lebanon and Jordan .
Now , according to Damascus , the war is coming to an end , and the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees .
Syria ’ s foreign minister , Walid al-Muallem , said at the UN : “ The situation on the ground has now become more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism .
The Government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by the terrorists , returning them to normal life .
All conditions have been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to a country that they have been forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions that have made lives difficult and have deprived them of their means of subsistence .
The Syrian authorities have also called on the international community to facilitate the return of refugees and to provide funds for that purpose .
Meanwhile , the US and EU countries refuse to provide assistance to Syria , saying that a political solution to the conflict must first be found .

" Volkswagen " fully admitted his guilt in " dieselge " in January 2017 .
In December last year , Oliver Schmidt , one of the managers of the American division of the company , was sentenced to seven years in prison .
The Group ’ s losses are estimated at at least 25 billion euros .
This amount includes not only fines and compensation .

In February , the company ’ s management stated that the obligations have already been fulfilled for 83 % of vehicles , so the program will be completed ahead of schedule .

Thus , the management of the company has changed recently , as well as announced large-scale restructuring and fundamental changes in the management system .
Moreover , Volkswagen promises to buy even new cars if German cities ban diesel on their streets : the authorities got this right in February this year .

Metropolitan Hilarion compared the decision of Kiev to rename UOC with the actions of the fascists
Metropolitan Hilarion , Head of the Synodal Department of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church , compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate into the Russian Church in Ukraine to the actions of the fascists against Jews .
" It 's like pointing a yellow pointed star in fascist Germany to a Jew , it means marking the Church as an enemy organization , and it is for this purpose that this bill was created , " said the Metropolitan on the TV channel " Russia-24 " ( quote on " Interfax " ) .
In his opinion , this step will have the most serious consequences right now , when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is in an acute stage .
Kyiv thus hopes to gain full control over the UOC and " outlaw it " , the priest believes .
" It is a Ukrainian church , and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians , they are patriots of their country , " he added .
Earlier it became known that deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on the implementation of bills Nos. <unk> ( on change of subordination of religious communities ) , <unk> ( on special status of religious organizations ) and <unk> ( on change of name of religious organizations ) .
The latter implies renaming the UOC of the Moscow Patriarchate .
When the plan appeared , it was surprisingly simple and straightforward .

Deputy of the Pochaev Lavra called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian holy sites
Metropolitan Vladimir , deputy of St. Uspenskaya Lavra of Pochaev , made a call to protect the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian holy sites .
The text of his appeal to the faithful of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church ( UOC ) was published on Saturday on the site of the monastery .
In different times of history , our predecessors and our family members , in faith and spirit , had to confess their faith and defend their holy places .
Taking into account the situation that has developed , and according to the information we have , and on the threats of massacres that are spreading , it is clear that we will have to survive , " said the Metropolitan .
He asked for support - prayer , moral .
Also the deputy of the Lavra stressed that it is likely " will need your physical presence " .
The minister added : “ Lenin ’ s grandchildren , in spirit , are threatened with death , and therefore we will defend our holy place . ”
Who is not indifferent to the fate of Pochaev Lavra - Orthodox Ukrainian and world holy , it is necessary to be ready to protect it , the address says .
The Metropolitan urged not to follow the example of those who mislead believers .
The UOC has a canonical status defined by Tomos of October 29 , 1990 from the Mother of the Church .
And now someone wants to make dependent on the newly-stylish patriarch and friend of the Catholic Pope Bartholomew .
The new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us Orthodox .
And we are happy with the status that our church has , " the governor of the Lavra said .
He recalled that the UOC had been canonically independent and fully independent in its administration since October 1990 .
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate .
Actually Tomos our church already has .
What else do we need Tomos ? " said Metropolitan Vladimir of Pochaev , urging believers and all citizens to ask whether other denominations have Tomos , are they independent from the Vatican ?
Believers to some extent understood and defined what temple to them to go to .
However , someone wants to sow enmity and strife again .
Some are envied by envy that the domes shine on the temples that they want to destroy , " said the priest .
Pochaev Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine .
The Lavra is located on the top of the Pochaev mountain , 70 kilometers from Ternopil .
The first historical information about it dates back to the beginning of the XIII century .
In fact , Western cuisine is pretentious ... and such is .

The main Macedonian oppositionist refused to vote in the referendum
In Macedonia , on Sunday , September 30 , a referendum is being held on an intergovernmental treaty with Greece on renaming the Republic of Macedonia .
Citizens are asked to answer one question : " Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic ? "
However , Christian Mickowski , leader of the leading opposition party , the Inner Macedonian Revolutionary Organization , the Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity ( VMRO-DPMNE ) , said that he would not vote in the referendum .
As the party ’ s spokesman Naum Stoilkovsky explained , Mickoski decided to abstain from voting in order to express his disagreement with the treaty , which considers " harmful " .
According to the spokesperson , the current referendum will decide on renaming the country and not more , while the strategic goal of the party is to achieve membership in NATO and the EU .
A week ago , Macedonian President Gheorghe Ivanov refused to participate in the referendum on September 30 .
He explained that the name for the country he chose 27 years ago in the referendum on independence . The Macedonian leader considers renaming the country a negative factor .
“ A new semi-sovereign state with a new name is being created , ” said Ivanov .
The agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , the Republic of Northern Macedonia , was signed by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Macedonia and Greece on 17 June this year during a solemn ceremony on the shore of the Prespa Lake , which is the border between the two countries .
This treaty should resolve the long-standing dispute over the name of the country , as well as Skopje ’ s way to NATO and the EU , reminiscent of TASS .

The United States is pleased with the growth of opiate production in Afghanistan
On September 26 , much was said about the sharp aggravation of the situation in Afghanistan in Tehran .
There were multilateral consultations with Iran , India , China , Afghanistan and Russia , represented by Secretary of the Security Council Nikolay Patrushev .
In fact , on Afghan territory , militants unleashed a real terrorist war against the State authorities and the civilian population of the country .
This year has been a record year in terms of the number of bloody terrorist attacks that killed thousands of ordinary Afghans , ” Patrushev said .
The ills of Afghanistan did not begin yesterday .
After the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the main enemy of the United States was declared the terrorist group " Al-Qaida " ( banned in the Russian Federation ) , which settled in Afghanistan .
Within a month , America and NATO allies launched a military operation called Enduring Freedom .
17 years have passed .
Thousands of American troops are still on Afghan soil .
And peaceful life is even more ghosts than then .
American troops were driven out of dozens of their bases .
As they can , they buy back from the militants for money - only if they were not touched .
The government of Afghanistan controls a smaller part of the country - 40 % , according to Patrushev .
50 % of the Taliban ( prohibited in the Russian Federation ) .
Another 10 % - for ISIS terrorists ( banned in the Russian Federation ) .
But they are growing fast there .
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia - exactly what they did not do in Iraq and Syria .
America seems to be happy with it .
It is also gratifying that the production of drugs ( opiates ) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times over the 17 years of the United States presence .
The huge growth of areas sown with opium poppy and multibillion profits .

Macedonians are preparing to vote in the referendum on joining the EU and NATO , subject to the change of name of the country .
The agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia into the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on 17 June as a result of long negotiations with neighbouring Greece , which refused to recognize the right of its northern neighbour to be called Macedonia , seeing in such a name the attempt on the Greek province and Greek history of the same name .
Lyupko Petkovski , political scientist : " Through this agreement Macedonia or Northern Macedonia is entitled to a better future , hope for social change .
And Greece will consolidate the right to its past .
There are no perfect agreements .
They are the result of difficult compromises that cannot make everyone happy . "
The renaming of the country is supported by the ruling Social Democrats , led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev .
Against is the conservative opposition and the president of the country George Ivanov .
According to journalist Tsvetin Chilimanov , Macedonia does not make sense to join the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with it : " Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the present socialist government headed by Zaev is imposed from outside in order to change the name of the country .
But this decision will have negative consequences .
First of all , the loss of sovereignty .
It is obvious that there are countries that do not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans . "
Fei Dulgheri , Euronews : " The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is facing the biggest challenge in its history .
The country was at a crossroads .
The choice that Macedonian citizens will make will determine the future not only of the Balkans , but also of Europe as a whole . "
