A nice push called "moskovskiy language Ukrainian product."
Ukrainian children's writer and wrestler for the purity of the native language Larisa Nitsa called to oust from Ukraine "the Russian-speaking Moscow product and the language."
It offers a Ukrainian product - "cultural wave, cultural onslaught."
Nitsa shared her thoughts on the "expediency of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine" with the Ukrainian publication "Observatory."
According to her, the corresponding Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it even already exists and continues to develop further.
Over time Ukrainians will "recover" from this "Moscow language," she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, according to her, earlier on television and radio widely used Russian speech, but in the public space it practically remained.
At the same time, according to Nice, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, are only "an extension of the borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level."
Earlier, Nice shared her experience of maintaining the "Ukrainian-language regime" in the children's camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the Watsons bookstore chain, the cashier of one of which communicated with her in Russian.

Kosachev: at the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly the topic of Russia in a negative way was practically absent
The head of the Committee of the Federation Council on International Affairs Konstantin Kosachev considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly successful for Russia and does not rule out that it will become a turning point in the perception of Russia as an integral participant in solving global world problems.
"The uniqueness of this 73rd session, in my opinion, lies in the fact that the rhetoric to which we have almost become accustomed in recent years with regard to Russia, has now been in order more muted," - said the senator in an interview published on Sunday "Russian newspaper."
He explained that in previous years the Russian Federation was sometimes "identified as one of the three main threats to humanity, then along with Ebola fever, then along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this row, in any case, in the statement of a group of Western countries, which on this score there was expressed quite unanimously."
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed, "the topic of Russia in a negative way was practically absent."
"If we look carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Germany, I now do not take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, the choir was not entirely accurate," - the politician drew attention, noting that Russia "was no longer a certain wall, which are trained blows tennis ball."
The head of the relevant committee of the Federation Council does not rule out that this indicates a trend that, in his opinion, "will allocate the current session of the UN General Assembly], although fully this trend may manifest in a year, two, three."
"I do not rule out that the current session in some sense can be a turning point," Kosachev admitted, explaining that "too many examples of how Russia can move forward in international affairs."
As an example, he cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
So far, unfortunately, "as long as it is not Ukraine, but I do not doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time," added the MP.

"I would not like to be wrong, but I have a feeling that we glsomewhere going through the point, for which the movement will no longer flow all five, it will be a movement forward," he added.
Another "interesting and important feeling" in this context, Kosachev called "a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop."
"I attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] of Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I saw with great pleasure that if another year or two or five years ago the Russian opinion, the Russian vision of what is happening in the world, by and large, no one was interested, but now the situation is different," - said the Chairman of the Committee of the.
In his opinion, this is due to the fact that "the so-called new liberal order, which represents the West, has no answers to the questions how to solve the world problems due to the obvious lack of ideas in the global space, lack of ideas about how to solve the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the problems of migration."
"And here the request for a Russian vision becomes more and more obvious," Kosachev expressed confidence, stressing that he considers in this sense "the current session is successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia."

AdG became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" beats another record of popularity, and Angela Merkel's ratings fall.
German residents seem to have started to become seriously tired of Angela Merkel's immigration policy, which has made the country a desirable target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
The most obvious is the latest polls, according to which the anti-immigrant party Alternative for Germany is becoming more and more popular, and the positions of the ruling bloc Merkel and Zeehofer are weakening.
This week, the AfD has broken another record, rising to the second place in the ranking of popular sympathy.
Right-wing conservatives with 17 percent of popularity managed to circumvent the Social Democrats, who have about 16 percent.
The gap in one percentage point can be written down to a statistical error, but at the same time it should be noted that the, created in 2013 from a small group of economists-Euroskeptics managed to turn into a serious political force.
Leadership in the overall standings continues to hold the ruling block of the CCC / CDU, which has about 30 percent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points - back in April, the support of the block Angela Merkel was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German Chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also.
Today, 48 per cent of Germans support Angela Merkel, 7 per cent lower than last year.
Let us add that the Social Democrats were followed by the "green" (15%), left (11%) and liberals (10%).
The evolution of the "Alternatives"
The Alternative for Germany party was established in September 2012 on the basis of the Alternative Choice 2013 group of ", which included people from the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially stood in opposition to the government course, but at first was dealt only with economic issues, including the euro problems and cooperation within the EU.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany's "sponsorship" of weak EU economies, and did not rule out the possibility of a return to the German brand and the country's complete withdrawal from the European Union the EU.
Against the background of the deepening of the immigration crisis, the political platform has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full-fledged party, which took the niche of Euroskeptics and began harshly criticize the government for the failure of immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the AdG managed to break through for the first time in the Bundestag, having received 94 deputy seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of Alternative for Germany get a seat in the European Parliament.

The term of death of the Universe is called
The universe there are about 140 billion years, ten times the age of the observed world, equal to about 13.8 billion years.
The study of the international team of scientists is posted in the library of electronic prepents arXiv.org and is aimed at publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, according to the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Experts came to such conclusions, observing with the help of HSC camera (Hyper Suprime-Cam) telescope Subaru for about ten million galaxies.
By tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which accounts for more than 95 percent of the energy-mass of the observed world, scientists, working within the framework of the standard cosmological model CDM (λ Cold Dark Matter), estimated the rate of expansion of the universe, which was slightly slower than previously thought.
In the press release of the Observatory Subaru noted that the observations allowed to obtain a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the Universe, and the recording of the data of the European space telescope Planck specified the restrictions imposed on the parameters of the CDM.
In July, scientists simulated the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues presented new arguments that the observed world will cease to exist after 22 billion years as a result of the Great Gap.

In the match "Loko - Akhmat" errors Turbat pas from the cornucopia
The former judge of the All-Union category Vladimir Levitin, commented on the work of the arbitrator Evgeny Turbin in the match of the 9th round of the championship of Russia's World Cup "Locomotive" - "Akhmat" and the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you assess the refereeing of Evgeny Turbin in the match "Locomotive" - "Akhmat"?
- I consider that this arbitrator confirmed the unsuitability for refereeing matches of the Russian Premier League.
I am surprised that the pressure in the meeting of the fifth round of "Spartak" - "Dynamo," neither Turbin himself, nor the leaders of the DSI made serious conclusions about his low qualification.
The result did not slow down in the ninth round: errors in his actions, private passes of rough receptions fell as from the horns of abundance.
For example, at the 50th minute of the railwayman Eder fills up with hands in his penalty area defender Ahmat "Rodolfo.
From the gate eight meters, but Turbin does not put a penalty.
How do you assess epzod involving Idov, who was on the 82nd minute, when it seemed that the ball hit him in the hand?
"I think that there was a deliberate hand game defender in the penalty area.
The turbines was close to a good fashion sees this episode and his first assistant slaw.
This moment was to see and reserve judge Sergey Karasev.
However, all three slept and the penalty was not assigned.
Therefore the score in a match is distorted, and sports justice was broken.
It was the same case when refereeing by concepts displaced and buried the sports spirit of the game.
- On the 52nd minute Turbin didn't did not dare to remove the defender of guests Oleg Ivanov, who violated the rules in the fight against Krykhovyak, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, demonstratively applauded him.
What do you think about this episode?
It was necessary to show the second "mustard"?
- In this moment Turbin and the first yellow card showed not quite the.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about double standards of refereeing that some teams put penalties for such violations as in the episode with Idov, and some not.
What do you think?
- Looking what to understand under double standards.
There was a penalty.
He was not given.
It means that the arbitrator does not give a second penalty in the opposite gate.
This is the principle that is used.
And the second point of double standards is that the judge looks who plays.
Here he played on Saturday "Locomotive" and "Akhmat" there is a serious claim to Turbin's work because the team was infringed.
"The man changed the floor, became a lesbian. a minute.
To his great joy, his team won the game.

Matt Damon played accused of rape Judge Cavanaugh at the start of SNL
American actor Matt Damon played a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, Cavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first release of the new Saturday Night Live season on NBC.
During a small sketch, the actor played Kavanaugh at a Senate hearing on charges of rape.
A candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court has previously drawn attention to his emotionality and details of his stories during a conversation with Senator Amy Klobushar.
So, Kavanaugh repeatedly confessed his love for beer, but stated that he had never been drunk to memory.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on charges of rape, Cavanaugh stated that in those years he was a virgin.
These moments also beat Damon.
I just did that a lot of drank and didn't think about sex.
I was the most proud, the most drunken virgin whom anyone has ever seen.
Everyone knows it, "said the judge, played by Matt Damon.
Earlier, Kavanaugh was elected supreme judge of the United States.
But pay attention to the face and body language of everyone who is present on this odd picture, and you will feel that they are all playing.
But my advice to you is to tell them that you have behaved badly and fled, and apologize.

The US was thinking about Russia's naval blockade due to the oil and gas supply
In the US may begin naval blockade of Russia in order to gain an advantage on the global market of energy.
The American authorities are so zealous in the struggle for success in the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to the naval blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world's leading suppliers of energy.
U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke told about the possibility of the naval blockade the day before.
Contrary to world practice, the U.S. Department of the Interior does not perform police functions, but civilian functions, including implementing policy in the field of natural resources.
Therefore, Zinke's statement came within the competence of his department, and was not devoid of political color.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that thanks to the U.S. Naval forces control the sea routes in the Middle East region and can block them if necessary.
According to The words of Zinke followed that the need may be related to Washington's desire to prevent Russian supplies to the world energy market.
Zinke reminded that Russia still receives the lion's share of its revenues from oil and gas supplies to the world market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motive for Moscow's activation in this region, Zinke said.
The Minister made it clear that the U.S. still expects to secure leadership in the world energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do this, Washington will have to push Russia and Iran, and the naval blockade of trade routes - an acceptable measure on this path, Zinke believes.

- How is it right?
Words to pressure does not exist.
The right thing is to catch up.
The word "give" in the meaning "pull, influence, impact" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "."
We use this word, believing that it comes from the word "pressure."
But the "pressure" and "reach" etymologically not only not close, but even in some sense are opposite.
See for yourself.
To (church-book, outdated) means "enough, full, enough, to be sufficient for someone or something to satisfy."
Satisfaction, pleasure - related words.
In the past, he still had the meaning "not to depend on anything, to have a self-fulfilling meaning" - "to win."
The old Slavonic "" is related to the words "" and "will."
Press, suppress - absolutely different.
These words are truly frightening "relatives": DAOS - "wolf" (pressurizing sheep), deyja - "die" and "push."
The similar phonetic appearance of the words "pressure" and "catch up," as well as the imminent obsolescence of the latter, forced them to enter into the.
So we have this very "d [a] draw," which is also used on the letter through "a," which, in a good way, is wrong and impossible in terms of the processes the emergence and development of these words.
So, the right to live.
But this word is outdated, in its correct meaning no longer used.
