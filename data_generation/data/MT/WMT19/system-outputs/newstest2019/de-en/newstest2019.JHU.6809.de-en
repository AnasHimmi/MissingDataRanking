DFB boss Grindel sees no basis for Özil's comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil's return to the national team.
"This is a question that depends, of course, on the fact that you get into a conversation, that you also talk to him about why he apparently felt one or the other of these things, as stated in his statement," Grindel said in the soccer podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the "Bild-Zeitung."
Despite months of debate over Özil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92-times national player Özil.
"I would have been delighted if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I've also assumed at some point that this would be the case, "Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and justified it on the grounds that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The head of the DFB repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build pressure, but he knows from football that when "you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it's a shame that this conversation hasn't come about so far."

Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and good-looking: Florian David Fitz.
You've got to look at it twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and had a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht," produced by the NDR, is known for cheerful conversations at the bar of the Hamburg harbour pub "Schellfischposten."
Presenter Ina Müller and her guests come up with some beer, some wine or even more high-percentage drinks to relax the mood and tongues.
Quite a few celebrities also drink courage for the obligatory singing inserts.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time, the actor Florian David Fitz is known for films such as "Men's Hearts," "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Most Horny Day."
But the trip to the far north didn't get a good deal for Munich.
On Saturday, he posted a SELFIE - his face is completely scratched on it, his eyes just two small slits.
The bed SELFIE shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he is not ill, he only has a mighty hangover.
Addressing his fans, he posted some - probably not quite serious - insights that he has now gained: "Rule one: NIE is going to Ina's night.
Rule two: Never drink the black sow.
And Spritz.
And the round of egg liqueur, which Ina casts at half past three, is also letting go.
Alcohol consumption is truly written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans poured in a few tips to fight back.
They ranged from instant broth, fish rolls or - probably the most purposeful - headache tablets.
Others were simply amused by the sight of the normally attractive movie star.
It is not yet known how Ina Müller survived the nocturnal blaze.
However, as she has been moderating the TV fun at the bar since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tried and tested...

Decision to return from ethnological museum to Native People in Alaska
The Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation (SPK) will return nine objects from the collection of the ethnological Museum of the State Museums of Berlin to the Chugach Alaska Corporation.
The Board of Trustees has today approved a proposal from the President to this effect.
The objects are gravestones of Native People from southwest Alaska.
They were among the objects brought to Berlin by Johan Adrian Jacobsen, who travelled the American north-west coast and Alaska between 1882 and 1884 on behalf of the then Royal Museum of Ethnology (now the Ethnological Museum).
Hermann Parzinger, president of the SPK, said:
"At the time, the objects were taken from the graves of their deceased without the consent of the Native People and thus unlawfully, so they do not belong in our museums."
"We will now return you to the Chugach Alaska Corporation, with which we have been working since 2015 on the refurbishment of our collection."
In the future, the reconstituted objects will be presented in the Chugach community, among others within the framework of the annual Chugach Spirit Camp, which serves the exchange of knowledge between the generations and the various tribes that now belong to the Chugach.
As part of John Johnson's current visit to Berlin, a memorandum of understanding with the ethnological museum has also been prepared.
The objects are tombstones from Chenega Island and the now unknown town of Sanradna in Kachemak Bay.
Among them are two broken masks and a children's coat, as well as a wooden idol.
After use, masks were mostly burned or placed in graves, which is why today there are no longer many masks of the Chugach.
The red colour on them refers to the funeral context.
The wooden idol is probably a shamanic figure designed to protect people from danger and death.
In total, the ethnological museum owns just over 200 Chugach objects.
The Chugach region in southwest Alaska has been home to people known as Sugpiaq or Alutiiq for several thousand years, and was formerly known as the Pacific Eskimos.
About 1,000 to 1,500 years ago, athabastic-speaking Indian groups, today's Dena'ina (formerly known as Tanaina), also emigrated.
Today, the Alaskan natives, who call themselves Chugach, live around the Prince William Sound and Cook Inlet.
They live in seven communities: Chenega, Eyak, Nanwalek, Port Graham, Seward, Tatilek and Valdez.
There have been regular contacts with Europe since the time of the Tsar Peter the Great.
In November 2015, a delegation from the Chugach Alaska Corporation visited the ethnological museum, with the aim of initiating cooperation for future projects.
The background was, among other things, the interest in creating a virtual collection of all Chugach objects around the world.
The corporation then asked the ethnological museum for help in returning any burial sites in the region.
The Chugach Alaska Corporation (www.chugach-ak.com) is an advocacy group of the Native People of the Chugach region in Alaska, which has been in existence since 1972.
Among other things, it is committed to preserving the cultural heritage of these groups.
The US government supported the request for restitution by means of a diplomatic note.
In line with its basic approach to dealing with its non-European collections and research into provenances, the SPK carefully examined the context from which the burial materials, which are located in the ethnological museum, originate.
In the present case, all indications are that the objects originate from a burial plot and not from an approved archaeological excavation.
From Adrian Jacobsen's travel books, it is clear that the tombs were only opened for the purpose of extracting their contents.
There were no official or state approvals for this, nor was the consent of the community of origin documented.
Against this background, the decision to return was made.
At the end of the 19th century, Johan Adrian Jacobsen travelled to the American Northwest Coast and Alaska for the Berlin Museum of Ethnology.
The director of the museum, Adolf Bastian, had commissioned him, for the purpose of building a collection, to collect items that were as "original" as possible, unaffected by European culture.
Jacobsen brought around 3,000 objects from the northwest coast and around 4,000 objects from Alaska to Berlin.
His report on the trip is an impressive document of the times.

Treysa has struggled with vandalism and rubbish
The entrance to the 36-kilometre-long track in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is hard to find and tidy.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are hardly emerging.
Shards, cigarette tips, rubbish and rubbish, demolished dustbin and now dismantled signs - this is how the entrance to the bike path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the flagship railway bike trail in the Rotkäppchenland, a more than unfathomable sight.
The topic has been occupied by members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also by others for a long time, according to the city's cycling commissioner, Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been raised in the cycling advisory board.
So far, there has been no solution.
The proposals ranged from the laying of the seating group to the regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also introduced the topic to the local council.
It's not just the rubbish that drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting place to celebrate on weekends.
Not only is it often noisy, but the joints are also destroyed: Posts are torn out of the ground, dustbin is demolished, signs are bent over, seating furniture is lubricated.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions, however, are only the proverbial drop in the ocean.
They are annoyed that the resting place on the bike trail in Treysa is a meeting place for scattering.
"Along the entire cycle path, the focus here is clearly on the Haaße hill," confirms the cycling commissioner, who is now also concerned about the new cycling site in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "It may well raise the threshold for attacking the common good.
However, this would presuppose that a police riot would then pass by in a timely manner.
As a matter of principle, Wüstenhagen wants the Haaße hill to develop.
It needs to be made more attractive.
In fact, one can be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle path so far.
The tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany, "said the ADFC members.

Music contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Go of Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in cooperation.
"D to offer a song for Hiltrup," is the appeal of the Hiltrup district offensive, in the "Music contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians."
A contest "with eyebrows in the sympathetic Hiltruper family," as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family affair with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-time Albachtener living in Hiltrup, the Nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben," three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland.
This contest, said district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We haven't seen that in other parts of the city yet.
What did the lyrics look like?
The Hiltruper lake and the Marktallee were particularly frequently mentioned in the localities.
In his hit song, Rolf Ihmig chose the avenue as "Hiltrup's birthplace."
The cultural railway station has also been recognised.
Time and again, it was a matter of living together in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke animated the short renovation breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about their work.
Humberg was told that he had actually studied chemistry, but now he is also teaching guitar.
Franke was informed by sound technician Stefan Schemmelmann that he recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the programme.
And Alvin Jasic, meanwhile, has put a lot on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from Hiltruper gastronomy.
However, there was something special for the jury's favourites - so that others could listen to their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied will be able to record an entire CD with sound technician Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup-Schlager, who particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "A very nice performance" with ten children and two teachers on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like all of them, the children performed again at the finale - and sounded "really good," as Franke said, even without electronic support.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, responsiveness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Business Association, as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive launched the event on the occasion of its tenth anniversary.

The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each side, there is a screen, in it four cards with keywords, which - the old trick with the red foil - can only be deciphered once you have put them in.
This ensures that the opposite side will not be able to read anything by mistake.
On the maps, for example, you can read from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
2. Window.
3. Cubes.
4. Feast. "
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
For it is not the terms that are to be guessed here, but codes.
Alternately, one player per team is the encrypter.
He gets a code card that says "3.4.2."
In "Decrypto," it is not the terms behind the secret foil that are to be guessed, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "dice," "festival" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not, as far as possible; because that wins the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
So the encrypter notes and reads out loud: "Throw" for the cubes, "lots" as a contrast to festival; here, of course, something like "party" and "Prague" would be possible, because he watched at school and knows the windows there.
That's how it goes round by round, team by team.
One does not know the terms of the opposite side - but it can be better combined with every hint that the encrypter gives there.
The transcripts should be as mysterious as possible, but not too twisted, otherwise it will be unnecessarily difficult for his team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rule book.
The players will probably have to study it for quite a long time and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanatory video at decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.

The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes Evergreens from the 1920s to the 1960s.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
Heide Keller became a star on the "dream ship."
Now she is talking openly about the fact that the series may have been complicit in her marriage to Hans von Borsody.
Her role as Ledebur's chief hostess, Beatrice, on the "dream ship," made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018, she went on board forever.
The series that made her a star could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she had been married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason, too.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world alone with a suitcase, and many of my admired colleagues noticed me at eye level, "Keller said in an interview with" Bild am Sonntag. "
At first, she was always "the wife of Hans von Borsody," but that changed with the "dream ship."
For now, the journalists only appealed to Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it so much."
She thinks it's possible that her husband at the time might have been jealous, but "like many men, Hans was scared of talking about problems and feelings."
Keller has always tried to be the only right person for Hans von Borsody, and he didn't want to get to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I've changed my mind, "she explains.
She always felt she was "not good enough for him.
He saw me as an emancipated woman who I had never really been, even though I sometimes seemed cheeky and brave on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever. "
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "although I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time."
The day before the official wedding, I sat in the wardrobe and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why did it never work out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller imagined love at the time, "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I'm far too naive about love. '

Elon Musk, founder of electric car maker Tesla, has escaped his impending dismissal as head of the billionaire firm.

He is allowed to remain on the board of directors.
In the settlement, which has yet to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted wrongdoing.

Football: District League: Researcher VfL Wolbeck's performance against SC Altenrheine is encouraging
There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch went hard on the court with his own.
He gave himself up, the coach of the football district league VfL Wolbeck, only once (inwardly) withdrew in order to reflect on the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
All history.
In the meantime, it is running around the Brandhoveweg again.
Taufrischer proof is the 1: 1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine, in the last season only scratched by the climb.
Yes, I'm very happy with the performance.
'We've tightened the spaces and put pressure on the ball.
That could be seen, "Fetsch praised his guys and went to each and every one of them for the game, simply to say" thank you "for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury to Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - Luca Rehberg came for him - the 4-4-2 went almost seamlessly over into a 4-2-3-1 in which Niklas Thewes waited in front for balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more games in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs in front of him (17th), the alternate Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
It almost smiled when, in minute 41, the SCA struck twice in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer dangerously in front of the Wolbeck box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the champion of his field.
After the break, the VfL mistakenly took full control.
Thewes, from 18 metres, narrowly failed.
Schroer, too, came too late after 58 minutes in a Thewes innings.
With the addition of Miles Geske, Fetsch once again missed a fresh cell cure on the left side.
When Altenrheiner's Chris Naberbäumer slammed Robin Westhues in the 70th minute, there was an indirect free-kick for the Platzherren 18 metres in front of the guest house.
The gunman himself stepped in and demonstrated his dangerousness in terms of standards.
Westhues "Thing with the right slap hit the bottom left from the shooter's point of view - 1: 0 (71.).
20 minutes to go, which should be damn long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck unhappily flew the leather in the penalty area in the 80th minute.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider didn't miss the gift (79).
Wolbeck had to endure a difficult few minutes in the closing stages before Geske still had the winner on the puck in the 87th minute from 12 metres.
Might have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Manchester United lose again, we're uncomfortable for Mourinho
After a blistering run in the league, Manchester United are now losing in the seventh round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United, Manu is 1: 3. The manner of the defeat is likely to give way to talk.
The scene was emblematic in the 74th minute, in which the reigning Marko Arnautovic scored 3-1 for West Ham, just three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all of Manchester's defensive players stood still, leaving Arnautovic all the time to pass the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
It was the negative climax of what had previously been a long stretch of insufficient performance.
At the moment, the mood at Uniteds city rivals Manchester City is very different.

However, fans of the Gunners, who played through Granit Xhaka, had to wait until the 81st minute for a victory against the Hertfordshire County surprise team.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart unhappily booked Alex Iwobi into his own goal, and just two minutes later Mesut Özil made the decision with his third goal of the season.
Arsenal moved past Watford thanks to their fifth consecutive win and are now just behind big rivals Tottenham in fifth place, leaving a strong impression on rising Wolverhampton under their Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.

1: 4 vs. Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season bust: "Scary situation"
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter assembled his disappointed pros from Hannover 96 and gave them courage.
However, there was not much positive to see beforehand in the 1: 4 (0: 2) final of the table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a scary situation, but you have to get out of there as a team," said 96-football professional Pirmin Schwegler, and he shouted: "That's disappointing, of course, because you always have a lot to do."
The further victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) came to a close, stand at the bottom with two counters and are, in their current constitution, a candidate for relegation.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt, on the other hand, celebrated their first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored the goals in front of 46,300 spectators for the DFB Cup winner, who, after a successful rehearsal for the Europa League match against Lazio Rome, had seven points in the middle of the table.
Croatia's vice-world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action by the Hessen on his starting debut and was never able to get a grip on Hanover's defence.
The striker, who has struggled for a long time after the World Cup, showed with his speed and perseverance why he is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, who was lent by Liverpool FC, also stood for the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurter, which began in a vibrant manner.
A head ball from Lucas Torró (17th), which was fake on the goal net, brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller, in a promising position at the last minute, was stopped by the 96 defence around Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-handed Kevin Wimmer (back).
The lead for the hosts was almost inevitable and fully deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a deflected corner, Haller extending head-to-head in front of the goal, where Ndicka only needed to keep his foot on.
It was the first Bundesligatreffer for the defender, who came in the summer from the French second division player AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt moved on before the break.
This time, Haller adapted to his storm partner Rebic, who skillfully got through and left 96-goalkeeper Michael Esser with no chance.
At half-time, Hannover coach Breitenreiter reacted to the poor performance of his Elf and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt, two new offensive players.
The Lower Saxony now played a bit more boldly forward, but igniting ideas remained until shortly before the end, when, after all, the follow-up hit was still successful.
The Hessen were much more efficient.
After a short hour, Rebic started a solo and then put the ball across to De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was only show running for the Frankfurter against overstretched guests, and Jovic also hit one minute before the end.
The summer itself was also unusually wet.

Inauguration: New residential home in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The life support company Donau-Iller is opening a new residential home for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
That "a very special house" is now being handed over to its destination in Münsterblickstraße - all those present were in agreement at the inauguration date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users, who have been living in the living room of the Danube-Iller life support centre for some time, are dependent on the special architecture of the new building.
In his concept, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger spaces and barrier-free access for all areas.
The first plans began around eight years ago, when the former US Army officer building was put to the test for residents with a mobile phone cap: "The house had come in the years and was no longer up to date with the equipment," explained Bader in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators moved in to demolish the house.
The new building should be designed to be as friendly and bright as possible, so that residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Life support Danube-Iller opens new residential home
Life support invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, while the district of Swabia contributed 450000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction works have remained within the planned framework - both in terms of time and money.
The managing director of life support, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between a barrier-free and, at the same time, fire-proof construction has not always been easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications that allow the residents to experience the freedom to move without the help of others.
The head of the social administration of the district of Swabia, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said in a similar way: "The house is geared to the special needs of its residents, who need tools to be mobile."
In doing so, the homelessness and functionality were well combined, said Kreutmayer.
He added: "The plot in this location is a real stroke of luck, because it can no longer be purchased in the current situation."
In total, the new residential home in Münsterblickstrasse offers space of almost 1500 square metres for 30 people with disabilities, who are divided into three residential groups.
Life support manager Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed on a tariff basis.

Barcelona - On the eve of the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on October 1, 2017, clashes between separatists and police broke out in the center of Barcelona.

Around 3,000 officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wanted to use a rally to pay tribute to their colleagues who were deployed in the polling stations last year in what was considered an illegal referendum.

Catalan police have formed a chain to keep the separatist and central state security forces' demonstrations separate, Spanish media reported.
However, some of the 6,000 or so separatists would have attempted to break through the police chain by force, throwing paint bags and eggs at the officers, among other things.

It didn't work - nothing.
The Ahlens did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
It wasn't until the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but it didn't make any difference either.
Angelo Daut then tried to highlight the positive: "I like the fact that we played to zero." But unfortunately, the zero also stood at the front.
"This time we were not as dangerous as we were against Holzwickede, even though our opponent didn't want to play here," said RW Ahlen's interim coach.
Offensively, "it all sounded like a bit" against a team "that just wanted to defend.

Lubricants with local political message: No successful advertisement for skateboarding
In Lengerich, unknown people have advertised for the construction of a skate system in a way that is hardly helpful.
There are corresponding lubricants in several places, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, criminal charges have been filed with the police for damage to property.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" Are emblazoned on signs at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall, among others.

Since the short message was apparently left "only" with an edding at the time, it could have been removed without any problems.
"A few days later, however, it was back, this time sprayed," Rottmann said.
He assumes that the corresponding advertisement will have to be replaced.
A special note is given to this particular case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.

Promises have already been made, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department of schools, sport and culture, without naming names.

Air traffic control bottleneck gets worse
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"We've had wind this year, we're going to have strong winds in 2019 and then the storm comes," Matthias Maas, head of the air traffic control union, told the German Press Agency ahead of the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight cancellations is the long-known shortage of staff in European air traffic control systems, for which there is no quick solution.

Traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 have been far too low.
The resulting cost targets and staff savings for national air traffic control systems are now fully reflected in the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to push for regulations in Brussels that "do not further cut off the air" for air traffic controllers.
At the moment, the EU's requirements would be agreed by 2024, and there are fears of further tightening.

He said he hoped the high cost of delays for airlines would lead to a rethink.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German air traffic control agency (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future pact," Maas said.
The so far announced admission of 120 pilots per year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for age-related departures.

Public procurement of construction services and anti-corruption measures
Joint report by the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel examinations
Introduction and overview
The awarding of services by contracting authorities is of great importance to both the state and the economy.
The task of the state is to use the public funds as economically and economically as possible, as well as to ensure fair and regulated competition.
In the European Union (EU), the award of services by contracting authorities is an important part of the creation of a single economic area.
In order to be able to guarantee largely unlimited competition across borders, the contracting authorities have to comply with EU requirements when awarding contracts from certain value limits (thresholds).
To this end, the EU member states have to transfer and apply the EU's public procurement law into national law.
This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.
Under the EU thresholds, it is up to individual countries to regulate the award of public contracts themselves.
The awarding of services is also an area at risk of corruption.
Due to the fundamentally high potential for damage, the contracting authorities must therefore take appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and undue privileges in the awarding of their contracts.
In January 2011, the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed to carry out parallel audits both for the award of construction services across the EU and for the prevention of corruption.
The main focus of the examinations was the application of the EU public procurement law, which has been transposed into national regulations, as well as the prevention of corruption in the awarding of construction services in civil engineering, road construction and transport infrastructure.
The awards below the EU thresholds have also been included in the considerations with regard to the prevention of corruption.
The audit results of both audit bodies are summarised in the present joint report.
The report will also be addressed to international bodies, such as the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).
Examination areas and verified bodies The evaluations of the Federal Court of Auditors on the topics listed are mainly based on cross-sectional examinations carried out in 2011 / 2012 by the building authorities responsible for the road and construction of the federal government in Germany.
In doing so, he examined, for example, the construction of motorways and large-scale construction projects.
In addition, the Federal Court of Auditors drew on results from previous investigations.
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic based its evaluations on audit findings from 2008 to 2011, which included construction measures in road, rail, water, construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.) and other areas of construction in the Czech Republic.
The awarding of federal public contracts in Germany is predominantly carried out by the building authorities of the federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the state building administration is centrally responsible for the distribution of transport infrastructure.
In the construction sector, the contracts are carried out decentrally by those bodies that use state budgets.
In both countries, freelancers will also be involved for parts of the procurement process.
When comparing the evaluations, differences in public procurement law and the market structure for construction services in both countries have to be taken into account.
Development of public procurement law in both countries
In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide procurement procedures is laid down in laws and regulations.
Procurement procedures limited to the national sector are governed by budgetary law and the administrative provisions that are based on it.
In addition, for both EU-wide and national contracts,
Such as the so-called "award books" of the federal government, in which the legal requirements are supplemented or formulated in more detail, in accordance with the public procurement law.
In the Czech Republic, the award procedure is governed exclusively by the Procurement Act and other legal provisions, which apply both to the area above and below the EU thresholds.
The public procurement law was significantly revised in 2012.
The new rules increased transparency in the use of public funds, increased competition and limited opportunities for corruption in the procurement process.
Guidelines for public procurement law in both countries
In both countries, the open procedure, the non-open procedure and the negotiation procedure are to be applied to EU-wide contracts in particular.
In Germany, the measures below the EU threshold are to be applied to the national types of procurement (public tender, limited tender, voluntary award), which, however, are broadly in line with the above-mentioned EU-wide types of procurement.
Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of the primacy of the open procedure (for contracts to be carried out across the EU) and the public tender (for national contracts).
In the open procedure and in the public tender process, any interested company can make an offer.
Another key feature of German public procurement law is the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises.
The main purpose of this is to divide an overall construction measure into skilled and partially unemployed people.
The individual award of these lots is intended to enable as many companies as possible to take part in the competition.
Both of the above features of German public procurement law are proven tools for achieving economic results.
In Germany, there are more than 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees.
In the Czech Republic, EU-wide procurement procedures are also to be applied to construction projects below the EU threshold.
One exception is the simplified procedure, which allows a less stringent procedure to be applied below the thresholds and under certain conditions.
Czech public procurement law, in line with EU law, provides for contracts to be concluded if competition is guaranteed and a favourable price is achieved.
The current legal regulations in the Czech Republic allow the contracting authorities to choose between the open procedure and the non-open procedure.
There are more than 85,000 construction companies in the Czech Republic, of which around 1,900 have 20 or more employees.
Construction volume of public contractors and shares of the types of contracts in both countries
In Germany, the total construction volume in 2011 was 307 billion euros.
Of this, €45.5 billion was spent on public construction (15%), which, in addition to federal construction, includes, in particular, the construction activities of the federal states and municipalities.
The federal government's construction volume in civil engineering and highway construction (excluding rail infrastructure and hydraulic engineering) amounted to 8.5 billion euros.
The volume of contracts for construction services in the federal building and highway construction sector was distributed among the types of contracts in 2011 as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public tenders, 12.7% non-open procedures and limited tenders, and 6.6% negotiation procedures and voluntary contracts.
Of these, 33.2% were Europe-wide.
The volume of public works in the Czech Republic amounted to 4.7 billion euros in 2011, which was about 25% of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.
In 2009, the volume amounted to 7.8 billion euros, equivalent to 37% of the total construction volume.
Breakdown by type of contract for 2011: 65.1% open procedures 14.3% non-public procedures 9.5% negotiated procedures 8.4% simplified procedures for contract volumes below the 2.7% threshold for other procedures
The data relate to all public contracts for deliveries, services and construction services awarded in 2011 by public procurement authorities.
The above data show that the parallel audits carried out by both countries focus on a significant proportion of public contracts, which have a major financial impact on the prevention of corruption to be observed in all contracts, and that the open procedure and the public tender are of paramount importance in the award of contracts.
Summary of the results of the parallel tests
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have carried out parallel audits in their countries for the EU-wide award of construction services and for the prevention of corruption.
In this context, the working groups of both audit bodies compared the relevant legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany, as well as the results of their parallel audits, which they carried out in particular in the areas of civil engineering and road construction.
In doing so, they essentially found:
The EU directives on the award of construction services by public authorities have been transposed into national law both in the Czech Republic and in Germany (points 1 and 3.1).
In addition to the EU requirements, corruption prevention is also served by the procurement regulations of both countries, which are partly different in terms of their focus and detail (no. 3.2).
In both countries, a key requirement for the procurement documents is that they must contain all the information needed to make an appropriate offer.
The performance descriptions must be neutral and must not be subject to competition restrictions.
In Germany, the procurement documents have largely complied with these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, it is still a problem to determine the subject of the order sufficiently.
In Germany, construction services are to be divided into lots, if possible, in order to promote competition.
According to the findings of the BRH, this requirement was largely implemented in Germany.
In its examinations, in particular in the field of road construction, the NK found that awarding large-scale services without lots or with very large lots could affect competition and lead to a restriction to only a few large companies.
Reducing the market potential can lead to significant cost increases and run the risk of price or other agreements.
According to the provisions of both countries, the contracting authorities can, under certain conditions, agree on additional or modified services with the companies already commissioned, which prove to be necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (no. 4.1).
The respective requirements for determining the type of award were largely followed in both countries.
According to the regulations of the Czech Republic, the contracting authorities are free to choose between open and non-open procedures.
In Germany, on the other hand, the legal and budgetary priority of the open procedure for EU-wide contracts or the public tender, which corresponds to the open procedure for national contracts, applies.
As a result, more companies will be able to make offers.
This reduces the risk of corruption, makes it more difficult for bidders to arrange prices and leads to the most economical results.
In the case of construction projects, whose estimated total order values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited building authorities generally awarded construction services throughout Europe.
The correct estimation of the prospective contract value is an essential basis for choosing the right type of contract.
In Germany, cost databases are used for the cost investigations of public buildings, in particular in the construction of buildings,
The construction projects that have been completed are based on the evaluations.
In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the field of road construction, but it is not yet an effective instrument (No. 4.2).
In the case of construction services to be awarded across Europe, preliminary information and announcements are to be published, which should strengthen competition by enabling interested companies to adapt to the planned contracts at an early stage.
The inspected building authorities generally adhered to this requirement.
In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or a lack of controls may have affected competition (point 4.3).
The selection of candidates to take part in non-public procurement procedures is particularly susceptible to manipulation.
Under EU law, the number of invited candidates must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not discriminate and must be disclosed beforehand.
In addition to the requirements of the EU, the contracting authorities in both countries are to switch as often as possible among the companies that are to be called upon when selecting candidates.
In order to counter the risk of manipulation, there are some very detailed guidelines in Germany.
In some cases, the audited administrations failed to take account of these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, the decisions on the selection of candidates were not always understandable (no. 4.4).
In both countries, in the interests of fair competition, it is necessary to ensure that companies interested in making an offer receive the same information during the tender period.
Contact between these companies and with freelancers involved in the creation of the service description must be prevented as far as possible in order to avoid anti-competitive agreements.
The corresponding regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.
The audited building authorities in Germany, however, did not comply with these requirements in some cases (no. 4.5).
In opening up the offers, both countries must pay particular attention to the multi-eyes principle and the principle of transparency.
The requirements for the identification, documentation, storage and confidentiality of the offers are intended to limit the scope for manipulation and are particularly detailed in Germany.
The examinations in both countries resulted in only a few complaints (no. 4.6).
In both countries, the assessment and evaluation of the offers are determined by guidelines for the organisation of construction and procedures.
The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been consistently observed by the audited contracting authorities.
For example, contracting authorities handed over offers for testing to third parties without having to look through the offers beforehand and sufficiently document the abnormalities.
As a result, the offers were insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulation (no. 4.7).
At the conclusion of the EU-wide procurement procedures, the companies participating in the competition will be informed of the intended assignment before the award of the contract.
This possibility of legal protection also has a preventive function against corrupt behaviour.
The Czech Republic also provides for the possibility of judicial review of non-EU procurement procedures.
Only in a few cases the contracting authorities did not comply with the prescribed deadlines for the orders or deviated from the bidders' offer in terms of content (no. 4.8).
The documentation of the procurement procedures was not always complete or comprehensible for the audited building authorities in both countries.
In this respect, the EU-wide transparency requirement was not sufficiently implemented in respect of the award notices of certain procedures.
Some of the identified defects also diminished the anti-corruption function of the documentation.
The contracting authorities of both countries have largely complied with their reporting and reporting obligations (No. 4.9).
The basics of EU public procurement law and corruption prevention
EU public procurement law
In order to ensure unlimited competition within the European Union with free movement of services and goods, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, among other things, the award coordination and the Remedies Directive, which had to be transposed into national law by the Member States of 8.
The general award principles of the European Union are, in particular, the requirement for competition, the requirement for equal treatment or the prohibition of discrimination, as well as the requirement for transparency.
To achieve these goals, the Procurement Coordination Directive sets out specific rules for construction works to be awarded across the EU.
In order to do so, their estimated order amounts must reach or exceed the current amount of 5,000,000 euros.
The rules concern in particular the content of the award documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, the observance of deadlines, inter alia for the receipt of the offers, the documentation of the award procedure, the requirements that can be placed on the qualification of the applicants, and the appeal directive forms the basis for the legal protection of the applicants and bidders.
In the event of possible breaches of public procurement law, affected companies can have the decisions of the contracting authorities reviewed in review proceedings.
Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the European Union's directives into national law.
Prevention of corruption
The importance of preventing corruption
In both countries, there is no legal definition of corruption.
In general, corruption is the abuse of a position of trust for private gain,
Which is usually prompted by the beneficiaries of these decisions.
Corruption can hinder competition and cause significant economic damage.
It is estimated that the global cost of corruption is 5% of global economic output.
In the area of the European Union, the amount of these costs is estimated at 1%.
In the case of contracting authorities, anti-competitive agreements or unfair behaviour can call into question confidence in the integrity and functioning of the administration.
Preventing corruption is therefore one of the fundamental tasks of public authorities.
In doing so, they will have to review the organisation of their administrations in areas that are particularly vulnerable to corruption, in order to make appropriate safeguards against corruption there.
Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly reduce the susceptibility of decision-making to corrupt abuse.
The award of public works services is generally considered to be a particularly corruption-prone area of work.
Anti-corruption measures
In Germany, corruption - in particular bribery and bribery, as well as the acceptance and approval of benefits - is prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
In order to prevent corruption, the Federal Government has issued a directive and recommendations on the prevention of corruption 12 in the Federal Administration. According to this, in addition to risk analysis, the following basic principles must be observed: Priority for public tenders and open procedures, multi-eyes principle and transparency, fundamental separation of planning, award and settlement, accuracy and complete documentation of the award procedures.
In addition, further anti-corruption provisions have been incorporated into the public procurement legislation.
In 2011, for example, the responsible Federal Ministry of Public Works introduced an electronically supported control system in the area of federal highways.
The award data - such as estimated costs and order sums - as well as information on the freelancers involved will be collected across the board and evaluated for abnormalities.
In the Czech Republic, corruption is also being prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
The legal requirements for transparency and equal treatment of tenderers, as well as the prohibition of all discrimination, form the most important basis for preventing corruption.
For public procurement, the Czech government has set out anti-corruption measures in a anti-corruption strategy paper for 2011-2012 and updated them for 2013-2014.
Some of the measures recommended in it have already been transposed into national public procurement laws and related administrative provisions.
The main provisions of the new legislation are as follows: Lowering the threshold for smaller contracts, requiring the contracting authority to disclose the contracts beforehand, including naming the reasons for the tender, prohibiting the restriction of the number of bidders in non-open procedures and thus removing the possibility of selecting bidders through locking procedures, introducing the obligation to publish the contract documents and all the annexes, introducing the obligation to publish the actual price and the list of subcontractors.

Procurement documents
Procurement documents The procurement documents must contain all the information that the bidders need to make an appropriate offer.
In particular, the procurement documents must make it possible to calculate correctly.
In so doing, bidders must not be given risks that cannot be calculated for them.
The contract documents consist, in particular, of the service description and the terms of the contract.
In addition, they contain the requirements for proving the qualification (suitability) of the bidders, as well as the criteria that determine the selection of the most economical offer.
Requirements of EU law as well as the prevention of corruption
The requirements of EU law for the procurement documents are addressed in particular to the technical specifications.
These must be equally accessible to all bidders and should limit competition as little as possible.
The service description must, in principle, be product-neutral.
For this reason, information on products or manufacturers as part of the service description is only permitted under strict conditions.
Avoiding restrictions on competition in the procurement documents is also a fundamental principle of preventing corruption.
In addition, unclear or inaccurate information in the procurement documents must be avoided, as they open up scope for speculation in the preparation of the offers and for manipulation in the evaluation of them.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Similar or similar regulations In both countries, the EU legal requirements for technical specifications have been transposed into national law.
The services are, in principle, product-neutral without the requirements of the factory.
In the performance descriptions, the individual services must, as a rule, be subdivided in detail into performance units with their respective quantities.
Prices are to be agreed on the basis of performance units (e.g. euros per square metre or per piece).
Only in exceptional cases can services be defined by functional targets.
In any case, the performance descriptions must be complete and unambiguous.
They must contain precise quantities and must not include services where it is not clear whether they are needed.
Compensation based on lump sums or on time is to be avoided as far as possible.
These provisions are intended to prevent speculation and manipulation based on unspecified requirements in the procurement documents.
The service descriptions must enable bidders to make their offers safely and without extensive preparatory work.
The call for tenders will not be made public until the tender documents have been completed.
Divergent rules
There is no obligation to tender for construction services in Losen in the Czech Republic.
If it is possible according to the type of service to be commissioned, the public procurement authorities can divide construction services into several lots.
In Germany, construction services are basically to be divided into lots, separated according to the quantity (partial) and / or according to type or subject areas (non-skilled).
The aim is to enable small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in the competition, to expand the number of potential suppliers and to make it more difficult to arrange prices.
This type of award is generally considered to be the most economical.
In the Czech Republic, assessment criteria must be set out in the award documents for both EU-wide and national procedures.
This should allow applicants to fully and conclusively identify the criteria on which their offers should be assessed.
In Germany, the specification of evaluation criteria in EU-wide notices, but at the latest in the procurement documents, is only required in EU-wide procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, the assessment criteria must only be set out in an internal administrative award notice.
Procurement documents, which are prepared by commissioned freelancers, may not contain any references to these offices or involved planners or consultants in Germany for the building construction and for some road construction authorities.
This is to prevent individual companies from obtaining additional information or other undue competitive advantages without the client's knowledge of contact with these freelancers.
This is also the reason why freelancers are not allowed to send procurement documents or to interpret planning documents for inspection.
The only contact person for the companies is the client.
There is currently no provision for this in the Czech Republic.
Additional or modified services, which turn out to be necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (additions), are almost always required for large-scale construction projects.
In both countries, the legal provisions make it possible, to a certain extent, to award additional contracts to the company that has already been commissioned, without having to carry out a public procurement procedure.
According to the EU regulations and the German regulations, the remuneration of the supplementary services must not exceed half of the main order.
In addition, the additional services must not be separated from the main order without significant disadvantages, or must be absolutely necessary.
In the Czech Republic, a narrower limit of 20% applies to the award of such contracts without a public notice.
However, this may increase the risk of delayed completion of the construction project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the construction work already underway.
If supplementary services are also transferred to the company that has already been commissioned, an arbitrary price increase for these services by the contractor is generally not possible under the regulations in Germany.
In determining the remuneration for the additional services, it is to be assumed that the agreed prices and the basis for determining the price of the order that has already been awarded.
In addition to supplementary services, there may also be a reduction in the scope of services.
In the Czech Republic, small quantities cannot be charged for additional supplementary services.
Key findings of the audit
BHR
Technical specifications and product-neutral bidding
In individual cases, the performance descriptions included references to national technical approvals or standards that had already been replaced by Europe-wide standards.
Some performance descriptions also included product-related specifications - for example, for graffiti protection, joints or noise protection plates - without the need for this.
In some cases, performance requirements were so accurately described that only one product was eligible.
Performance lists subdivided by partial services
In none of the cases examined has the BRH found any violation of the requirement to write out services in a list of services subdivided by partial services.
Completeness of performance descriptions
In the vast majority of cases, the procurement documents were completed before the start of the tenders.
In some cases, the procurement documents had to be corrected during the tender phase, as some positions or deadlines had changed.
In some cases, the performance lists contained positions that did not determine whether they were needed.
A list of services for demolition work even consisted of almost half of such requirements.
Loose and evaluation criteria
In the case of many awards, the prescribed justification was missing as to why the services, which were predominantly advertised for non-skilled persons, were not further divided into partial ones.
There were no complaints when specifying the criteria to be taken into account in the assessment of the offers.
References to freelancers
A small part of the performance descriptions contained references to the involved freelancers.
Some of their names were on the cover sheets or in attached plans or reports.
In one case, the contracting authority even explicitly asked the applicants to contact the architect "on questions of the tender."
In the construction sector in particular, the contracting authorities largely attributed the complaints to the failings of the freelancers responsible for drawing up the service descriptions.
The building services pointed to the lack of capacity in order to be able to adequately control the performance descriptions.
NKthe
Technical specifications and product-neutral tenders In the case of public procurement for the construction of a residential building with 12 residential units, a supplier and a specific product brand were specified in the performance description.
The contracting authority did not allow the use of comparable products without justifying it.
In the course of the construction of several university buildings, suppliers and products were also specified in the tender.
Performance descriptions with performance units
In the case of construction projects in some industrial areas, the contracting authority did not clearly specify the scope and type of services required in the performance descriptions.
As a performance unit, it only indicated the refurbished space of the individual buildings in cubic metres.
Completeness of performance descriptions
During the construction of a motorway bypass, the performance descriptions were changed four times in the period from August to September 2009 as part of a non-open procedure,
Since the scope of services had increased considerably and the technical requirements had changed.
Tender documents for social buildings contained inaccurate location information, insufficient technical preliminary examinations and incomplete design drawings, which required additional services to be commissioned.
When building a large library building, the performance description of the interior did not include any requirements for product quality.
As a result of these missing requirements, some subcontractors installed overpriced and unreasonably high-quality equipment.
Loose and fitness criteria
In the Czech Republic, the division of construction measures into partial contracts or the award of partial contracts is not compulsory.
An examination of the three large sections of the construction of a motorway ring showed that if selected parts were awarded separately, savings of up to €31.6 million could have been made at a total cost of €620.3 million.
In the case of six different buildings alone, which were the subject of a single contract, EUR 2.5 million (25%) could have been saved in the event of a separate award.
If the construction of 20 bridges were to be awarded separately, savings of €11.5 million (25%) would have been possible compared to a total allocation.
With regard to the award of construction services in road construction, the central contracting authority laid down very extensive reference requirements as fitness criteria.
In the construction of a part of a motorway, the contracting authority required the bidders, in an open procedure, to prove, among other things, that at least three road construction projects, worth 28 million euros each, had been carried out over the past five years.
In the Czech Republic, a maximum of nine suppliers met these requirements.
The public procurement of another section of a motorway consisted of six separate construction projects, in which the contracting authority had set an annual construction volume of at least €480 million over the last three years as an aptitude criterion for the companies.
Two-thirds of the funds raised for road construction projects in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. 2.5 billion euros out of a total of 3.7 billion euros) came from commissions from a total of five companies that carried out the contracts alone or as a joint venture.
In 46 bidding procedures with an order volume of 528 million euros, only two or even one bidder made an offer.
The NK pointed out that a narrowing of the market potential could lead to significant cost increases.
Additional services
In the case of the construction of a motorway bypass, the contracting authority did not apply any of the legal procedures for awarding additional services in two cases, nor did it enter into written contracts for the additional services.
Due to unclear quantity and quality specifications, additional orders were made in the first case of up to 63.7 million euros (net) and in the second case up to 165.4 million euros (net), which increased the respective order volume by 21% and 91% respectively.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In the case of several university buildings, some services were not listed in the procurement documents, although their necessity was already known in the award of the contract.
Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the limit of 20% of the original contract value laid down in national public procurement law, the contracting authority conducted negotiations with the contracted companies without notice.
In the case of the construction of a large court building, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional works in negotiation procedures without bidding.
During the construction period, the contracting authority extended the scope of the work by €2 million.
The unit prices for the additional construction services awarded without competition were significantly higher than those provided by the same company.
Other findings
On the basis of a sample of construction projects, the NK found that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway in the Czech Republic was up to €14.6 million.
In Deuschland, on the other hand, according to an analysis of long-term data from the Federal Ministry of Building, the average cost of a four-lane motorway kilometre is up to 10.4 million euros.
This comparison suggests that motorway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.
Summary findings
The basic rules on procurement documents are broadly consistent in both countries and take account of the EU's requirements.
They serve both full and fair competition and the prevention of corruption.
For example, the requirement for the sufficient accuracy of the performance descriptions should enable bidders to calculate and prepare their offers in an appropriate manner,
Protect the client from additional services to be agreed upon afterwards, and also limit the scope for speculation.
In Germany, the common basic requirements for the procurement documents are supplemented by regulations that are intended to further reduce restrictions on competition and the possibility of manipulation.
In the Czech Republic, there are no requirements to this extent, but transparency will be increased by publishing the evaluation criteria for non-EU procurement procedures.
The requirements for describing performance have largely been met in both countries.
In some cases, however, deviations had to be objected to, which may also have led to restrictions on competition.
The requirement for the formation of lots in Germany promotes competition and leads to economic results.
In the Czech Republic, according to the audit findings of the NK, the award of extensive services without lots, or with only very large lots, may result in restrictions on the provider's field to only a few large companies.
The extensive reference requirements for road construction in the Czech Republic have meant that public contracts are only awarded to a narrow range of suppliers and that small and medium-sized enterprises are not allowed to compete.
In addition, a limited number of competitors often lead to higher prices and increase the risk of price or other agreements.
When awarding and compensating for additional or modified services, the regulatory approaches in both countries differ.
According to the EU requirements as well as the German regulations, supplementary services with a value of up to half of the main contract can be awarded under certain conditions without public procurement procedures.
In the Czech Republic, a narrower limit of 20% applies, until additional services can be awarded to the original contractor in the negotiation process without notice.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This limit is often crossed,
Because the scope of services for public contracts is often insufficiently determined.
If the excess is greater than 20%, the additional benefits must be advertised with a public notice.
By splitting services into lots, restrictions on competition and the resulting adverse consequences can be avoided.
Determining the type of award and the eligibility of the EU threshold
By determining the type of award, the client determines the number of companies taking part in the competition.
It can leave the circle of potential candidates and bidders largely unrestricted, for example by choosing an open procedure, or by setting a limit on non-public procurement procedures.
For construction projects where a threshold set by the EU is reached or exceeded, Europe-wide procurement procedures are to be applied.
Requirements of EU law as well as the prevention of corruption
When selecting the type of award, the contracting authority must take into account, in particular, the European legal requirements for competition and transparency.
If the estimated total contract value of the construction services of a project is at or above the EU threshold of currently 5,000,000 euros, the construction services must in principle be awarded across Europe in accordance with open or non-open procedures.
In exceptional cases, negotiation procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.
In the case of construction projects that reach or exceed the EU threshold, the contracting authority may, to a limited extent, deviate from the principle of Europe-wide award and award works in national contracts, provided that the estimated contract value of the respective lot is less than €1,000,000 and the sum of these lots does not exceed 20% of the estimated total contract value of all construction contracts.
A uniform construction project must not be divided into individual measures without compelling reason, or deliberately valued at too low a cost, in order to avoid the obligation to award construction services on a Europe-wide basis.
As restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of type of award is of great importance in the prevention of corruption.
The detailed justification of the type of award chosen, as well as the examination of the obligation to apply the EU procurement rules, are important elements of the documentation of the award procedure.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
Both countries have fully implemented EU rules on procurement procedures and the threshold in national law.
Divergent rules
The Czech Republic has also transferred the fundamental equivalence of open and non-open procedures contained in the EU directive to its building contracts, which are not subject to EU requirements.
There is freedom of choice between the open procedure and the non-open procedure, without the decision being doctored or justified, but other procedures are only possible under certain legally defined conditions.
In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure or - in the case of national tenders - the public call for tenders are, in principle, a priority. This is determined by budgetary and public procurement law as well as by the guidelines for the prevention of corruption.
Other types of procurement - as well as the non-open procedure or the limited invitation to tender - are only possible in exceptional cases, which are finally regulated by the public procurement law.
The existence of an exceptional case must be substantiated and documented.
The principle of the primacy of the open procedure or the public tender is intended to ensure that competition is as unlimited as possible, to rule out the possibility of manipulation by fixing certain bidders, and to make it more difficult for bidders to agree on prices.
The principle of public tender is a central element of the prevention of corruption in Germany.
The correct estimation of the prospective contract value is an essential basis for choosing the right type of contract.
Construction services in Germany can use the planning and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations to determine the expected costs in the area of public construction.
These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects. The databases contain, among other things, cost indicators for building categories, utilization units, components or individual construction services.
On the basis of such cost indicators, it is possible to determine the expected order value of a planned ramp-up or construction performance to be awarded.
Corresponding cost databases for road construction have only a few building authorities in Germany.
However, a nationwide introduction for all road construction authorities is planned.
Contracting authorities in the Czech Republic cannot rely on central databases or average price surveys of comparable construction measures to determine the likely cost of construction services.
In most cases, the cost assessments are based on estimates from the financing body, or are based on the amount of funds made available to the construction service.
Measures to standardize cost-assessment procedures are still in their early stages.
As part of the anti-corruption plan for 2011-2012, the relevant ministries were commissioned to draw up a database of standardised building materials and materials.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This database will collect information on material expenditure and construction and development works, as well as other cost-relevant data, in order to enable cost assessments and provisions for unit prices.
The Czech Ministry of Transport has also issued a data collection for construction projects in order to better control costs,
Which is to be used as a benchmark for setting prices in the financing plan and is currently being updated.
Key audit results BRH
Selection of the award procedure
The audited contracting authorities largely signed off the construction services in an open procedure or in a public tender procedure, thus following the budgetary and public procurement requirements.
In 2011, 59.5% of the construction services of the federal government were advertised in public or in open proceedings.
In road construction, this figure was 94.8%.
When selecting non-public tender types, there was a lack of in-depth justification as to why the contracting authorities had to deviate from the principle of open procedure or public tender.
In a cross-cutting investigation, the BRH found, on the basis of more than 16,000 procurement procedures, that the non-public types of contracts have significant disadvantages in terms of competition compared to open procedures and public tenders, and increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.
In the construction sector, more than twice as many bids were submitted for public tenders as for limited tenders and almost three times as many offers as for freelance contracts.
The investigation also found that the offer prices for limited tenders and free-to-air tenders were on average 6% and 10% higher, respectively, than for public tenders.
Parallel investigations carried out by the Federal Ministry of Building and a State Court of Auditors confirmed the economic differences between public and non-public types of contracts.
As a result of its research into economic efficiency, the Federal Ministry of Construction even found twice as many differences between public and non-public procurement procedures.
Taking into account the EU threshold
In the case of construction projects for which they had calculated an estimated total order sum of more than €5,000,000, the audited contracting authorities generally set out procurement plans in which they set out the construction services to be awarded in accordance with the EU and national procurement procedures.
According to the procurement plans, this meant that more than 80% of construction services were to be awarded across the EU.
Circumventing the obligation to deliver across the EU by underestimating costs could not be ascertained.
However, in part as a result of incorrect calculations, there has been a de facto reduction in the minimum proportion of EU procurement procedures.
During the construction process, some contracting authorities improperly changed the terms of their procurement plans.
They did not substantiate these changes and did not prove that the minimum proportion of EU-wide procurement procedures remained in place.
For most of the construction measures examined, the proportion of EU-wide deliveries according to the settlement results was usually lower than planned under the procurement plan.
In some cases, in the case of construction projects above the EU threshold,
Instead, they chose national procedures.
NKthe
Selection of the type of award
In the case of several major construction projects, such as the construction of some sections of the motorway, construction projects in the context of a major sporting event and housing projects, the contracting authorities divided construction services into several sub-contracts, although these services were similar or comparable.
As a result of these divisions, the individual benefits were no longer above the threshold and were then awarded in simplified procedures or even in defiance of legal requirements.
Calculation methods for the estimated value of the order
In the field of road construction, the existing price databases for this area were only an inadequate instrument to be able to determine the expected value of the contract.
The data was based on construction projects that had just been completed, but in which there were indications of a lack of profitability, unnecessary additional performance costs or excessive profits for the commissioned companies.
For three sections of a motorway ring, the actual prices were about 37% lower than the estimated order values determined by the database.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Transport revised the databases in order to be able to take into account not only the offer prices of recent years, but also comparable market prices and price increases in the construction sector.
In the construction sector, the expected order values were based on cost values estimated by the repositories, or on estimates from investors.
The actual order values differed greatly from the estimates.
The estimated price for the refurbishment or expansion of a large library was twice as high as the value of the contract agreed upon later, but eight additions in the course of the construction led to an increase in costs of 2.1 million euros, or 27%.
Similarly, the actual contract value for the construction of a library depot was 33% lower than the estimated price, which also led to cost increases in the construction phase.
In other cases, supply prices exceeded estimates and increased during construction.
In the construction of a large library, the estimated price was exceeded by 16 million euros, or 22%. In the construction of a judicial building, costs rose disproportionately, at 139%, as the utility area had only expanded by 12%.
Summary findings
Both countries have implemented EU rules on how to determine the type of contract and how to comply with the EU threshold into national law, which is why the respective rules are broadly in line with each other.
However, the priority of the open procedure or public tender in Germany goes beyond the EU requirements and the regulations in force in the Czech Republic.
Compared to non-public procurement procedures, more companies have the opportunity to compete in public procedures or public tenders.
The public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of offers and to the most economical results.
The risk of corruption will be significantly improved by not restricting the field of application by the client's susceptible to manipulation, and by making it more difficult for bidders to agree on prices.
The investigations have confirmed the advantage of the primacy of the open procedure or the public tender procedure in Germany.
Under Czech law, contracting authorities can award contracts in an open or non-open procedure.
According to the latest changes to the public procurement law, the number of bidders may no longer be limited in cases involving previous competition.
As a result, the non-open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.
In Germany, the contracting authorities have largely complied with the requirements for the priority of the open procedure or the public tender procedure. In the Czech Republic, some services have been unlawfully allocated in order to be able to circumvent the requirements for the selection of the type of award.
When the EU threshold was reached, errors had to be found in Germany, which resulted in a reduction in the minimum proportion of benefits declared across the EU.
In the Czech Republic, there is not yet a satisfactory solution in order to be able to accurately determine the expected costs of construction services and construction projects.
If necessary, the building authorities should ensure, through further checks, that the requirements for selecting the type of contract, as well as the scope of services to be awarded across the EU, are complied with, or that the conditions for accurate cost assessments are created.
Advance information and notice
In the case of construction projects with construction services to be awarded across Europe, the public contractor has to inform interested companies about the planned contracts in advance of the tender.
Preliminary information and announcements form an important basis for a Europe-wide competition.
Requirements of EU law as well as the prevention of corruption
The preliminary information is intended to contain the essential public procurement information on the planned construction projects.
They are required for those construction projects where the estimated total contract value reaches or exceeds the EU threshold and where the client wants to shorten the offer periods of open or non-open procedures.
In announcements, the client is required to provide further details on the planned construction contracts to be awarded throughout Europe.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In it, he has to make known, among other things, the scope of services, the process and execution dates, the special requirements, as well as the evaluation criteria and their weighting.
The vocabulary of the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV codes), which is standardized across Europe, is to be used in the description of the subject of the order.
Preliminary information and notices will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the client's procurement profile.
In order to prevent discrimination against foreign interested parties, notices at the national level may not contain any additional information and may only be issued to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union after the notice has been sent.
Incomplete or inaccurate information in the notice may affect competition and, if necessary, may even support manipulation.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
Both countries have fully implemented the EU legal requirements for advance information and notification into national law.
Divergent rules
In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and announcements are also to be published in the case of construction services that are not to be sold across Europe.
Procurement procedures may begin at the earliest one month after the advance information has been sent to the EU Official Journal (for EU-wide contracts) or to the national Official Journal (for all contracts).
It is only in exceptional cases that the publication of a preliminary information can be dispensed with.
In Germany, no advance information is required in the non-EU procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, notices for public tenders and participation competitions must be published on the Federal Government's Internet portal and, if necessary, in newspapers or magazines, before limited tenders.
In the case of limited tenders without competition, notices of services to be awarded from 25,000 euros are required (ex-ante transparency).
All planned lots of the construction projects are to be listed in the preliminary information.
In Germany, this is of particular importance because of the small size of the detached building contracts.
In the Czech Republic, the impact of this scheme is limited, as there are significantly fewer construction services being divided into lots.
Key findings of the audit
BRH
Preliminary information
The contracting authorities examined published preliminary information on all audited construction projects with construction services to be awarded across Europe.
However, in the case of some open procedures, they shortened the deadline for offers, even though the 52-day period required between the pre-information and the notices had not yet expired.
Other shortened procedures were only put out to tender after the 12-month period of prior information had already expired and before it had been extended.
In the case of many published preliminary information, there was no indication of the planned distribution of construction services in lots.
Announcements
The notices issued by the audited bodies contained some CPV codes that deviated from the information provided in the preliminary information or that did not accurately cover the required services.
In individual cases, notices were published earlier at national level or contained more information - for example, on implementation deadlines - than the notices in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Ex-ante transparency
The contracting authorities of an audited building administration had commissioned a service company to publish the national procurement procedures.
The company published the reports on its own fee-based procurement platform.
However, the contracting authorities did not check whether the company had also forwarded the reports to the Federal Government's free internet portal, as required.
Samples showed that only a third of the audited administration's reports were published on this portal.
NKthe
Announcements
When constructing a sewage treatment plant, the contracting authority did not specify in its notice the criteria on which it wanted to select the bidders.
The contracting authority was not able to prove how the bidders were selected.
The restriction of the number of bidders was permitted under the law in force at the time.
In the case of the construction of a motorway ring, the contracting authority did not specify in any open procedure either in the notice or in the documentation of the award procedure, according to which it would assess the qualifications of the applicants and how many applicants it wanted to allow to compete.
In its assessment, the contracting authority concluded that all six applicants met the qualification requirements, but excluded the applicants with the worst ratings from the further procedure.
The contracting authority's approach was not transparent because it had not disclosed information on the qualification criteria and the evaluation procedure at any point in the procedure.
Publication of the notices
In the case of the renovation of former military sites, the contracting authority did not publish the tender.
Summary findings
The two-stage education system, with advance information and notice, is an important part of implementing the transparency requirement for Europe-wide contracts, strengthening competition and thus preventing corruption.
Both countries have implemented the EU requirements and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures, including in the national procurement sector:
Selection of candidates for non-public contracts
In contrast to public procurement procedures, not every company interested in carrying out the services to be awarded will be able to compete in the non-public procurement procedures.
In the case of non-public procurement procedures, the contracting authority must make a selection beforehand as to which companies should be invited to submit tenders.
Requirements of EU law as well as the prevention of corruption The EU rules allow for a limit on the number of applicants for EU-wide non-public procurement procedures.
However, in the case of non-open procedures, at least five companies are required to submit tenders.
At least three companies are to be invited to take part in the negotiation procedure with the announcement of the contract.
In any case, the number of invited candidates must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be disclosed beforehand.
The selection of demanding companies is a process within the procurement process that is highly susceptible to manipulation, for example by allowing certain companies to be given one-sided preference.
In addition, restricting competition to a small number of companies also favours possible agreements between candidates.
In both cases, the result can be significantly impaired at the expense of the client.
The contracting authorities must therefore take special precautions against possible manipulation, carry out sufficient checks and, in particular, ensure the transparency and traceability of this step in the process.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
The rules for selecting candidates are similar in both countries.
In addition to the EU requirements, when selecting candidates, the contracting authorities are to switch as often as possible among the companies that are required to do so.
Nor should competition be limited to companies based in certain regions.
The contracting authorities have to justify the selection of the candidates and document the course of the selection process in their award notices.
Divergent rules
In Germany, in the case of limited tenders, at least three candidates are to be invited to submit offers, and in the case of voluntary tenders, several suitable candidates are to be invited to submit offers.
Under the new Czech rules, it is inadmissible - apart from two specific areas - to limit the number of bidders in the event of open procedures and negotiation procedures.
In Germany, the multi-eyes principle is to be observed when selecting companies.
For example, if an employee has proposed a number of companies for a non-public procurement procedure, the management level of the construction service or a commissioner from the contracting authority generally have to amend this proposal by, for example, removing a proposed company and / or supplementing a new company.
The aim is to prevent a single person from being able to definitively determine the circle of companies to be involved in the competition.
Otherwise, in the case of manipulative intentions, this could allow for far-reaching agreements between the parties involved.
The list of companies to be requested is to be treated confidentially - even with regard to freelancers - and not to be made available to the general public.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In the Czech Republic, there are no appropriate regulations for setting up and keeping secret lists of applicants.
According to the German regulations, freelancers are not allowed to determine the companies to be asked to do so, but can only submit proposals to the contracting authority.
There is a regulatory loophole in Czech legislation in this regard.
Key findings of the audit
BRH
Number of applicants
The requirement to require a minimum number of companies to bid for non-public contracts has been met, with only a few exceptions.
An evaluation of the BRH of almost 7,000 non-Europe-wide procurement procedures for construction services in civil engineering showed that the contracting authorities charged an average of 6.6 for limited tenders by the federal government in Germany and an average of 4.4 companies for tenders in the case of voluntary contracts.
Switching companies and regional restrictions
In particular, in the case of trades with a few suppliers, the contracting authorities did not always change the circle of selected candidates.
They took into account, above all, companies already known to them and proven from their point of view.
As a reason for this, they stated that, in the case of non-public proceedings, they would have to ensure the suitability of the companies that are required to compete before the invitation to submit an offer.
The BRH did not find an inadmissible restriction on regional bidders in the non-public procurement procedures, but it did find a higher proportion of regional companies than in the case of public tenders.
The contracting authorities attributed this primarily to the fact that, on average, the scope of services in non-public procurement procedures is much lower and therefore, for example, longer access routes are more important than in public tenders.
More eyes and proposals for freelancers
Contrary to the rules, the contracting authorities largely failed to change the proposed list of companies to be required by an independent person.
They justified this, in particular, with a lack of processing capacity, time pressure or insufficient knowledge of alternative suitable companies.
It was also often not documented who had proposed the companies that had been asked to make the offer.
Some samples showed that freelancers had drawn up the list of candidates and that these proposals had been accepted by the contracting authorities unchanged.
As a result, the contracting authorities did not protect themselves from possible manipulation to the extent required.
Confidential handling of bidding lists
In the case of a contracting authority, the lists of companies to be requested were recorded in a data processing system that could be viewed by all employees of this service.
In the case of manipulative intentions, the names of the planned or authorised companies could have been passed on without authorisation and could, for example, have enabled agreements to be made between these companies.
Documentation
The documentation of the award procedures contained only a few reasons for selecting the candidates.
NKthe
Selection of candidates
During the construction of a motorway ring, the bidders did not receive any information on the assessment criteria and the evaluation procedures.
In the non-open procedures for the development and modernisation of waterways and ports, the notices did not contain any information on how the selection of candidates should be carried out.
In a trial, all eight participating candidates met the qualification requirements, exceeding the maximum number of companies to be admitted.
As a result, the award committee carried out a procedure for selecting the companies.
However, this procedure, which was in principle permissible at the time, should have been cited as one of the criteria in the notice.
Summary findings
Due to the high risk of manipulation in the selection of candidates in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special precautions to prevent undue restrictions on competition.
With the multi-eyes principle, the secrecy of the bidders' lists and the exclusive authority of the contracting authorities to propose the companies to be charged, the German regulations restrict such opportunities for abuse.
In the case of Czech regulations, the newly introduced requirement for the largely unlimited number of bidders in non-public proceedings can, in particular, counteract possible manipulative restrictions.
However, the audit findings have shown that some of these requirements have been poorly implemented and that the potential for manipulation for abusive restriction of the field of participants has not been sufficiently reduced in these cases.
The contracting authorities should completely eliminate the shortcomings that have been identified.
Bidding phase
With the announcement of the award or the invitation to tender, the bidding phase begins, during which the companies can draw up offers on the basis of the tender documents sent to them.
Applicants will be able to submit their offers until the deadline set by the contracting authority has expired.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
There are no separate EU legal requirements for this phase of the procurement process.
The contracting authorities have to comply with the national regulations, which are intended to counteract the possibilities of manipulation that exist during the offer phase.
These are, above all, organisational requirements and controls.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
The procurement documents, on the basis of which the companies are to draw up their offers, are, in principle, only to be sent by the contracting authority.
Freelancers involved in the procurement process are not allowed to carry out this task.
The contracting authority must ensure that all applicants receive the same information during the tender period.
In the event of ambiguity in the award documents or other questions relating to the call for tenders, only the contracting authority may provide information to the applicants.
Freelancers commissioned to draw up the procurement documents are not allowed to provide information.
During the entire offer phase, contact between the commissioned freelancers and the applicants must be prevented.
Freelance workers must not become a hub of the procurement process, through which contacts with anti-competitive consequences can be established.
Offers sent directly or by mail must be submitted in a closed envelope.
Electronically transmitted offers have to show a technical encryption.
Divergent rules
In Germany, the contracting authority can also commission external service companies with the printing and dispatch of the procurement documents, whose employees are obliged to keep the offers secret and to comply with the contractual obligations in a conscientious manner.
The offers received must be marked with an entrance stamp in Germany and must be sent immediately, immediately and unopened to an employee responsible for custody.
This official may not be involved in the award.
The offers received must be kept under wraps until the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, the offers received are marked with a file number.
The contracting authority records the quotation data, including order numbers, as well as the creation and receipt information in a protocol.
The custody of the offers is not regulated in the Czech Republic.
Key findings of the audit
BRH
The tests for the offer phase focused primarily on the procurement procedures of a building management department.
Dispatch of the procurement documents
The contracting authorities of the inspected civil engineering administration sent the procurement documents themselves or had them printed and sent by an external service company.
Freelancers did not send tender documents.
Information to applicants
For the most part, the inspected building management did not comply with the requirements for the separation of planning and assignment when appointing the contact persons for inquiries and information.
In the service descriptions, contrary to the requirements, she did not name employees from the contracting authority, but rather from the project management as contact persons.
Some procurement documents even included the names of the freelancers who had produced the performance descriptions.
In case of enquiries during the offer phase, not all applicants received the same information in individual cases.
Labelling of offers
In the case of the inspected building management, all the offers received were provided with an entrance stamp and an entrance note.
However, in the case of some freelancers, the offers were received by freelancers, which contradicted the requirements for the prevention of corruption.
Preservation of the offers
According to their identification, not all offers were immediately and immediately received by the custody officer, who included the offers in a steel cabinet.
In the meantime, in a construction service, the offers were placed in an open compartment of the post office, to which each employee had access.
Another department had hung up a mailbox in a hallway that was not constantly monitored, in which some of the offers made there remained overnight.
Since the insertion slot of this letterbox was large and unsecured, not only staff but also visitors to the service would have had the opportunity to extract and, if necessary, manipulate incoming offers.
NKthe
No defects were reported on the Czech side.
Summary findings
During the bidding phase, contacts between interested companies and freelancers involved in the procurement process are to be prevented in both countries.
In addition, by providing all bidders with the same information, the principle of equal treatment should be respected.
The rules governing the receipt, storage and confidentiality of the offers appear suitable to counteract manipulation and corruption.
The corresponding requirements in Germany are somewhat more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
The results of the investigation in Germany have revealed violations of the regulations in some areas.
These shortcomings could be remedied with little effort.
Opening of offers
Opening of offers
During the opening date, the previously closed offers will be opened and their contents will be read out and made public.
From the opening date, the bidders will be bound by their offers until the deadline set by the contracting authority has expired.
Requirements of EU law as well as the prevention of corruption
There are no separate EU legal provisions for opening the offers.
However, for this highly sensitive phase of the procurement process, the national anti-corruption rules contain extensive requirements to protect bids and competition.
The multi-eyes principle, as well as the transparency and traceability of the opening of the offer, are intended to prevent manipulation and alterations to the submitted offers.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
The opening date is to be carried out by a number of persons to be appointed by the contracting authority.
The multi-eyes principle is designed to prevent individuals from being able to manipulate the offers unchecked when opening the offers.
Bidders will be able to take part in the opening ceremony for most of the bidding procedures.
Only offers that have been submitted to the negotiator at the opening of the first offer are allowed to open.
In principle, late offers may no longer be taken into account.
In order to ensure the transparency of the opening date, the actions taken and the results of the opening of the offer must be recorded in a protocol in which, among other things, the names of the bidders and the offer prices must be recorded.
The protocol must be read out and signed by the negotiating committee.
It can also be signed by the bidders present.
Divergent rules
In the Czech Republic, a committee is carrying out the opening of the bids.
Freelancers can also play a part in this.
The committee can also be tasked with further phases of the award process, such as the evaluation of the offers.
In Germany, a negotiator and a secretary are carrying out the opening of the offer.
The chief negotiator must be an employee of the contracting body.
The chief negotiator and, in the case of contracts in the building, also the writer should not be involved in the processing of the procurement documents, as well as in the award and contract processing.
According to the German regulations, the minutes of the opening date also contain information on discounts and discounts, as well as special features - such as damaged or delayed offers - in addition to the offer prices.
In the Czech Republic, in addition to the offer price, only the language of the offer as well as the signature authority of the applicant will be recorded.
The German regulations stipulate that the open offers must be marked in all parts in such a way that subsequent changes and additions are prevented.
The offers are usually marked by perforations with the date of the opening date. They are to be kept secret after the opening date and may only be made available to those directly responsible for the processing.
Czech regulations do not exist.
If only one bid is received in a tender procedure in the Czech Republic, it must not be opened and must be returned unvalued.
There is no such regulation in Germany. If there is only one offer, it must be opened and then evaluated.
Key findings of the audit
BRH
More-eyes principle
At the opening ceremonies, the audited contracting authorities implemented the requirements for the multi-eye principle.
They carried out the opening dates with negotiators and writers who were not charged with any other award treatment.
However, there have been a number of cases where freelancers have opened offers sent to them without the involvement of the contracting authority.
Minutes
In the minutes of the opening dates, the opening of the offerings was not always fully documented.
In some cases, for example, the late-filed offers were not registered, and in some cases even signatures were missing.
Labelling of offers
The contracting authorities examined in the context of the cross-sectional examination identified the offers in accordance with the requirements by perforating them with the date of the opening date.
In the case of long-term tests carried out by some beneficiaries, insufficient markings had been found.
However, these contracting authorities changed their labelling practices following the complaint by the BRH.
NKthe
Deadline for bidding
In the case of the award of road maintenance measures, an offer was received by the contracting authority only one month after the expiration of the offer period. Nevertheless, the contracting authority accepted this offer.
Summary findings
The rules of both countries to open the offers agree in significant parts. They take into account both the multi-eyes principle and the principle of transparency. As a result, the risks of corruption and manipulation in opening the offers can be significantly limited.
The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
In particular, the requirements for the precise documentation of the procedure as well as for the marking, safe storage and confidentiality of the offers significantly restrict the possibility of manipulation, such as subsequent changes to the offers.
In addition, the officers responsible for opening the offers are not allowed to perform any other tasks in connection with the service to be awarded.
All in all, only a few complaints demonstrate the high level of acceptance of the requirements for the opening of the offer.
Examination and evaluation of the offers
Examination and evaluation of the offers The client has to examine and evaluate the offers available at the opening date.
In doing so, he has to determine the offer for the award of the contract, which is best suited to the requirements according to the given award criteria.
Requirements of EU law as well as the prevention of corruption
The EU's guidelines provide for a multi-level procedure:
First of all, the suitability of the bidders has to be determined.
Bidders must be economically and financially efficient and have the necessary professional and technical expertise.
In principle, companies that are legally convicted of fraud, for example, for bribery, must be excluded from participating in the award process.
The offers made by the non-excluded bidders are to be examined in a computational, technical and economic manner and assessed on the basis of the award criteria previously announced.
The client has to determine the most economically advantageous offer. Offers with unusually low prices have to be examined by the client in particular.
The examination and evaluation of the offers is a particularly tamper-prone phase of the award process.
For example, bidders can be unjustifiably excluded or offers that do not meet the requirements can be left in competition.
By favouring or discriminating against bidders, the result of the valuation can be unacceptably impaired and thus the determination of the most economically advantageous offer can be prevented.
The contracting authority must therefore take special precautions to ensure that the persons responsible for the examination and evaluation meet the requirements of integrity and expertise.
It must also ensure that the procedure and the decisions taken are transparent and verifiable.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
In line with the requirements of the EU, offers in both countries must be examined and evaluated in multi-stage procedures.
The requirements for the companies' proof of aptitude to be presented, as well as the award criteria to be taken into account in the assessment and their weighting, are laid down in the notices or in the procurement documents and can no longer be changed during the procedure.
Once the bidding has been verified, the eligibility criteria may no longer be used in the evaluation of the bids.
The rating has to be limited to the award criteria.
The submitted offers must first be formally examined immediately as to whether they are complete and whether, for example, they contain abnormalities that could indicate possible manipulation intentions.
If bidders are excluded from the further examination and evaluation of their offers, they must be informed immediately.
If the valuation of the offers results in an unreasonably low price, the bidder must be given the opportunity to comment before a possible exclusion of his offer.
The decisions taken during the examination and evaluation of the offers are to be documented in a comprehensible manner.
Divergent rules
In Germany, the offers to be kept secret may only be made available to those directly responsible for processing.
The inspection of the offers as well as the computational examination of the offers can only be carried out by the contracting authority.
It will only have to employ staff who are not involved in the award decision or the implementation of the measure.
The performance of the further examination and evaluation tasks is not regulated in more detail.
If freelancers are entrusted with the examination and evaluation, they have to treat the offers confidentially.
They are only allowed to make proposals for the decisions to be taken by the contracting authorities.
In the Czech Republic, procurement committees are to be set up to examine and evaluate the offers.
The committees draw up evaluation reports with proposals for contracts.
In the end, as in Germany, only the contracting authorities have to decide on the contracts.
If evidence or declarations requested for the submission of the bid in Germany are only incompletely filed, the contracting authority must give the bidders the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.
Only if the documents are still not available after the expiration of the deadline, the offer must be excluded from the evaluation.
In the Czech Republic, it is up to the contracting authority to decide whether it will give bidders the opportunity to complete missing evidence or explanations.
If a bidder fails to do so, it must be ruled out.
In Germany, in addition to the total price, the unit prices (prices for partial services) of the offers are also to be examined.
If, as a result of the price structure of the offer, there are indications that prices for partial services are too low or too high, the bidder must be asked to remove these ambiguities.
If he fails to do so, and if the contracting authority can provide proof of a mixed calculation of prices, this offer must be ruled out.
This is to prevent bidders from speculating on significant changes in the volume of partial services when calculating their offer, which can lead to significant increases in the cost of construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, the total price is assessed, but not the appropriateness of the prices for partial services.
A mixed calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.
In Germany, a surcharge may not be awarded on offers with unreasonably high or low prices.
If one or more offers fall short of the correct price determination of the client or the offer amounts of the other bidders by 10% or more, the bidders have to prove the correct calculation of their offers.
If they are not able to do so, the contracting authority may rule out the offers in question.
In the Czech Republic, the tender can be cancelled after an assessment of profitability if there are only offers that cannot be justified at low prices.
In contrast to German public procurement law, the surcharge cannot be refused in the case of offers with prices substantially higher than the client's calculation for this reason.
If there is a suspicion of anti-competitive behaviour in Germany, the contracting authority must immediately report to its technical supervisor at the leading level.
It has to decide what measures to take and whether to inform the Antitrust Authority or the Public Prosecutor's Office.
For example, the technical supervisor must agree to more than 50,000 euros for construction services, if a contract is to be awarded freely, if a contract is not to be awarded on the offer with the lowest price, or if the tender is to be cancelled.
There are no such regulations in the Czech Republic.
Key findings of the audit
BRH
Suitability and evaluation criteria
The vast majority of the procurement procedures examined were in line with the requirements set out above.
In the case of some companies proposed by freelancers, the contracting authorities did not check the suitability of the companies themselves.
A beneficiary commissioned companies without the required proof of fitness being fully available.
In some cases, it was not clear whether the contracting authority had taken into account all the award criteria announced in its selection decision, or whether it had merely based its award decision on the "price" criterion.
Selection of the people involved and confidentiality of the offers
Some contracting authorities used unauthorised persons to examine the offers for this purpose.
For example, freelance workers or staff involved in planning or carrying out a construction project carried out tasks that could only be carried out by employees of the contracting authority.
The construction services justified this with insufficient staffing capacity in the respective areas.
In some cases, the freelancers charged with examining the offers also worked with employees who were not obliged to keep the offers secret and to comply with the contractual obligations in a conscientious manner.
For the construction services, it was mostly not clear whether the offers for freelancers were only accessible to those directly responsible for processing.
Review and computational examination of the offers
Some contracting authorities handed over the open offers to freelancers for further examination, without first having carried out the prescribed review of the offers and the computational examination itself, and having doctored their results.
In the case of manipulative intentions, third parties would have been able to make changes to the offers without this being understandable to the contracting authorities.
In the documents examined, abnormalities or lack of price or product information were in some cases not marked, or only insufficiently marked.
Performance examinations
In the case of a sample in a civil engineering administration, the cheapest offers for three quarters of the audited procurement procedures deviated more than 10% from the previously determined estimated costs.
One in 20 bidding procedures has been cancelled due to inappropriate bid prices.
Not all of the bidding tests and enlightenment discussions with the bidders were comprehensible or sufficiently documented.
In many cases, there was a lack of more detailed information, such as on the unit prices of the most important positions.
In many cases, the deviations were only generally justified, for example by references to changed market prices or increased material costs.
Construction officials said it was difficult to detect and prove mixed calculations.
In the case of a call for tenders from an institution under public law, the offer price of the cheapest offer was 66% below the previously estimated value of these services.
Further calculations or examinations of the causes of this deviation were not documented.
In an enlightenment interview, the contracting authority found no evidence of price dumping by the then commissioned company.
As a result, it remained unclear whether the estimated value was too high or whether the offer price was too low.
Later, the client assessed the contracted company as a "low-cost company," which could not maintain quality or deadlines.
In another call for tenders, a construction service awarded the contract for an offer, the price of which was 35% higher than the value of the cost assessment.
She did not cancel the call for tenders, citing the non-factual justification that this company could be concluded on a reasonable calculation.
Suspicions of irregularities
There have been two cases of irregularities in an audited building administration, both of which have been reported to the technical supervisor.
In one of the cases, the calculation of two bidders was identical in a call for tenders, so that the contracting authority excluded both bids from the procedure.
In the application of the remaining regulations, the tests did not give rise to any significant objections.
NKthe
Aptitude test
For many of the construction projects examined, including university construction, road construction and the extension of the rail network, the contracting authorities did not exclude bidders from the procedure, although they did not meet the requirements set out in the tender documents or could not prove their suitability to the prescribed extent. On the other hand, in one case, a contracting authority could neither prove nor explain why it had excluded a bidder who had met the requirements.
Scoring
When awarding construction services for a water treatment plant, the contracting authority did not take into account the specified evaluation criteria when examining and evaluating the offers.
In the case of a construction project to expand the railway network, the contracting authority only determined the weighting of the evaluation criteria at the beginning of the evaluation.
In the case of road conservation measures, the predetermined criterion of "shortening the construction phase" was misjudged in a procedure.
As a result, the proposed reduction was insufficiently taken into account by bidders in second and third positions.
Documentation of the selection of offers
In three procurement procedures in the context of housing development, the contracting authority did not document the criteria it applied and the basis on which it had selected the successful bidder.
During the construction of a motorway, the contracting authority selected companies for smaller orders of up to 20,000 euros on the basis of telephone surveys on prices and delivery conditions alone.
Examinations of this selection were not possible, as the interviews were not documented.
Summary findings
The regulations for testing and evaluating the offers in both countries are in line with the requirements of the EU.
However, with regard to the details of the procedure and the selection of the persons involved, the respective regulations differ from each other.
In Germany, the process is more regulated than in the Czech Republic by detailed requirements, in particular for the implementation of the multi-eyes principle and for the protection of offers.
The same applies to the requirements on the basis of which the appropriateness of the prices offered must be assessed.
In both countries, in some of the procurement procedures examined, it had to be established that significant procedural steps in the examination and evaluation of the offers were not, or were not, sufficiently documented.
However, without traceability and transparency of the audit and evaluation decisions, possible manipulative interventions will be encouraged.
A particularly serious defect was the handing over of all offers to third parties, without the public contracting authority having sufficiently examined and documented the offers beforehand, thereby protecting them from possible manipulation in the further proceedings.
If public authorities have tasks carried out by third parties in the examination and evaluation of the offers, sufficient precautions and an increased control effort are required to counter the increased risk of manipulation.
When assessing the adequacy of the prices, the audited services in Germany did not always make full use of the specified instruments, and did not sufficiently examine the price structure of the offers.
In the Czech Republic, complaints arose mainly during the aptitude test as well as in the application of the evaluation criteria.
Completion of the award procedure
After testing and valuing the bids, the award process will be completed by awarding the contract or by cancelling the procedure.
Requirements of EU law as well as the prevention of corruption
In the case of EU-wide procurement procedures, all bidders must be informed in advance of the proposed award decision.
The companies have the possibility to examine the intended award in the case of information by electronic means or by fax within 10 days or with other means of communication within 15 days and, if necessary, to initiate a review procedure.
A contract may not be concluded before the end of this information period.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
If a bidder makes a request for a review within the information period, it is only possible to conclude a contract after the final decision in the review procedure.
Companies can also have the award decision reviewed by an independent court as part of this review process.
The review procedure is intended to ensure the legal protection of the companies and to encourage the client to comply with the public procurement law throughout the award procedure.
In order to do this, he has to document the procedure sufficiently.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
Both countries have implemented EU rules on information and verification procedures.
In both countries, the contracting authority has to decide on the award of the contract.
However, it must not deviate arbitrarily from the result of a proper examination and evaluation of the offers.
The client is to issue the order within the announced deadline for the award of the contract,
This is also because the bidders are no longer bound by their offers after the deadline.
In the case of open and non-open procedures or public and limited tenders, the client must not, in principle, deviate from the content of the offer at the time of conclusion of the contract.
The inferior bidders must be informed of the award decision and the reasons for not taking their offers into account in a timely manner.
Tendering procedures may only be cancelled under certain conditions, for example if the offer prices are excessive or if the offers do not meet the requirements of the tender.
Divergent rules
In the Czech Republic, the 10-day or 15-day obligation to provide information and maintenance prior to the award of the contract also applies to construction services that are not to be awarded across Europe.
In Germany, these requirements apply only to the area of EU-wide distribution.
In the case of other proceedings in Germany, bidders can only be informed of the award decision after the award of the contract.
In the Czech Republic, an award procedure has to be repealed if only one offer has been received or only one offer has been evaluated.
In Germany, the surcharge must also be awarded in the case of only one valuable offer, provided that it meets the conditions of the tender and is economical.
Key findings of the audit
BRH
In the case of verified contracts, there were only a few complaints at the conclusion of the award procedures.
In some cases, companies have already received letters of order for EU-wide contracts before the end of the information deadlines, which may result in the ineffectiveness of the contract.
According to open procedures, contract letters also contained content that deviated from the content of the offer in individual cases, such as changed dates.
In several cases, the contracting authorities did not comply with the award deadlines.
In the case of an open procedure, a contracting authority therefore awarded the contract for the second cheapest offer, as a company with a 50% cheaper offer was no longer prepared to carry out the services at the price originally offered after the expiration of the contract period.
NKthe
In the case of a construction project in the higher education sector, the contracting authority deviated from the bidder's offer in terms of content in the contract.
In the case of some contracts, such as road maintenance works, the construction of a motorway and a bypass, the contracting authorities concluded the contracts at the end of the legal period.
When awarding construction services for the refurbishment of former military sites, the contracting authority only directed the announcement of the award of the contract to all bidders after the expiry of the legal deadline.
Summary findings
Both countries have implemented the EU's requirements at the end of the procurement process.
The legal protection of the inferior candidates or bidders will increase the instruments for preventing corruption.
In Czech public procurement law, the scope of legal protection is also extended to contracts below the EU thresholds.
In both countries, the deadlines for awarding contracts have been exceeded.
This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.
In the future, building authorities should avoid the shortcomings that have been identified in the completion of their procurement procedures.
Documentation, reporting and reporting obligations
The award procedures are to be documented clearly during their individual stages in view of the relevant findings as well as the reasons for the individual decisions.
In the case of EU-wide procedures, the contracts awarded must be made known.
The order data will also be recorded in an EU statistic.
Requirements of EU law as well as the prevention of corruption Through the documentation of the procurement procedures, a basic requirement of the EU-wide transparency requirement is implemented.
A carefully and promptly prepared documentation makes it possible to trace the award decisions.
In particular, it also provides effective legal protection for bidders for contracts above the EU thresholds.
Proper documentation is also an essential part of preventing corruption, as the compulsion to substantiate procurement decisions in detail significantly reduces the scope for manipulation.
The notice of a contract awarded in an EU-wide procurement procedure has to be sent to the EU Office for Official Publications within 48 days.
The Office publishes the notices in the Official Journal of the EU, which also implements the transparency requirement.
The contracting authorities also have to collect the essential data from their procurement procedures and report it to the EU Commission via the relevant national ministries.
On this basis, the EU Commission draws up annual EU statistics to provide an overview of the development of the internal market in construction services.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
Both countries have fully implemented the EU legal requirements for documentation and reporting requirements into national law.
The rules on documentation and reporting for EU statistics are largely the same in both countries.
Divergent rules
In the Czech Republic, the obligation to publish contracts awarded is not only limited to EU-wide contracts, but also extends to other procurement procedures.
The notice period is shortened to 15 days.
In Germany, in addition to the EU-wide contracts, there is an obligation to publish only in the case of limited tenders and in the case of free-to-air contracts from value limits of 25,000 euros and 15,000 euros without VAT (so-called ex-post transparency).
Below these limits, as well as in the case of public tenders, only the companies involved in the competition procedure will receive information about the orders.
Key findings of the audit
BRH
Documentation
A large number of the procurement procedures examined were not fully documented.
The award notices did not include all the necessary information, such as the justification of product specifications or references to national regulations.
In the case of an award procedure, the contracting authority did not justify why it awarded the contract to a company, although its offer did not include mandatory proof.
In a few cases, the documents of the contracting authorities did not contain all the evidence necessary for the documentation of the award procedure.
Notices on order assignments
In some EU-wide procurement procedures, the contracting authorities failed to publicise the awarding of contracts.
In further procurement procedures, there was no evidence that the contracting authorities had disclosed the contracts that had been awarded.
Reporting and reporting obligations
The statistics obtained contained the required minimum data, which had been prepared and sent out on time.
Ex-post transparency
In most cases, the audited building authorities published the contract data of the completed procurement procedures.
However, in the case of a building administration, this data was not published due to a transmission error.
The building administration only noticed this error after half a year,
As a result, the contract data of the procurement procedures completed up to then have not been published.
NKthe
Documentation
In the case of construction measures for the organisation of a major sporting event, the documentation of the award procedures showed considerable shortcomings, mainly in the form of incorrect information, such as incorrect quotation prices in the minutes of the evaluation commissions.
In addition, some protocols of the offer openings were not signed.
Notices on order assignments
In the case of several road construction projects, announcements about contracts awarded were only delayed or not published at all.
Summary findings
The rules governing documentation and reporting and reporting obligations are broadly in line in both countries and implement the EU's requirements.
In principle, this ensures the transparency of the procurement procedures, including the assignment of contracts.
The regulations to be applied in the Czech Republic for publication go a little further than the requirements in Germany.
The shortcomings in the documentation and notices revealed significantly limited the preventive effect of these instruments in the respective procurement procedures.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The building authorities should further improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and assignments and fully comply with their reporting and reporting obligations.
Summary evaluation and recommendations
The parallel audits carried out by the NIC and the BRH have focused on two main areas, which are essential in the Czech Republic and Germany for the award of construction services by public authorities: The application of EU procurement rules and the prevention of corruption.
The requirements of EU law allow cross-border competition to create a single European market.
Anti-corruption measures are not only designed to prevent or at least reduce corruption, but also to avert economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the state.
The audit findings of the two audit courts on the application of the public procurement rules in both countries, as well as the comparison of these regulations, provide insights into the similarities and differences that can be helpful for both countries in the further development of their public procurement law and its application.
Application of EU public procurement rules
Both countries have implemented the EU's requirements for the award of construction services into national law.
Thus, in the Czech Republic and in Germany, there is an important common basis for awarding construction services and for taking into account the essential requirements of competition, the equal treatment of the companies involved and the transparency of the procurement procedures.
The building authorities in both countries have, in some cases, largely backed up these bids with additional administrative provisions.
The Czech Republic has also largely transferred the requirements for the construction services to be awarded across the EU to its nationally adjustable procurement procedures below the EU threshold.
However, investigations carried out by the audit bodies have shown that the building authorities have not fully complied with the requirements of EU law in all areas.
The building authorities in Germany should further improve the quality of their procurement procedures in order to be able to remove the complaints that have been raised in the implementation of the EU requirements.
In particular, the tests carried out in the Czech Republic have highlighted risks that affect the cost-effectiveness of the contracts.
For example, incomplete performance descriptions required additional services, which were often awarded in violation of legislation. In addition, cost surveys were mostly insufficiently prepared, and excessive qualification requirements reduced the number of potential bidders and restricted competition, particularly in the transport sector.
Prevention of corruption
The investigations have not been aimed at exposing cases of corruption,
This is also because the courts of auditors do not have the appropriate instruments to do so.
However, the audit courts can examine the extent to which the administrations of both countries have taken precautions against corruption and manipulation in the awarding of construction services and how these requirements are applied.
When it comes to preventing corruption, both countries have set different priorities.
In particular, the German regulations provide for largely unlimited competition, as well as transparency and controls as central elements of the prevention of corruption.
The Czech regulations are primarily aimed at increasing the transparency of the procedures.
BRH
In Germany, general principles of the prevention of corruption apply, which the entire federal administration has to apply.
These principles are also implemented in the specifications for the award of construction services and are geared to their specific requirements.
In some cases, the relevant regulations set out very precisely how the anti-corruption bids should be taken into account in the course of the award process and in the selection of the persons involved.
In the opinion of the BRH, in particular, the primacy of the principle of open procedure or public tender is a suitable instrument for substantially reducing the risk of corruption in the award of construction services. Restrictions on competition, on the other hand, increase the risk of manipulative interference.
Risk analysis and sufficient controls (in particular the multi-eyes principle), the requirements for transparency and documentation of procurement procedures, as well as various organisational measures, are also effective precautions to prevent corruption and manipulation.
The BRH therefore does not see any fundamental need for changes to the corresponding requirements of the administrations for the award of construction services.
The rules for preventing corruption are largely taken into account in practice.
The shortcomings identified in some areas have highlighted shortcomings in the implementation of some of the requirements.
The building authorities should continue to train their employees on the requirements for the prevention of corruption and make them even more aware of this problem.
A significant part of the complaints related to tasks that the building authorities had delegated to freelancers.
However, without controls and adequate safeguards, the risk of abuse increases when delegating tasks.
Manipulation and corruption-prone tasks should therefore only be assigned to third parties if the administration is able to guarantee a sufficient level of protection against undue interference.
NKthe
The Czech Republic has adopted an anti-corruption strategy at government level, in which the area of public procurement is the most important element.
The Procurement Act, as well as its implementing provisions, have been substantially amended.
The tests carried out by the NK were carried out during the implementation of this strategy.
The strategy adopted and the new legal provisions are likely to be effective improvement measures, since the contracting authorities must justify the cost-effectiveness of the orders, the calculation of the expected prices, the adequacy of the qualification requirements, the essential assessment criteria and the nature of the evaluations, and must properly document and publish all these aspects.
Recommendations
The NAC and the BRH are generally positive about the implementation of the EU guidelines.
The widespread acceptance in practice has confirmed that the EU's requirements of competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for the award of construction services within the European Union.
The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at facilitating and promoting cross-border competition.
In view of the enormous material and ideal potential for damage caused by manipulation and corruption in the award of construction services, both audit bodies consider that the building authorities in their countries are required to continue and, if necessary, improve their measures against corruption and manipulation.
In particular, the organisation and procedures of procurement procedures should be continuously examined for weaknesses and risks, in order to be able to identify the need for action and to take appropriate countermeasures.
The comparison of procurement practices in both countries suggests that the proportion of open procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased, as open procedures can provide a wider scope for competition and significantly reduce the risk of corruption.
In addition, a greater division of construction services into lots can have a favourable effect on the offer price, provided that it achieves greater competition with a higher number of bidders.
Ensuring that procurement procedures are carried out correctly is an essential basis for efficient awarding of contracts by public authorities.
In Germany, procurement procedures are carried out by the specialised construction authorities, while in the Czech Republic, these tasks - with the exception of transport construction projects - are carried out by the departments themselves or by contractors commissioned by them.
The audit courts of both countries have the concern to continue to develop the relevant findings for them, even after the completion of their joint project, and, if necessary, to bring them to the parliament and government of their country.
Both audit bodies are also convinced that the principles of public procurement law set out in this report and its implementation are also of interest at the international level of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), because the principles and findings set out are of general importance in order to effectively counter corruption and to ensure the economic award of construction services in a well-functioning and fair competition.

The Portuguese star striker "played the best match this evening along with the half-hour of Valencia," praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the record champion's 3-1 (1-1) victory against SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive star, even without his own goal, was the decisive man in the important match against the persecutor.
"Ronaldo has had a lot of fun and is doing well," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment on we've grown.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goals, Juve turned the game around after the early slip through the hit of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and, for the time being, suspended the most annoying striker.
The Real Madrid goalkeeper first put on former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who took the lead with a double pack (26-49).
And Ronaldo, after a corner with a headball, also did the preliminary work on the hit of defensive head coach Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who only had to push in just before the goal line.
"He gives a lot of templates," praised the coach.
But Allegri, of course, also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record goalscorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We've got to get even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
Best Juve goalscorer is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on his account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the superiority of Juventus seems to be becoming even more overwhelming.

Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offerings
The Evangelical Academy of Tutzing is offering around 80 meetings by the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signalled that he wants to pick up the tolerance prize in person in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, his term of office was too short: As Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
For example, academy director Udo Hahn credited him with saying proudly: "All the Federal Presidents and Federal Chancellor have already been with us." However, the fact that celebrities repeatedly appear at the Academy in Tutzing Castle was also a topic during the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, singer-songwriter Konstantin Wecker will take part in a conference on spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective; on 29 September, writer Frido Mann will attend a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has also promised that he will personally accept the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which in another category will also be awarded to TV presenter Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The 80 or so meetings up to mid-2019 have it in their own right.
"The pension is not safe!" Is the title of the conference.
"SOS on Europe's borders" - this is how the academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean."
"And to a meeting on Syria:" Barbarism Without Limit. "
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - the war mocks every humane idea. "
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society, to the gap between rich and poor, to the radical change in work through digitisation.

Music cabaret: Gender Understanding With Heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret artist, Teubner imagined gender understanding, not only with humour and heart warmth for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man, and what else might exist, but also with music.
She used the mini-guitar and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp was sitting on the wing.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes comes up with words until the end of the sentence, and on the other hand, a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner is so congenially harmoniously accompanied that some people may have wanted a solo.
That was also the case, with Beethoven and Chopin, but in a different way, as it suited the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had brought a paradox into play: The satisfaction of the man comes when he has a partner, but he does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, is of no use.
The piano solo is now demonstrating something of its own: What would have come out of Mozart's composing if "the Nannerl" had opened the door unexpectedly?
Thus Süverkrüp slips over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" into the "Song of Death," and from Mozart's G minor symphony into a playful dance.
There was a lot of applause and "Bravo" from the full room.
Flowers were handed over to Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the club, the chancellor.

Management of VAT in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Report on the audit
Foreword
Taxes are the most important source of income for public finances.
One of the focal points of the work of the audit courts should therefore be the examination of this area.
This is particularly true for VAT fraud.
This alone will result in annual tax losses of an estimated €100 billion in the European Union.
Already at the VI EUROSAI congress in Bonn in 2005, the participants pointed out the need for increased cooperation.
This makes it possible for the audit authorities, for example, to exchange audit approaches and to optimise the audit practice.
The value-added tax (VAT) is particularly suitable for cooperation, as it is harmonised within the European Union.
In 2006, for the first time, the courts of auditors of both states examined the UST at the same time.
The relevant audit report was published in 2008.
Since UST fraud is a widespread phenomenon in the European Union, there is a need for close cooperation between audit bodies, which will enable a comprehensive assessment to be made of whether the measures taken are capable of effectively tackling UST fraud.
The two audit bodies decided to continue their cooperation and carried out a second parallel audit. Management of the turnover tax in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany report on the audit

Examination number: (CZ) 09 / 11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892
Subject of examination: (CZ) Administration of the UST (D) Bilateral Audit with the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as NK), Audit
The aim of the audit is to:
(CZ) the UST administration and the treatment of selected transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic (hereinafter CZ) and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter Germany) should be examined. Furthermore, the procedures used by the financial authorities in the field of intergovernmental mutual assistance should be examined.
(D) The audit was intended to evaluate how the financial administration has implemented the recommendations made by the audit bodies.
In addition, further examination fields - linked to the UST - should be worked on.
The findings should be compared to determine whether tax procedures can be optimised.
The audit period was from 2006 to 2008, including relevant information from the period prior to the audit period until the completion of the audit.
2. Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel examination
The courts of auditors of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have agreed to carry out an audit of the administration of the UST.
In the previous parallel investigation, they had uncovered suspected cases involving intra-Community transactions,
Which made it seem appropriate to carry out a further examination.
On the basis of the audit findings, the two audit bodies made recommendations on the management of the UST.
The aim of the inspection was to evaluate how these recommendations were implemented, and to investigate the suspected cases identified.
The audit also looked at other issues, including selected cases of high-risk intra-community transactions, mutual assistance in the recovery of UST claims, and the UST audit of large companies.
In doing so, the Court of Auditors found that:
1. Recommendations made on the basis of the previous audit
• Recommendation 1: The rules for the registration of taxpayers should be harmonised within the EU
In the first audit, the auditors compared the registration procedures for UST in the two states and found differences that caused problems.
The Court of Auditors therefore recommended that the registration of taxpayers within the EU be harmonised.
This has also been taken up at EU level.
The draft amendment to Council Regulation No 1798 / 2003 provides for the extension of the current databases in the EU, including a database with the identification number of those who are required to do so.
The draft also provided for common rules for the registration of taxpayers and their possible deletion.
The Court of Auditors expected Member States to agree on appropriate rules to remove unreliable traders from the UST system as early as possible, in line with their decision in principle.
The Member States reached political agreement on the final version of the draft in ECOFIN.
The aforementioned common rules are no longer included in it, and the two audit bodies regret that.
They still believe that such regulations are important in order to prevent VAT fraud.
• Recommendation 2: Monthly submission of the Summary Reports As a result of the initial audit, the Court of Auditors recommended to the Member States that the Summary Reports (ZM) should be submitted monthly in the future.
The amounts of intra-Community sales could then be reviewed in a more timely manner.
Council Directive 2008 / 117 / EC amending Directive 2006 / 112 / EC on the common system of value added tax (VAT) for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions has reduced the deadline for the levy to one month.
In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by an amendment to the UST Act, which came into force on 1 January 2010.
In Germany, the implementation only entered into force on 1 July 2010, which means that it has not implemented the obligation to pay the zm monthly into national law on time.
• Recommendation 3: Data matching of the UST pre-applications and the ZM in Germany for more reliable MIAS data and a proposal to examine the merging of the procedures for UST pre-applications and ZM The German financial administration has taken up the recommendation issued by the Federal Court of Auditors and set up a working group to work out possible solutions.
The work has not yet been completed.
The Federal Court of Auditors will monitor the further development.
• Recommendation 4: Exchange on successful criteria, components or approaches to a risk management system at EU level In the course of the initial audit, the two audit bodies agreed that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by a Member State alone.
Successful criteria as well as elements or approaches to a risk management system must be exchanged and implemented in every EU Member State.
If this does not happen, fraudsters will focus on the Member State with the weakest risk management system.
The Court of Auditors found that the two Member States use different risk management systems, which have both strengths and weaknesses.
The NKU examined the system of information exchange within the EU - Eurocanet, while the Federal Court of Auditors focused on Germany's participation in the "Risk Management Platform."
2. Audit of selected intra-Community transactions
During the initial audit, the audit courts had jointly examined transactions in which it was doubtful whether they had actually been carried out or whether they had been explained differently by the taxpayers of the two states in the UST pre-filings (or UST declarations) or zm.
The audit courts selected nine cases of intra-Community deliveries of goods between the CZ and Germany for the inspection.
The audits by the financial offices (FÄ) of both states were not yet completed at the conclusion of the first parallel audit.
The audit showed that the tax procedures for these selected transactions have now been completed, and appropriate measures had been taken by the respective financial authorities to this end (including ex-post UST fixes or the prevention of pre-tax refunds).
3. Audit of selected, particularly high-risk intra-Community sales
The audit also included high-risk intra-EU transactions between EU taxpayers covered by the Eurocanet system.
Eurocanet is used to identify high-risk taxpayers.
Member States will be able to participate in this system on a voluntary basis.
The CZ is an active participant in Eurocanet. Germany has a passive status, i.e. it does not participate in the exchange of data within the framework of Eurocanet.
From the point of view of an active participant state, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to participate actively.
As a result, it was not possible to obtain information about which suppliers with German UST ID would have been classified as high-risk cases.
The NKU found both normal business transactions and those suspected of UST fraud, including carousel fraud, in the selected transactions.
The FÄ were only able to carry out limited checks on high-risk transactions, particularly in the case of so-called "missing traders," whereby an examination of the documents alone is hardly sufficient to prove fraud to the taxpayer.
Suspected carousel fraud in imports and exports
It is recommended that customs and tax authorities work more closely together in order to be able to trace the nuisance of goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final customer.
Germany, as well as a number of other countries, have rejected active participation in Eurocanet because, in their view, there is not a sufficient legal basis.
The Federal Court of Auditors found that the German tax administration uses other instruments to identify high-risk taxpayers.
However, there is a need for communication and exchange of experience between all EU Member States.
The Council of the EU agreed on a draft regulation,
Created by EUROFISC.
The experience gained so far with Eurocanet should be incorporated into the planned network for the fight against UST fraud.
4.Mutual mutual assistance in the recovery of claims
Intergovernmental mutual assistance in the recovery of claims is subject to the same European legislation in all Member States.
For this reason, requests for intergovernmental mutual assistance in the recovery of claims in the CZ and Germany will be dealt with in the same way.
The Federal Court of Auditors and the NKU compared the statistics sent by both Member States to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.
These statistics contained inconsistencies.
The two audit bodies believe that a renewed discussion on the statistics at EU level would be useful in order to avoid any remaining inconsistencies in the future.
If this does not happen, the statistics cannot be used appropriately for comparisons.
In addition, the statistics should contain more information about the UST.
An analysis of detailed data can make it easier for the Commission to support Member States in their efforts to combat VAT fraud.
Both audit bodies believe that Member States with a low recovery rate should strive to achieve at least the average recovery rate.
The Commission should support the Member States in this, if they so wish.
5. UST test for large companies
The auditors analysed the legal situation regarding the UST audit of large companies in both states.
In addition, they collected information from the financial authorities with a questionnaire, which they considered to be important in this context.
It was clear that the situation in both states is different.
The CZ has a system for selecting high-risk cases that includes a large amount of relevant data (including information on UST audits, balance sheet data, and profit and loss accounts).
As a result, the UST control can be effectively controlled and analyzed.
A special finance office for large companies is to be set up in 2012.
In Germany, there is no comparable system yet. This makes it difficult to control and analyze the UST control as a whole.
The German financial administration is focusing more on the selection of individual cases and is relying in particular on data from the UST pre-filings or UST declarations and the ZM.
Various risk management components, which are to be improved, support the evaluation of this data.
3. Examination procedure
3.1 Investigation proceedings in the Czech Republic
Department II - State budget receipts as well as regional departments IX Pilsen, X České Budějovice, XIII Brno and XV Ostrava audited between May 2009 and February 2010.
Audited posts were the Czech Ministry of Finance and 25 FÄ: Financial Office (FA) Brno II, FA Brno III, FA Brno IV, FA in Břeclav, FA in Domažlice, FA in Hodonín, FA in Hradec Králové, FA in Cheb, FA in Jablonec nad Nisou, FA in Karlovy Vary, FA in Kralupy nad Vltava, FA in Prague, FA in Ostrava, FA in Fa, FA
The Senate of the Czech Court of Auditors approved the findings of the audit on 27 April 2010.
3.2 Examination proceedings in Germany
The examination area of traffic taxes and employees of the associated PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt / Main and Munich audited from February 2009 to February 2010.
After selecting the sample cases, they announced that the test would be carried out in several countries:
• Bavaria, • Hamburg, • Hesse, • North Rhine-Westphalia, • Saxony. In addition, they conducted interviews in the Federal Ministry of Finance (Federal Ministry of Finance).
Tax records from the following FÄ were included in the audit: • Erlangen, Central Finance Office Munich, Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in Oberpfalz, Grafenau; • Hamburg-Nord, Hamburg-Hansa, Sonderfinanzamt Hamburg for large companies; • Wiesbaden I, Wiesbaden II, Darmstadt; • Essen-Nordost, FA Essen for tax audits at large companies and corporations, Lüdenscheid.
In addition, talks were held with the FÄ Mühlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Süd and the OFD Frankfurt / Main, Chemnitz and Münster.
The Federal Court of Auditors informed the Federal Ministry of Finance of the results of the audit in April 2010.
3.3 Cooperation between the two courts of auditors
In the run-up to the parallel audit, representatives of both audit bodies met in September 2008 to discuss and define the audit topics.
In December 2008, the presidents of both courts signed the agreement on co-operation in the parallel audit.
At a meeting in Bonn in June 2009, the examination teams discussed the initial results obtained during the preparation of the exam, discussed possible approaches to the examination and agreed on the way forward.
A second meeting took place in Prague from 2 to 4 December 2009.
The audit teams exchanged the audit findings obtained up to that point and agreed on the timetable for the preparation of the joint audit report.
The two audit bodies set out the following issues for their parallel audit: • Evaluation of the recommendations made in the previous report; • Review of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between taxpayers from the CZ and from Germany, which could not be fully resolved during the first parallel audit; • Review of selected intra-Community transactions between taxpayers from the CZ and Germany, classified as at risk; • Examination of the procedures of the two tax administrations with regard to the inter-governmental assistance of UST claims.
The report on the results of the parallel audit was prepared during a working meeting in June 2010.
4. Audit of the management of sales tax in selected areas
4.1 Implementation of the recommendations from the first joint audit
4.1.1 Implementation of the recommendations in the Czech Republic
Recommendation 1
Harmonisation of the conditions for the registration of taxpayers within the EU
In response to the results of the initial audit, the Czech Court of Auditors has recommended adjusting the requirements for VAT registration and introducing new rules for the deletion of registration in the CZ.
These amended rules should more effectively reduce the risk of potential tax evasion.
In certain cases, it was found that the FÄ did not delete the VAT registration of taxpayers if they did not comply with their obligations under Czech law no. 235 / 2004 (hereinafter referred to as the "UST Act").
So far, the Czech Ministry of Finance has not submitted an amendment to require the FÄ to be erased if taxpayers repeatedly fail to submit UST declarations.
According to the Czech UST Act, the FA can automatically delete the registration of a taxable person if (a) the taxable person has not made any transactions for twelve consecutive months and has not informed the FA of the reasons for this; (b) the taxable person has not fulfilled his obligations under the UST Act; (c) the taxable person no longer meets the requirements for the tax liability.
The first examination showed that, on the basis of the existing legal situation, the FA Prague 1 must delete the UST registration of "foreign taxable persons" 3 with effect from 31 January of the following calendar year, if they were not obliged to register and pay UST in the current calendar year.
The FA Prague 1 often did not delete the UST registration of these taxpayers because the relevant provision of the time limit could not be adequately implemented in practice.
The problem was solved by the amendment of the UST Act, which came into force on 1 January 2009.
According to this, the FA has the power to delete the registration of a foreign taxable person if, in the previous calendar year, he has provided neither taxable nor tax-exempt goods or services with the right to deduct VAT.
Recommendation 2
Monthly levy of the ZM
As a result of the initial audit, the audit authorities had recommended that the monthly levy of ZM be introduced.
The Council's directive, which shortened the time limit for issuing the zm to one month, was implemented in the CZ by the UST Act, which came into force on 1 January 2010.
The ZM must now be delivered electronically.
In addition, a ZM must be surrendered if services whose place of performance is to be determined in accordance with Section 9 (1) of the UST Act are provided to a person registered in another Member State as subject to VAT.
The condition is that the recipient is obliged to declare and pay the UST for these services, as required by Council Directive 2008 / 8 / EC amending Directive 2006 / 112 / EC as regards the location of the service.
Recommendation 3
Comparing the data of the UST pre-registrations and the ZM to increase the reliability of the MIAS data This recommendation referred to the German financial administration.
In its ATIS4 system, the Czech financial administration automatically compares data on intra-community transactions from the UST declarations and the ZM.
Recommendation 4
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level
The proper collection of the UST is an essential condition for the proper functioning of the EU's internal market.
For this reason, the fight against UST fraud is of primary interest and has received considerable attention in recent years.
The importance of this is evidenced, among other things, by a study published by the European Commission in October 2009.
In it, an external expert estimated the loss of VAT for the 25 Member States between 2000 and 2006. Based on the analysis of the available data, the tax loss for the aforementioned period was estimated at 90 to 113 billion euros, based on the fact that the EU-25 lose an average of 12% of the turnover taxes due to them each year.
The estimated tax loss for the CZ in 2006 was 18%.
The first audit found that a Member State could not develop an effective risk management system (RMS) on its own.
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each Member State.
In relation to the RMS, the Czech Court of Auditors has examined the system for the exchange of information within the EU (Eurocanet).
For this purpose, intra-Community transactions carried out by taxpayers within the EU and recorded in Eurocanet were selected (see chapter 4.3).
The aim of the EUROFISC network is to optimise mutual assistance in tax matters and to combat VAT fraud more effectively, and to improve cooperation between the competent authorities in order to identify fraud cases as early as possible.
Later, EUROFISC could be used as a tool to assess the risk potential of intra-Community transactions.
ECOFIN Council 6 already approved EUROFISC on 7 October 2008, and at the same time adopted the principles for the functioning of the system.
Eurocanet, developed by the Belgian financial administration in collaboration with the other Member States and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF7, serves as a model for EUROFISC.
The purpose of the system is to detect high-risk transactions and identify entrepreneurs involved in organized UST fraud.
4.1.2 Implementation of the recommendations in Germany
The assessment of the recommendations from the first report led to the following findings:
Recommendation 1
Harmonisation of the conditions for the registration of taxpayers within the EU
The German tax administration has developed a well-functioning system for registering taxpayers on the basis of a detailed questionnaire.
The Federal Ministry of Finance presented this system to the Commission in October 2007.
The system itself is constantly being improved.
The data provided in the questionnaire will now be collected electronically and will later be available for investigation, making it part of the risk management for registration.
The Commission had made a proposal 8 to amend Regulation 1798 / 2003, which included common standards for the registration and deletion of taxpayers.
There was still a need for clarification and clarification in the Member States.
The Federal Court of Auditors had recommended that the Federal Ministry of Finance should not fall short of the standards already achieved.
Recommendation 2
Monthly levy of the ZM
On 8 April 2010, a Bill 9 on the transposition of the EU directives into national law was adopted.
It includes, among other things, provisions on the monthly levy of zm for intra-Community deliveries.
It will enter into force on 1 July 2010.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of the data of the UST pre-applications and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and considerations for merging the previously separate procedures for submitting the UST pre-applications and the ZM
A joint federal-state working group has been set up.
Which has developed a concept for the automatic comparison of the data from the UST pre-registrations and the ZM.
The concept is still under discussion with the countries.
In addition, this working group has been working on a concept to optimise the control procedure for intra-Community transactions.
Recommendation 4
Exchanges of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level will be exchanged at EU level.
Germany is taking part in the risk management platform.
The European Commission supported the initiative and, by written procedure of 18 October 2006, initiated the establishment of a risk management platform within the "Fiscalis 2006-2007" action plan.
The members of the platform dealt with the following topics in four sub-groups: • risk management tools, • influencing the behaviour of taxpayers, • evaluation, • updating the risk management guide.
New reports from the sub-groups "Risk Management Instruments" and "Update the Risk Management Guide" were published at the beginning of 2010.
4.1.3 Evaluation
Registration
The question of the conditions for UST registration and its deletion in different countries has been dealt with at EU level.
The draft amended Council Regulation 1798 / 2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT and repealing Regulation (EEC) 218 / 92 provides for the extension of current databases within the EU, including a database of UST identification numbers.
This proposal also includes, among other things, common standards for the registration and deletion of taxpayers.
Registration and deletion issues are subject to the national legislation of the EU Member States until further notice.
There was still a need for clarification and clarification in the Member States.
The Federal Court of Auditors had advised the Federal Ministry of Finance not to fall short of the standards already reached.
The Member States reached political agreement on the final version of the draft in ECOFIN on 8 June 2010.
It no longer contains common rules for the registration and cancellation of taxpayers.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The two audit bodies regret this, and they still consider such regulations to be important in order to prevent VAT fraud.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Monthly levy of the ZM
With regard to international cooperation, as a result of the previous audit, it was recommended that all Member States introduce the monthly levy of the ZM in order to allow for an earlier assessment of the amounts of intra-Community turnover.
Council RL 2008 / 117 / EC amending RL 2006 / 112 / EC on the common system of value added tax for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions has shortened the turnaround for the levy of the corresponding ZM to one month.
In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by the amendment to the UST Act, which came into force on 1 January 2010.
Germany did not implement the obligation to pay a monthly ZM levy until 1 July 2010, and thus did not comply with the deadline, while the CZ complied with the EU's requirements.
Comparison of the data of the UST pre-applications and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and considerations for merging the previously separate procedures for submitting the UST pre-applications or the ZM
The German financial administration has taken up the recommendations of the Federal Court of Auditors and has set up a working group to develop possible solutions.
The Federal Court of Auditors will monitor the further development.
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level
Germany and the CZ are using different approaches to identify high-risk entrepreneurs.
The Czech Court of Auditors examined the application of the Eurocanet system in CZ (see section 4.3).
The Federal Court of Auditors focused on Germany's participation in the risk management platform.
4.2 Inspection of selected intra-Community transactions
During the initial audit, transactions were examined jointly, where there were doubts as to whether they had actually been carried out or whether there had been any inconsistencies in the reporting of taxpayers in both Member States.
The two audit bodies selected nine cases of intra-Community deliveries of goods between the CZ and Germany for the inspection, in which the tax examination by the FÄ of the Member State concerned had not yet been completed at the time of the previous joint audit.
1)
In the first quarter of 2005, a Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth €22,686 from a German taxpayer.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare the acquisition in his UST statement, in which the period mentioned in the German tax code did not have a UST identification number, but only a tax number for intra-German sales.
Through international mutual assistance in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the competent Czech FA had received information that, according to German UST law, the supplier of intra-Community goods does not need a UST identification number in order to be able to benefit from the tax exemption for intra-Community goods deliveries.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors found that, according to the audit carried out by the competent Czech FA, the Czech taxpayer filed an additional UST statement declaring the purchase of goods of the above value, while at the same time asserting his right to deduct the same amount of VAT.
2)
In the fourth quarter of 2004, a Czech taxpayer is said to have purchased goods worth €12,561 from a German taxpayer.
However, he said he hadn't purchased the goods and therefore didn't explain it in his UST statement.
The German financial administration, citing a provision of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, refused to process the request because the turnover associated with the acquisition did not exceed the threshold of 15,000 euros.
As the Czech FA was unable to obtain documents, the tax audit was inconclusive and the original tax regulation remained in place.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors found that the Czech FA received two spontaneous information from Germany in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, according to which the German taxpayer had charged the goods in question to a Slovakian addressee.
The Czech taxpayer purchased the goods from the Slovakian taxpayer and announced the acquisition in his regular UST statement for the month of October 2004.
3)
In the fourth quarter of 2004, a Czech taxpayer is said to have purchased a car worth €48,500 from a German taxpayer.
However, he did not declare an intra-community acquisition.
In addition, he had not made a UST statement since August 2004, which is why the FA set the UST at CZK 0 for the quarter in question.
On the basis of information provided from Germany in the course of the international exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the FA asked the taxpayer in March 2007 to make a subsequent tax return, which the taxpayer did not do.
The audit found that the FA had carried out further audit actions in this tax case in 2007, finding that the car in question had been sold by the taxpayer to a used car dealer in the CZ.
The Czech FA carried out an investment for the tax period of December 2004, imposing additional taxes of CZK 295 379 for the purchase and resale of goods from another Member State.
The competent Czech court decided to open insolvency proceedings over the assets of the Czech taxpayer; an insolvency administrator was appointed.
In the absence of significant assets, the outstanding tax liability is likely to be irreparable.
4)
In the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005, a Czech tax payer is said to have delivered new vehicles (passenger cars) to Germany for a total value of 198 167 euros.
In response to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, it was stated that a tax penalty case was pending against the German taxpayer in Germany.
The audit carried out by the Federal Court of Auditors found that, at the end of the proceedings, there was evidence that the German taxpayer was involved in fraud.
Intra-Community purchases of goods were subject to employment taxes of €182 424 (for 2004) and €369 690 (for 2005).
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors found that the Czech taxpayer was involved in carousel fraud involving new vehicles.
On the basis of information provided by the German tax authorities, a VAT audit of the Czech taxpayer has taken place for the tax periods April, May and June 2005.
On the basis of the audit findings and the information from the international exchange of information, the FA set an additional value of CZK 703 031 for May 2005 and CZK 726 551 for June 2005.
5)
Czech taxpayer A is said to have purchased a machine for a total value of €58,000 from a German taxpayer in February 2005.
In the third quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer is said to have delivered a machine worth €88,027 to the Czech taxpayer B. B, however, denied the acquisition.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors found that B had purchased the machine from a German company with a subsidiary in the CZ.
Czech taxpayer A did not specify the purchase of the goods from the aforementioned German taxpayer in its UST statement.
The German FA's response to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 showed that the German taxpayer had not made an intra-Community delivery of a machine worth €58,000, but rather a delivery within the CZ.
In the inspection, the Federal Court of Auditors found that the intra-Community delivery of the machine was classified as domestic delivery after the completion of an operating audit, and that the UST exemption was subsequently refused.
6)
In the third quarter of 2004, a German taxpayer is said to have delivered goods worth €11,600 to a Czech taxpayer.
The goods were purchased and later sold in Germany in 2005.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors found that the Czech FA had made its assessment on the basis of a supplementary UST statement, which improperly identified purchases from another Member State, including those in the above amount.
The Federal Court of Auditors found that after receiving a reply to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the German FA corrected the German taxpayer's UST statement and set an additional UST of €1,600.
Due to the resale of the goods in Germany and the corresponding UST investment there, an investigation is under way.
The ZM of the German taxpayer has not yet been corrected, as in Germany only the taxable person who has surrendered the ZM can rectify it.
7)
The competent Czech FA received a request for information from the German tax authorities in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 on the issue of the purchase of a car worth €47,400 by a Czech taxpayer in February 2005.
Following an audit for the 2005 tax period, the Czech FA fixed the tax liability of the Czech taxpayer at CZK 0 and informed the German FA that it could not confirm the purchase of the car by the Czech taxpayer.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors found that the registration of the Czech UST-required person had been cancelled because he had failed to comply with his tax obligations.
The Czech FA had sent the documents to the Czech police.
The German taxpayer has so far not corrected his information in the ZM, but has appealed against the tax ruling.
8)
According to MIAS10, between the third quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, a German taxpayer supplied a Czech taxpayer with a total value of €33,205, which he did not declare to be an intra-Community acquisition.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors found that the Czech FA investigated the reasons for the discrepancies.
For the first quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer repeatedly issued subsequent UST statements.
However, the Czech FA was unable to clarify the difference in the amount of CZK 134 273 in the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005, on the grounds that sales for individual quarters could not be accurately allocated, and accepted the UST statements made.
9)
In the third quarter of 2004, a German taxpayer delivered goods worth €46,854 to a Czech taxpayer.
For the same period, the Czech taxpayer declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only €14,856.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the Czech FA reviewed the actual value of the delivery.
With the German reply to this request, three invoices were sent, which showed a total value of the delivered goods of 31,998 euros, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech taxpayer and the MIAS data.
According to the results of the audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors, following repeated warnings from the FA in January 2007, the Czech taxpayer filed a subsequent UST statement for the tax period in July 2004.
With this statement, the taxpayer at the same time asserted his right to deduct VAT, and his tax liability for the tax period in question remained unchanged.
The audit confirmed that most of the tax procedures relating to the transactions selected for the audit had been completed and that the financial authorities in the CZ and Germany had taken appropriate measures (including ex-post UST fixes or the prevention of pre-tax refunds).
4.3 Examination of selected cases of high-risk intra-Community turnover
4.3.1 Results in the Czech Republic
Eurocanet can be an important source of information to identify high-risk taxpayers in the Member State of purchase.
In the CZ, the early warning information received from Eurocanet will be checked by the relevant FA with the purchasers.
Since the first quarter of 2008, the CZ has provided information on sales and taxable suppliers deemed to be at risk in the Eurocanet system.
Nine Czech taxpayers have been selected for the audit.
Which had been entered into the Eurocanet either as a supplier or a purchaser by the financial authorities of other Member States.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Since the German financial administration was not involved in the exchange of data via Eurocanet, it was not possible to determine whether suppliers with a German UST identification number were classified as risky by the German financial administration.
The audit found both normal business incidents and those suspected of carousel fraud or other UST fraud.
In the cases in question, the FÄ exchanged information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003,
For example:
• In examining the early warning information, FÄ did not identify any suspicions of high-risk sales.
The taxpayers in question were constantly monitored because their data was stored in Eurocanet.
• The FÄ failed to prove, on the basis of the accounting documents presented, violations of the rules on the calculation of the tax base and the UST, even though they found inconsistencies in the transport and storage of the goods or revealed business relationships with letterbox companies from other Member States.
• The review of individual business transactions was complicated because certain taxpayers did not cooperate with the FÄ and could not be contacted.
The responsible FÄ reviewed most of the high-risk taxpayers and turnover identified in Eurocanet's early warning reports.
However, their ability to verify risky sales, in particular so-called "missing traders," is limited.
In particular, a mere examination of the documents can hardly prove that the taxpayer is acting fraudulently.
Stricter requirements for registration of taxpayers for UST purposes and greater flexibility in deleting registrations would help to combat UST fraud.
Taxpayers involved in fraudulent carousel transactions can be registered for UST purposes in order to deceive fictitious deliveries of goods across the EU or to issue formally correct tax receipts to other taxpayers, with which they then make unauthorised claims for deduction of VAT.
In the case of suspected carousel fraud in connection with imports and exports, it is recommended that customs and tax authorities work more closely together to monitor the harmfulness of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final customer.
Member States will be able to participate in Eurocanet on a voluntary basis.
The fact that three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate was considered by the European Parliament at the end of 200811 to be a weakness of the system, which should be remedied by setting up a EUROFISC network with compulsory participation.
4.3.2 Results in Germany
The Federal Court of Auditors evaluated data available at the Federal Central Office for Taxation, including data from Eurocanet.
They served as the basis for the selection of six German taxpayers whose files have been reviewed.
Both Germany and a number of other countries refused to actively participate in Eurocanet.
That is why Germany has a passive status, which means that it does not send data to Brussels itself, but is only the recipient of Eurocanet data.
This is justified by the fact that "from the point of view of the Federal Government,
There is no clear legal basis that would allow the tax secrecy that exists in Germany to be broken.
In addition, the Federal Government does not have reliable insights into how information sent by the Member States is processed within the framework of Eurocanet. "12 Since October 2007, the Federal Central Office for Taxation has been evaluating the Eurocanet data and transmitting it to the federal and state tax authorities on the basis of a coordinated procedure.
The German FÄ will receive notification of the direct business relations of the taxable persons registered with them with companies from other EU countries, as recorded in Eurocanet.
However, the German FA does not receive any information as to whether the company from the aforementioned other EU Member State has business relations with a company based in another Member State, which is also in business with the German company from the control communication.
4.3.3 Evaluation
The CZ is an active participant in Eurocanet, while Germany has only a passive status.
From the point of view of an active participant, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to take part.
Accordingly, the examination in this area had to be carried out in different ways.
However, significant differences in the success of detecting UST fraud could not be established, due to the fact that Eurocanet is only one component of the risk management system.
However, the financial administrations of both countries have a variety of other tools at their disposal to detect fraudulent transactions, and yet it is necessary to develop a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.
The Council of the European Union agreed on a draft regulation 13, which created EUROFISC, a network to combat UST fraud.
The experience gained so far with Eurocanet should be shared and incorporated into the network by the Member States at European level.

The cases brought before the courts at national and European level show that there is a need for a discussion between the Member States and the Commission on the conditions for the exemption of intra-Community transactions.
4.4 Mutual assistance in the recovery of claims
4.4.1 Intermediate administrative assistance for the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic
The legislation on intergovernmental mutual assistance for the recovery of certain claims in the EU is essentially based on:
Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to measures that form part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as levies and duties;
Council Directive 2001 / 44 / EC amending Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as levies and duties, and with regard to value added tax and certain excise duties, and
Commission Directive 2002 / 94 / EC laying down detailed rules for the implementation of certain articles of Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures.
The CZ implemented Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC by law 252 / 2000 on inter-state mutual assistance for the recovery of certain claims.
Following the adoption of Council Directive 2001 / 44 / EC, this too had to be transposed into Czech law, and at the same time the aforementioned law had to be amended.
In this context, Amendment No 191 / 2004 on inter-state mutual assistance for the recovery of certain claims was adopted.
A new key piece of legislation was adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1179 / 2008 of 28 November 2008.
The attachments to this regulation contain new application forms to be used from 1 January 2009. Furthermore, the regulation makes electronic transmission compulsory and obliges the requesting authority to certify the conformity of all documents sent with the respective original.
The main principles of international mutual assistance for the recovery of claims are:
1. The principle of reciprocity applies;
2. Mutual assistance must always be provided only on request and if all conditions are met;
3. Mutual assistance does not extend to claims that are considered criminal sanctions in the requested state;
4. The procedure of intergovernmental mutual assistance for the recovery of claims must be carried out in accordance with the national law of the requested state;
5. In the recovery process, foreign claims do not take precedence over domestic claims;
6. Mutual assistance will only be provided for the recovery of non-contentious claims;
7. The principle of utilization applies: The requesting state must use all means available to it under national law to recover the claim.
Law 191 / 2004 provides for three forms of mutual assistance: The provision of information, the delivery of legal acts and the actual recovery.
Procedures for issuing requests to other EU member states
The competent FA has to send the request for information, the request for notification of legal acts or the request for recovery, together with the relevant documents, electronically via the respective financial directorate to the Ministry of Finance of the CZ.
The Ministry of Finance of the CZ arranges the translation of the request into the language in question, scans it with all the equipment and sends it via the communication network or the CCN / CSI joint interface to the competent financial authority of the state in question.
A request for recovery aid must meet the following requirement: The claim must exceed EUR 1 500 and must not be older than five years.
The requested authority can refuse recovery if the requirements are not met.
Procedures for incoming requests from other Member States
The Ministry of Finance must confirm the receipt of requests from other Member States as soon as possible, at the latest within seven days.
If it decides not to grant the request, it must inform the requesting authority of the reasons for the refusal, citing the specific provisions of the directive on which it is based.
The corresponding notification must be sent no later than three months after the date of receipt of the receipt of the request.
Upon receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance will examine whether the request meets all legal requirements.
It will then send the request to the relevant FA via the relevant financial directorate. If the request for recovery is granted, the FA will have to determine, among other things, the debtor's assets, for example, by extracts from the land register, information on existing bank accounts and registration of vehicles at the registration office.
At the end of six months from the date of receipt of the request, the CZ's Ministry of Finance is to inform the requesting authority of the outcome of the investigation.
The requesting authority must also be informed if the tax payers concerned are not reachable and the claim cannot therefore be brought forward.
All sums successfully contributed must be transferred to the requesting authority within one month of recovery.
The Czech FA dealing with the recovery may, with the consent of the requesting state, arrange the claim for hours or instalments.
The interest or surcharge imposed on the debtor for the period of delay, in accordance with Law No 337 / 1992 on the management of taxes and fees
Stand up to the requesting state.
In particular, in 2006 and 2007, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ delayed the receipt of requests for recovery to the relevant FA.
The same applies to the forwarding of the recovery requests made by the Czech FÄ to the competent authority in the requested state.
The audit found that the Ministry of Finance had breached the law on intergovernmental administrative assistance for the recovery of claims. It had failed to inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the state of play of the recovery procedure within six months of confirmation of receipt of the request.
The situation has improved since 2008.
Statistical data
In accordance with § 13 (4) of Law 191 / 2004, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ compiles statistics for the European Commission up to 15 March of each year, which includes the number of requests submitted in the previous year and the number of requests received for information, notification of legal acts and recovery, including the amount of the respective claims.
On the basis of the data provided by the Member States, the European Commission is preparing its report to the Council and the European Parliament on the application of the rules on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims.
The audit found that in 2008, the CZ's Ministry of Finance was underreporting the claims by €5250,000, due to incorrect information on the amount of a UST claim filed in 2008 (caused by the postponement of a decimal point in the conversion of the claim from Czech crowns into euros).
The error was subsequently reflected in the European Commission's statistics.
Information on mutual recovery assistance is shown in the table below.
4.4.2 Intermediate administrative assistance for the recovery of claims in Germany
The legal basis for intergovernmental assistance in tax matters is Council Directive 2008 / 55 / EC of 26 May 2008 (EC Recreation Directive) 14 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1178 / 2008 of 28 November 2008 (EC implementing Directive).
In order to improve readability and clarity, the EC Recruitment Directive codified Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC of 15 March 197616, the provisions of which had been substantially amended on several occasions.
It covers, among other things, the recovery of VAT and taxes on income and assets, including the associated interest, fees and surcharges.
The EC Recruitment Directive was transposed into German law by the Recruitment Act (EC) 17 of 3 May 2003.
The enforcement procedure in Germany is governed by the Tax Code (AO).
§ 117 (2) AO provides that the financial authorities can provide intergovernmental legal and administrative assistance by virtue of international treaties and the legal standards of the European Communities applicable in national law, as well as by virtue of the EC Official Assistance Act.
Part Six of the AO (§ § 249-346) contains the legal provisions for the enforcement procedure.
The administrative action of the financial authorities regulates, in particular, the enforcement and enforcement instructions.
The Federal Ministry of Finance reached an agreement with the representatives of the state's top financial authorities on the principles of mutual assistance in tax matters, and transferred its own competence in this area to the Federal Central Office for Taxation 18.
The general conditions for the admissibility of a request for recovery are:
• The legal requirements must be met (§ § 251, 254 AO).
• All recovery funds available domestically have been exhausted.
• The claims for which mutual assistance is requested are incontrovertible.
• The period between the issuing of the enforcement title or the date on which the claim or title became incontrovertible and the date of the request may not exceed five years.
• The claim must be at least €1,500.
Procedures for outgoing requests to other EU member states The German requests for the recovery of backdated taxes will be forwarded by the enforcement bodies of the FÄ via the competent central authority and the Federal Central Office for Taxation to the foreign authority concerned, such as the Czech CLO.
The details are set out in the leaflet on intergovernmental mutual assistance in the collection of taxes (recovery) of 19 January 200419.
This leaflet is currently being revised by a federal-state working group and is being adapted to the new recovery directive.
In addition to installations, the request will be forwarded electronically by the FA to the central authority.
The latter will check whether it is correct in terms of content and form.
If not, the request will be returned to the FA in question.
Otherwise, it will be sent to the Federal Central Office for Taxation.
The Federal Central Office for Taxation will then take over the necessary communication with the foreign authority in question.
Procedures for incoming requests from other EU member states
Requests for recovery from other Member States will be recorded in the Federal Central Office for Taxation, which will send a confirmation of receipt within ten days.
It is also examining whether the formal requirements have been met.
In principle, the Federal Central Office for Taxation passes these requests on to the central authority, which directs them to the relevant FA and oversees the execution.
The Federal Central Office for Taxation is also sending interim and final reports.
If the processing of a request takes longer than six months, it reminds the central authority of the obligation to submit an interim report in accordance with Article 16 of Commission Directive 2002 / 94 / EC.
After examining the formal and factual conditions for the admissibility of the request, the enforcement bodies will announce relevant measures.
All amounts contributed must be transferred to the bank account specified in the request within one month of receipt.
Statistical data
Information on mutual recovery assistance between Germany and the CZ for the years 2006 to 2008 (as of 31 December 2008).
4.4.3 Investigation of selected recovery cases
A total of 21 intergovernmental recovery requests between the CZ and Germany have been selected for the audit. Below are ten cases in which, among other things,
It found that:
1.
On 20 October 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German request for recovery of a Czech taxpayer's debt from 2004 and 2005 for a total amount of €3,883 (CZK 109,820).
It was not until 26 February 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the relevant FA.
In order to secure the claim to be paid, the Czech FA charged a property belonging to the taxpayer with a property right.
As the loaded plot was not enough to pay the entire tax bill, a payment agreement of at least CZK 2,000 per month was reached with the debtor.
On 31 August 2009, an interim report was sent to the German FA, according to which the taxpayer had, in the meantime, settled tax debts amounting to CZK 49 600 (as of 25 August 2009).
The amount was transferred to Germany. Shortly afterwards, on August 28, 2009, a further CZK 3,000 were transferred.
2.
On 7 January 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for recovery of tax debts (VAT, income tax) as well as interest and fees from a Czech taxpayer amounting to a total of €18,869 (= CZK 4,434,915).
It was not until 27 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the relevant FA.
After reviewing bank assets, securities, real estate, motor vehicles and other movable assets, the FA found that the debtor did not have any attachable assets.
Investigations on the ground also revealed that the debtor had been absent from his permanent residence for almost a year.
His whereabouts in the CZ were unknown.
This notice was sent to the Czech Ministry of Finance on 6 April 2009 and was forwarded to the German Finance Administration on 16 April 2009.
3.
On 21 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German request for recovery of VAT, along with interest and fees totalling €3,139 (= CZK 84 846).
It was not until 6 August 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the relevant FA. On 18 February 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance from Germany was informed that the Czech tax debtor had now settled the debt.
On 9 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance informed the Czech FA that the case had been closed because the Czech tax debtor had fully settled his debt in Germany.
However, the debt was also settled in the CZ as part of the recovery process and the corresponding amount was transferred to Germany on 27 October 2008.
Due to the length of time it took the Czech Ministry of Finance to pass on the information to the FA, the tax liability was paid twice - by the taxpayer himself in Germany and by means of recovery by the competent Czech FA.
In cooperation with the Federal Court of Auditors, it was established that the amount contributed will be offset against the tax liability from another procedure, amounting to €6,649, which was to be transferred to the CZ in September 2008.
In the documents of the Czech Ministry of Finance, there was only a request for recovery of €3,139 for the company in question, and the request for recovery of €6,649 could not be found there.
4.
On 15 September 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German request for recovery of income tax, VAT, interest and fees amounting to a total of €399,957 = CZK 956,654.
It was not until 19 December 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the relevant FA.
On 1 June 2009, the recovery procedure was initiated, and a decision was taken on the attachment of the Czech bank account and the debtor's salary (CZK 7 000).
During the negotiations with the FA, the debtor did not agree with the amount of the tax liability and the amount was contentious.
According to the Czech FA, the debtor had in the past been willing to pay 250 euros a month, but the German FA in charge did not agree with that.
The taxpayer agreed to discuss his case with the German FA in order to agree on a different amount.
The recovery procedure had not yet been completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.
5.
On 19 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German request for the recovery of income tax in 2005 and for the years 2003 to 2007, together with interest and fees totalling €11,444 = CZK 3,116 304.
It was only on 14 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the FA Prague 1, which has the power to deal with tax cases of taxpayers not resident in the CZ; on the basis of the available address, a local FA could not be determined.
In its investigation, on 19 September 2008, the FA received information and documents stating that the debtor's income was €4,704. However, it could not issue an enforcement order because the request for recovery had been received after that date.
On 26 January 2009, the Czech FA initiated the recovery procedure and issued an enforcement order attaching the debtor's assets to credit institutions.
The recovery procedure had not yet been completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.
6.
On 3 October 2006, the competent Czech FA requested intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of a UST debt, together with procedural costs amounting to a total of CZK 146 223 742.
It was not until 13 May 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the German financial administration.
On 8 September 2008, the competent German FA, through the Bundesbank, handed over to the Czech authorities the amount of €17,700 = CZK 439,226, which had been contributed by attachment to the accounts.
A conversion error was discovered in the verification of the amounts involved.
The amount of CZK 146 223 742 to be paid was converted to the exchange rate of EUR 1 = CZK 25,065, but a commuter error resulted in an amount of EUR 583 378.
The correct amount of the amount to be paid was €5,833,782.
As a result, a request for recovery, which was too low for €5,250,404, was made.
7.
On 1 March 2007, the competent Czech FA requested recovery on account of a UST debt, along with interest and fees from a Czech taxpayer totalling CZK 1 970 632 = EUR 79 847.
It was not until 10 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the German financial administration.
On 4 February 2009, the German FA asked the debtor to pay the arrears.
Taking into account the significant reduction in the company's sales in the second half of 2008, and in particular in the first half of 2009, and the corresponding liquidity situation, the following payments were made to settle the overdue tax liability: On 8 April 2009 - €4,600, on 6 May 2009 - €3,000 and on 16 June 2009 - €2,500.
These payments were transferred to the account of the relevant FA in the Czech Republic.
On 23 June 2009, a further payment of €2,500 was agreed between the debtor and the FA until 30 June 2009.
8.
On 22 May 2008, the competent Czech FA requested the recovery of tax debts amounting to a total of €398 653 = CZK 9 832 779, which included, among other things, property acquisition tax.
It was not until 2 October 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the German financial administration.
In a letter sent by the German Finance Administration to the Czech Ministry of Finance on 3 April 2009, the request was returned.
The German tax administration justified this by stating that the basic advertising tax is not a tax within the meaning of Article 2 (e), (f), (g) and (h) of Directive 2008 / 55 / EC.
In addition, Article 2 (g) deals with liabilities arising from taxes on income and assets.
Accordingly, Article 3 of Directive 2008 / 55 / EC applies to taxes on income and property, which are not mentioned in Articles 1, 3 and 4 of Directive 77 / 799 / EEC.
The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed to send a new request for recovery to the German financial administration, which should no longer include the basic tax arrears of CZK 61,759, but the arrears in the VAT, corporation tax and income tax.
The Czech Ministry of Finance has received a new request from the competent FA for the recovery of tax debts of the same taxpayer amounting to CZK 7 079 735.
9.
On 6 February 2006, the competent Czech FA submitted to the Czech Ministry of Finance a request for recovery of income tax and VAT amounting to a total of CZK 3 445 782 = EUR 123 328.
The UST debt was CZK 1 133 967.
It was not until 18 April 2007 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the German financial administration.
And it was only on 11 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance submitted to the Czech FA the reply of the German financial administration of 9 July 2007,
On 11 June 2007, the German FA issued an enforcement order for the attachment of the bank account, stating that the bank was not in a business relationship with the aforementioned taxpayer.
As a result, the request for the German financial administration was deemed to have been completed.
10.
On 26 September 2005, the competent Czech FA submitted to the Czech Ministry of Finance a request for recovery of UST debts totalling CZK 1 296 845 = EUR 43 591.
The responsible finance directorate submitted the request to the Ministry of Finance on 10 October 2005.
The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request to the German Finance Administration on 15 December 2005.
Before the request was sent, the Czech FA enforced the tax requirement by attaching the accounts to banks and payrolls, as well as by burdening a property.
Prior to the request for recovery, a request for information was submitted to the German financial administration on 16 March 2005.
According to the letter of reply sent to the Czech FA on 16 September 2005, the Czech taxpayer was resident in Germany and had income from non-permanent activities amounting to €8,437. On 20 April 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a reply to the request for recovery and did not forward this to the relevant Czech FA until 12 February 2008.
According to this, the tax liability in Germany is unrecoverable due to the debtor's inability to pay.
No property has been found to be the subject of other enforcement measures.
The German financial administration therefore considered the request to be completed.
4.4.4 Comparison and Evaluation
In the case of recovery, the requirements of EU law apply to all EU Member States for inter-state mutual assistance.
The procedures for processing requests are therefore similar in the CZ and Germany.
The Federal Court of Auditors and the National Audit Office have compared the statistics provided by the two Member States to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.
At the same time, there were inconsistencies.
In its report from 200620, the European Commission recommended that Member States draw up their statistics with greater care.
In 200921, the Commission concluded that, despite a larger number of requests for assistance, the discrepancies in the statistics have been reduced.
Both courts consider it useful to have a fresh discussion at EU level on the statistics, so that the remaining inconsistencies can be avoided in the future.
If this is not the case, the statistics are of limited significance and cannot be used for comparisons.
In addition, the Court of Auditors considers that the statistics should show both the annual number of requests and the type of claims (such as VAT, income tax) and the amount of amounts contributed per Member State.
Through a more detailed analysis of the statistics presented by the Member States, the Commission could help Member States to assess their measures to combat VAT fraud.
Since the recovery rate can be calculated per Member State, the audit bodies argue that Member States with a low rate should at least aim for the average recovery rate within the EU.
At the request of a Member State, the Commission could play an active role in this.
The foreign recovery requests received by the Ministry of Finance CZ were forwarded to the competent FÄ, in particular in 2006 and 2007, with a delay.
The same applies to the recovery requests made by the Czech FÄ.
The audit found that the Czech Ministry of Finance violated Act 191 / 2004 on intergovernmental recovery aid in so far as it did not inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the progress of the recovery measures within the six-month period from the receipt of the request.
4.5 Value Added Tax Inspection for Large Businesses
4.5.1 Value Added Tax Inspection for Large Businesses in the Czech Republic
Background
The tax procedure for large companies is subject to the same rules that apply to other taxpayers.
The audit of large companies is governed by Czech Law No 337 / 1992, the "Tax and Fee Administration Act."
The Czech Ministry of Finance defines large companies as natural persons who have set up a business or legal persons who have been set up to operate a business and whose net turnover for the tax period in question is at least CZK 2 billion, according to the income and corporation tax return.
The taxable person is classified as a large company on the basis of the level of turnover. Income or corporate tax return in the respective tax period; for the first time for the year 2003.
A natural or legal person is no longer run as a large company for the purpose of revenue taxation if, in three consecutive investment periods, their net turnover in the tax period is less than CZK 2 billion. The period begins with the expiration of the tax period, for which the conditions were met for the first time.
A taxable person can only be removed from the list of large companies if at least one type of tax has been checked beforehand for a tax period.
By the end of 2009, all large companies had been inspected at least every five years.
Since 2010, taxpayers have to be assessed in writing at least every two years, and the subsequent control measures are designed to eliminate the tax risks and their negative impact on the proper setting and collection of taxes.
The FÄ examinations should focus on at least one type of tax; they usually cover several tax periods.
The large taxable companies have been audited by the special audit bodies or audit services of the competent FÄ, which have been set up for a total of 13 FÄ.
A special audit unit carried out audits in its local area of responsibility in accordance with the guidelines of the head of the financial directorate.
In addition, she also examined:
Tax payers with unusual and special business activities, and
Those whose examinations required a high level of expertise and time.
Tax payers with complex location distribution and organisational structure will also be examined.
Taxpayers suspected of large-scale tax evasion
As well as taxpayers belonging to chains and networks suspected of large-scale tax evasion and unjustified deduction.
Information on the number of examinations carried out by the special examiners of the FÄ and the additional tax results of these examinations are shown in Table 3.
The Czech Ministry of Finance has submitted a proposal to amend Law No 531 / 1990 for the regional financial authorities. In particular, it is proposed to set up a special financial office with nationwide jurisdiction for selected taxpayers (legal entities established for the purpose of economic activity, with a turnover of at least CZK 2 billion).
4.5.2 Value Added Tax Inspection at Large Businesses in Germany
Background
The UST audit of large companies is not particularly regulated in Germany. General regulations apply to audits • the Tax Order (AO), • the Financial Administration Act (FVG) and • the Audit Code (BPO).
There are also work aids.
Tax ordinance
The provisions of § § 193 to 203 AO "Section 4 external audit" contain, in particular, rules for the admissibility of an external audit and its factual scope, distribution of responsibilities, form and content of the examination announcement, audit principles, tax payer's obligations to cooperate and requirements for final discussions, as well as for the transmission of the audit report.
External examinations are carried out by the competent FÄ (§ 195 AO).
According to Section 5, Section 1, No. 1, in conjunction with Section 19, it is the responsibility of the Federal Central Office for Taxation to take part in external audits of the FÄ.
The nature and scope of this involvement will be agreed between the authorities involved.
In addition, the Federal Central Office for Taxation can demand that certain companies it has named be inspected at a certain point in time.
In this case, it can lay down rules for the external audit of these taxpayers.
In accordance with Article 108 (7) GG, the Audit Regulation (BPO 2000) was adopted with the approval of the Federal Council.
It applies to external audits carried out by the state financial authorities and the Federal Central Office for Taxation.
According to Section 3 of the BPO, companies are regularly classified in size classes.
Large companies have to undergo a follow-up test (point 4.2 BPO).
In accordance with paragraph 33.1 of the BPO, each competent financial authority must maintain a group directory within the meaning of the regulation.
Work support for the administration
In addition, the following work aids have been issued for the administration:
• "Unified manual for the UST special examination";
• VAT-countries-online - USLO (= dialogue system in the intra-Community UST control procedure) with instructions on how to use the data contained in the MIAS on intra-community business relations;
• Work aids for difficult and special situations.
• Central database for the storage and evaluation of UST fraud cases and the development of risk profiles -ZAUBER;
Taxpayers are classified into size classes, based on criteria such as turnover and profit, with limits varying depending on the business.
The figures are published by the Federal Ministry of Finance.
The values will be reviewed every three years and fixed for the following three years.
The number of companies - not just large companies - is regularly recorded (last deadline: 1 January 2010).
In general, large companies are to be examined in full.
The examinations are announced and usually extend to the UST,
In other words, the audit covers all relevant taxes, namely income tax and corporation tax, as well as business tax and VAT.
The value added tax can be checked by either company auditors or UST special examiners.
The practice varies and depends on the administrative structure of the individual countries.
The number of tax periods covered by an audit usually varies between three and five years.
The BPO 2000 is expected to last three years.
The audit is subject to all taxes imposed on a company.
4.5.3 Management of Value Added Tax Examination at Large Businesses
According to the agreement, both audit bodies did not examine individual cases. They investigated the question of how the financial authorities proceed with the UST audit of large companies.
With the help of a questionnaire, they collected information from the financial authorities, which is essential for the audit of large companies.
• Which statistical records and evaluations for the UST audit of large companies are available to the management of the tax administration?
In particular:
• Are there statistics or records on the extent to which there is a distinction between UST fraud control and general UST testing?
CZ: No, the current version of the Atis system does not allow for such a distinction.
Germany: The financial administration does not differentiate between audits to combat UST fraud and general UST audits.
• Are there statistics or records on the timeliness of the examinations?
CZ: Information on the timeliness of audits of intra-Community purchases of selected UST compulsory users will be recorded in the Atis system;
The same applies to information about the start and end of the FA's audit.
Germany: No, the statistics for auditors compiled at the federal level only contain information about the so-called average final audit period (year).
This figure does not give an overview of the audit periods selected for individual companies.
UST special examiners focus on the last UST investment periods and are also authorised to inspect large companies.
The statistics for UST special examiners, conducted at the federal level, do not contain any information on the size of the audited company.
• There are statistics or records on the type of surplus result; for example, they are divided according to:
I. Real additional result (for example, application of a reduced rate instead of the general rate of VAT)
II. Incorrect additional result (e.g. transfer / transfer of an issue not to be objected to in terms of value added tax to another tax period)
III. Cash efficacy (payment of the fixed additional result)
CZ:
The Czech tax administration monitors the number of tax audits carried out, the amount of the additional tax result broken down by type of tax, the number of tax payers audited and the number of tax periods audited.
Other tax procedures (on-site investigations, reminders) will be monitored in the same way.
Regardless of this, the amount of repayments and receipts will be recorded.
Statistics on tax debts are broken down by type of tax, but there is no distinction between tax debts incurred as a result of a tax return and those resulting from audit actions by the FA.
Germany: No, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and UST special examiners do not differ according to the above criteria.
Even most financial authorities, where local surveys were carried out, did not differentiate in this respect.
• Will successful areas of examination be recorded?
CZ: Yes, the FA can select examination cases on the basis of criteria linked to selected indicators deposited in the Atis system.
Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and UST special examiners do not provide such information.
However, the federal and state finance ministries have agreed on a common approach.
According to this, auditors and tax investigators in the countries will have to spell out the additional tax result they have achieved if a certain threshold is exceeded.
In this case, additional information must be provided, for example, on the origin of the additional UST result obtained.
• What are the most common findings?
CZ:
- large taxable companies have unjustifiably taken advantage of deduction of VAT for related deliveries and services,
• which were not used for a business activity in accordance with Section 72 (1) CZ USTG;
• used for representation expenses in accordance with Section 75 (3) CZ USTG;
• due to invoices that do not comply with the requirements of Section 73 (1) CZ USTG
- Large companies subject to tax have failed to apply for VAT to be paid in accordance with section 21 (1) of the CZ USTG.
Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and UST special examiners do not provide such information.
Findings on the use of large-scale audits are not separately recorded by the countries.
However, the Federal Central Office for Taxation can evaluate the database of magic, in which auditors and tax investigators in the states have to enter the additional tax result they have achieved if a certain threshold is exceeded.
• Does the financial administration analyse successful audit fields and draw conclusions for strategic management?
CZ: Yes, for example, nationwide audits are carried out with regard to high-risk goods and industries.
Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and UST special examiners do not provide information on particularly "productive" audit fields.
With regard to the analysis of such information, its usefulness and the way in which it is continued to be used, there were differences of opinion among the survey bodies.
Some senior financial directorates provide such information to the FÄ, but it is up to the FÄ to decide whether or not to use it.
4.5.4 Comparison and Evaluation
As a result, large amounts of information are processed automatically in the CZ. Among other things, data from UST audits, as well as key figures from balance sheets, profit and loss calculations are processed in the system.
The CZ is able to control the selection of high-risk cases on the basis of a wide range of information.
The same applies to the evaluation and management of UST examinations in general.
The CZ is planning to set up a special finance office for large companies in 2012.
In Germany, the financial administration does not collect comparatively large amounts of data.
Accordingly, it is more difficult to carry out these tasks in the same way.
The focus is more on the selection of individual cases.

On the basis of the information in UST pre-applications or UST declarations, as well as audit notices, qualified examiners select the cases to be examined and ensure the correct taxation.
Appropriate management processes and risk management systems are to be introduced in order to reduce loss of revenue at the UST and, at the same time, to increase the risk of being discovered for unreliable entrepreneurs.

5. Conclusions
The cooperation between the two audit bodies has proved its worth.
In this way, it was possible to obtain necessary insights into the systems applied in both countries: This applies in particular to: • intra-community sales, • risk management at the UST, in particular with regard to the selection of risky sales, • recovery of UST claims and • UST audit of large companies.
The audit revealed differences in the strategies for detecting UST fraud and in the systems explained above.
These findings can be used to improve existing procedures.
They can also be used to spark a debate among interested parties on which audit approaches and anti-fraud strategies can be used, such as the relationship within and between Member States and the EU Commission.
The experience and insights gained should encourage us to continue to jointly examine the administration of the UST in the future.

From pure fruit farming to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle, the 125-year anniversary of the district association for horticulture and regional care was celebrated.
On 29 September 1893, with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the last founding impulses were set up for the Kulmbach district association for horticulture and regional care, and exactly 125 years later, he celebrated a big anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.

The purpose of the fruit-growing association also differed from today's work - in fact, it was purely about fruit-growing, and no one thought about flowers and horticulture at the time.

The district association stands for ecology, the beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district left no doubt about this, even district manager and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun.

Report on the results of the parallel audit of the management of the sales tax of the Czech Republic and Germany
Foreword
The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, emphasizes that the courts of auditors have the power to audit the entire public finances.
The statement calls for the courts of auditors to have the power to scrutinise tax collection as much as possible.
The Organisation of the European Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxes to be an important part of public revenue.
The thematic focus of the VI EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the audit of public revenue by the audit courts.
One of the most important steps on the way to optimising the audit work of a Court of Auditors is to develop a special strategy for the audit of public revenue.
This is particularly true for taxes, which are the largest source of public income with a high risk of default.
As national economies are increasingly interconnected and interdependent, a situation can arise in which national audit bodies can only carry out their audit work in cooperation with the audit bodies of other states.
As an example, the examination of internationally organized fraud can be considered, which can lead to significant loss of revenue in many states.
Cooperation between the authorities is required in the fight against such crimes.
Audit bodies in this area must be prepared to work closely with each other.
The idea for an audit of the turnover tax as well as the MIAS system arose at the VI EUROSAI Congress in Bonn, which was carried out in cooperation between the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Court of Auditors.
In the course of a thorough preparation, the participating audit courts first had to familiarize themselves with the legal framework and procedures of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and in Germany.
On the basis of the analysis of the available information, we made the selection of the subjects for the examination planning.
Achieving the efficient and effective management of VAT is a long-standing problem, and individual states (in particular the EC Member States) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify the collection of VAT and create greater transparency in this area.
We are convinced that the results of our audit can not only contribute to the improvement of the work of the financial administration, but also form the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international exchange of information.
Report on the results of the parallel audit of the management of the sales tax of the Czech Republic and Germany
Introduction
Reference: CZ) 06 / 27 (DE) VIII 2 - 2005 - 1215
Subject of examination:
(CZ) Management of VAT following the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union
(De) Examination of administrative co-operation in the field of value added tax in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and 1925 / 2004
The Commission's audit objective is:
(CZ) The aim of the audit in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedures applied by the financial administration in the area of turnover tax following the integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter "EC") with free movement of goods and services, as well as the use of MIAS1, in particular the control of the use of the VAT exemption for intra-Community deliveries.
(De) The aim of the audit was to examine the system of intra-Community VAT control, with a focus on mutual assistance in the area of VAT, in accordance with the above-mentioned regulations.
As a result of the audit, weaknesses should be identified and recommendations should be made to remedy them.
VAT information exchange system The audits were carried out jointly by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic ("NK") and the Bundesrech-nungshof ("BRH") of the Federal Republic of Germany, on the basis of an agreement concluded on 8 June 2006.
The focus of the cooperation was the review of selected business transactions between entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the exploitation of information obtained through international mutual assistance between the financial authorities, and the comparison of VAT management systems in the two states.
A joint final report on the results of the examinations was prepared in accordance with European Guideline 31 for the implementation of the INTOSAI audit standards.
The period under review covered the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005.
Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel audit
The parallel audit of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two audit bodies.
In addition to the focus on "exchange of information" under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and Commission Regulation 1925 / 2004, other closely related aspects have also been examined, such as the registration of tax evaders, tax returns and summary notifications.
In addition, the audit also covered the legal situation with regard to cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach and the comparison of statistical data.
When comparing the systems of VAT administrations in the two states, differences were found in the following areas:
1) Registration for the purpose of VAT.
While in Germany, entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among others, the essential criterion for registration is to exceed the turnover threshold set out in the VAT Act.
In the Czech Republic, tax evaders only receive a single tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, for the purposes of turnover tax, the person entitled to tax will receive a tax number that applies only to domestic sales.
If the German tax authorities want to make intra-Community transactions, they must apply for a special identification number, the so-called UST-IdNr., to be issued.
As problems arise as a result of the different registration procedures, the rules should be harmonised within the EC (see 4.1).
2) Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach.
In the Czech Republic, the cross-border carriage of passengers by bus and coach is tax-free, but there is a right to deduct the advance tax.
In Germany, as far as the route passes through Germany, the transport service is subject to VAT.
Efforts should be made at EC level to standardize the situation in accordance with Article 393 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of turnover tax (see 4.2).
3) Tax returns.
Whereas in the Czech Republic, tax receipts have to be filed only for lower-year tax periods (month or quarter), tax evaders in Germany (monthly or quarterly)
Pre-registration of sales tax and, after the end of the calendar year, an annual declaration of sales tax.
In contrast to the Czech Republic, tax authorities in Germany have to submit advance VAT declarations electronically.
The introduction of the directive on the electronic filing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of the Czech financial administration (see 4.3).
4) Summary messages.
While tax authorities in the Czech Republic are required to submit their summaries to the Financial Services (FÄ), German tax authorities are required to submit the summaries to the CLO2.
Accordingly, the FÄ in the Czech Republic will have access to the information from the summaries immediately after they have been submitted.
The information from the summary reports will only be available to German FÄ after they have been processed by the CLO.
In order to combat VAT fraud, up-to-date information on intra-Community sales is needed as soon as possible.
The monthly submission of summaries would shorten the period between the date of turnover and the update of the MIAS data.
This would allow for a timely review of taxation in the purchaser's Member State (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduce the same deadlines.
5) International exchange of information in the area of VAT.
In the event of requests for information, the Czech CLO will monitor compliance with the three-month deadline.
The German CLO does not monitor processing times.
As a result, the German financial administration has completed a significantly lower percentage of requests for information within the specified time limit.
Due to these problems, the BRH has recommended to the German CLO that the deadlines be monitored on a permanent basis (see 4.6).
6) Risk management.
Each of the two Member States is in the process of developing its own risk management system (RMS), with corresponding strengths and weaknesses.
The NAC and the BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by a Member State alone.
Successful criteria, elements or approaches of an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EU Member States. Otherwise, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5.).
As part of the co-operation, the two audit bodies examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions carried out between Czech and German tax entities.
Of these, 31 cases were jointly reviewed through the use of CLO's legal capabilities, where there were doubts about the correct taxation or suspicion of VAT fraud.
The Court of Auditors found that:
In some cases, the FÄ used the information obtained in the international exchange of information and re-established the tax liability of the tax authorities concerned.
In these cases, the tax authorities either unlawfully claimed the VAT exemption or did not disclose the purchase of goods in their VAT return.
In some cases, the FÄ could not use the information obtained in the exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used because of different legal provisions in the two Member States.
In some cases, the financial administration of another Member State refused to provide the information requested.
A number of cases have been uncovered in which tax evaders have misrepresented turnover in their summaries.
As a result, the data in the MIAS were correspondingly faulty, so that the staff (the FÄ) had to find out in these cases (see 6).
Examination procedure
CR examinations
The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by Division II - "State Budget Income" and the Territorial Audit Departments of Central Bohemia, North West Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.
The audited bodies were: The Ministry of Finance and the 10 FÄ Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadaň, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Třinec.
The College of the NK approved the findings of the audit on 23 April 2007.
Examinations in Germany
The audit was carried out between July 2006 and February 2007 by the Traffic Tax Division and employees of the associated PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt / Main and Munich.
It was part of the work plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006.
After a test phase, the actual test began in the fourth quarter of 2006.
In accordance with the cases selected by the BRH and later by the NK, the BRH had to announce the examination in several federal states.
In addition to interviews in the BMF and the CLO, the examination was carried out in the following federal states:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
Tax records from the following FÄ have been included in the audit:

In addition, talks were held with FÄ Augsburg-Stadt, Aurich, Düsseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.
The results of the examination were reported to the BMF in May 2007.
Co-operation between the two audit bodies
In the run-up to the parallel audit, a number of meetings were held between representatives of both audit bodies.
The participants in these meetings familiarized themselves with the organisation of the financial administration, the legislation on VAT and the system of VAT administration in each other's countries.
The subject of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006.
The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.
At this meeting, a timetable for the further procedure was drawn up and the following examination topics for the parallel examinations were determined: 1.
Registration of tax evaders.
2.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach - legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.
3. International exchange of information, in particular the handling of requests for information by financial officials and the review of selected problems identified in the requests for information, as well as spontaneous information between the Czech Republic and Germany.
4. Tax returns.
5.
Summary messages.
6.
Statistical information on deliveries and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany.
7. Risk management in the area of sales tax.
At a meeting in December 2006 to vote on the further examination of the NK and the BRH, both sides familiarized themselves with the examination procedure in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of the parallel tests that had already been achieved.

An entrepreneur with a legal seat, registered office or establishment in the Czech Republic, whose turnover in the last 12 consecutive calendar months exceeds the amount of CZK 1,000,000, will be eligible for payment on the first day of the third month after the month in which he has exceeded the threshold (§ 94 (1) of Law No 235 / 2004 Coll., concerning turnover tax; hereinafter "Law No 235 / 2004").
The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he has exceeded the registration threshold.
The current legislation does not allow for the retroactive registration of a tax collector if he has exceeded the registration deadline.
An entrepreneur with a legal seat, registered office or a business establishment in the Czech Republic, who provides value added tax services or benefits exempt from VAT with the right to deduct VAT, must register for the VAT even if his turnover does not exceed CZK 1 million, but he meets other requirements mentioned in Law No 235 / 2004.
An entrepreneur with a legal seat, registered office or establishment in the Czech Republic, who does not meet any of the requirements set out in the law, can voluntarily apply for registration for VAT.
The registration procedure in accordance with Law No 337 / 1992 begins with the receipt of the registration application by the local financial officer.
If you want to register voluntarily for VAT, you have to specify in your application the date from which you apply for registration as a value-added tax holder.
The financial officer must examine the information provided by the entrepreneur, i.e. the completed application for registration with all investments.
If he has any doubts about the information contained therein, he must ask the applicant to explain, supplement or substantiate the information provided.
If, by means of a review, the financial officer has established that the entrepreneur meets the conditions for registration, he must issue a written notice on the registration and allocation of a tax number.
In the communication, the financial officer has to indicate the date of entry into force of the registration for the value added tax and the investment period for the sales tax.
The investment period is the calendar quarter, unless the entrepreneur's turnover for the previous calendar year has reached the amount of at least CZK 10,000,000.
If this is the case, the allotment period is the calendar month.
An entrepreneur, whose turnover reached at least CZK 2,000,000 in the previous calendar year, is entitled to choose the calendar month as the investment period and must inform the financial officer of this change.
The issuance of a tax number in the registration notice is always constitutive.
The tax controller must provide the tax number for any communication (including payments) with the financial officer, and in cases where a special law requires it (e.g. Law No 235 / 2004, concerning the preparation of tax documents) 3.
The tax number contains the encoding "CZ" and a basic component in the form of a general identification sign.
In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or another general identification mark, as far as a specific law determines it. In the case of legal persons, the general identification mark is the company identification number (in accordance with the provisions of Section 33 (12) of Law No 337 / 1992).
If the entrepreneur has failed to fulfil his obligation, despite a request from the financial officer, the local financial officer has to register him on his own initiative.
A communication will also be issued on this subject, which will be sent to the tax authorities.
In the Czech Republic, every entrepreneur authorised to do business will receive a tax number on their first registration for any type of tax.
This also applies to registration as a tax payer.
According to Law No. 235 / 2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, in the event of non-compliance with the tax law for the registration of turnover tax, the financial officer may require that the tax payer should have registered up to 10% of the proceeds from the tax law, which the person concerned has made unlawfully without taxation, for the period from the date on which the entrepreneur was registered as tax collector, until the date on which the tax law was passed.
The payment of the amount set in this way is considered to be a tax payment within the meaning of Section 98 (3) of Law No 235 / 2004, i.e. it is not a fine or penalty.
If the legal requirements are met, the registration of a tax payer can be deleted for two reasons:
1)
Deletion of registration at the request of the tax collector, i.e. mainly for the reason that the turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (§ 106 (1) of Law No 235 / 2004).
A tax controller can apply for the cancellation of his registration at the earliest one year after the date of entry into force mentioned in the registration notice.
2) deletion of the registration on its own initiative (§ 106 (7) of Law No. 235 / 2004), if: A) the taxable person did not perform for 12 consecutive months and did not inform the financial officer of the reasons for doing so; b) the taxable person did not fulfil his obligations under Law No. 235 / 2004; c) the former tax person no longer meets the requirements for the tax penalty.
B) Tax persons without legal seat, registered office or premises in the Czech Republic A person who is registered for tax purposes in another Member State and in the Czech Republic has neither his legal seat, place of business nor establishment, or a tax-exempt foreigner who provides services in the Czech Republic and who, in accordance with Section 108 of Law No. 235 / 2004, has to make a tax return and pay taxes on these services ("non-resident").
He must submit an application for registration with the FA Prague 1 at the latest on the day of the delivery in question.
He is obliged to indicate in this application all the UST ID numbers assigned to him in other Member States or third countries.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration later than on the day of the first tax-sensitive service provision in the Czech Republic, the FA Prague 1 has to register him retroactively, as he became subject to VAT on the day of the first tax-sensitive service provision in the Czech Republic, according to Law No 235 / 2004.
In the event of a retroactive registration, the FA Prague 1 has to demand proof (invoices or written explanations) of the performance from the companies concerned.
If a non-resident entrepreneur requests registration in the Czech Republic before performing a service for the first time, the FA Prague 1 is required to submit the performance-based contract documents.
As of December 31, 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with the FA Prague 1, of which 124 were from Germany. As of December 31, 2005, a total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered, of which 233 were from Germany.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 106 (9) of Law No. 235 / 2004, the financial officer is entitled to delete the registration of a non-resident entrepreneur as of 31 January of the following calendar year if he does not accept the obligation to submit tax applications or declarations and to pay tax.
In the examination of the NK, it turned out that in the case of the submission of a tax return by post with dispatch abroad on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the mandatory deadline for the filing of a tax return, this declaration has not yet been received by the FA until 31 January.
In cases where these facts, which are relevant to the possibility of deletion of registration, become known to the FA later than on 31 January, it is no longer possible to delete the registration of the non-resident entrepreneur for VAT in the Czech Republic in the calendar year in question.
Registration of tax evaders in Germany
According to the provisions of the tax ordinance (§ § 137, 138 AO), all business operations must be registered with the municipality and / or the competent tax office.
This registration must be made no later than one month after the start of the business.
The municipality will forward the registration to the tax authorities.
If the competent tax office determines that a business activity has been started, but has not been notified, it can also register the tax authorities on its own initiative retroactively.
In Germany, tax evaders, regardless of whether they are resident or non-resident, are penalised for registering for Zwekke's sales tax if they meet the requirements set out in Section 2 of the German VAT Act (USTG).
This does not depend on the amount of turnover achieved.
There is no voluntary registration in Germany.
There is special responsibility for entrepreneurs based abroad.
For example, the FA ChemnitzSüd is responsible for those entrepreneurs who are based in the Czech Republic.
As of April 30, 2004, INSGE- and 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered; as of March 1, 2006, 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered there.
According to the BRH's findings, these FÄ, with special responsibilities, frequently refused to register so-called bogus self-employed workers resident in the new Central and Eastern European Member States of the EC.
Since the free movement of workers is still restricted following the accession of these ten countries to the European Union, these self-employed people tried to circumvent these restrictions by setting up their own business.
These (appearances) self-employed persons do not meet the conditions laid down in Section 2 of the USTG for recognition as entrepreneurs, since they are generally dependent on a single client who determines their working time and the way in which they perform their work.
In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must fill out a questionnaire from the competent FA and provide information on the company and the business activities carried out.
The questionnaire is a pre-print that is binding on all FÄ in Germany.
It will be processed either in special organizational units within the FÄ or in the organizational units generally responsible for the tax assessment.
With the help of this requirement, a risk assessment is carried out for the individual tax person prior to the allocation of a tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic sales is based on certain requirements:
The first three digits are the identification number for the responsible FA, the following three (or four) digits indicate which department is responsible within the FA, the following five (or four) digits are the identification feature for the controller, the last digit is always a control digit.
If an entrepreneur wants to take part in intra-community trade, he needs a UST-IdNr in order to be able to make tax-free intra-Community deliveries.
This will be allocated by the CLO on request if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany for tax purposes.
The UST ID number will be automatically allocated by the CLO if the tax person declares intra-Community deliveries in his VAT advance filings or in his annual VAT declaration.
The UST ID number is comprised of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.
The registration of an entrepreneur can be deleted: 1. On request (for example, if he ceases to do business), but only after the completion of all tax transactions (investment of all financial years) or 2. If the financial administration determines that he no longer runs a business.
As a rule, the validity of the UST ID number depends on the validity of the VAT number.
In these cases, the FÄ must inform the CLO of the cancellation of the VAT number, so that the validity of the UST ID number can be terminated there at this time.
According to the Value Added Tax Act (§ 19 (1) USTG), domestic taxpayers do not have to pay VAT in the following cases: 1. The turnover of the previous calendar year, plus the resulting turnover tax, has not exceeded the amount of €17,500 and 2. The following year will probably not exceed the amount of €50,000.
The so-called small business owners are not entitled to charge VAT to other entrepreneurs, nor are they entitled to deduct VAT.
Although they do not have to pay a turnover tax, small business owners are obliged to register with the tax office and make an annual VAT return.
A small business owner can explain the non-application of Section 19 (1) USTG.
This declaration will be binding for the next five years.
He is then allowed to charge the sales tax and deduct the advance tax.
Non-residents can appoint a fiscal representative (Section 22a of the USTG).
The prerequisite for this is that they only make tax-free sales and waive the deduction.
The fiscal representative meets the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur, so that he does not have to register for the purposes of the sales tax.
The accounts state that a fiscal representative has been appointed.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation in the two states is different.
While in Germany, entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, the first requirement for registration (among others) is to exceed the threshold set out in the VAT Act.
If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he can register voluntarily.
The registration process in Germany is standardized, but differences can occur in the individual federal states due to different organisational structures.
In the Czech Republic, at the time of its first registration, the person in charge of tax will receive a tax number for any tax.
In the case of his registration for the turnover tax, this tax number also applies to intra-Community sales.
In Germany, an entrepreneur who can register for sales tax purposes receives a tax number exclusively for intra-German sales.
If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-community sales, he has to apply specifically for the allocation of a UST ID number.
Both the NAC and the BRH found that the German two-step registration system in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which gives a single identification number for both national registration for VAT and intra-Community sales, could lead to significant misunderstandings.
On the other hand, the two-step system allows for retroactive (national registration) in cases where the tax payer does not register his business with the municipality or the relevant FA.
This retroactive registration allows for an accurate calculation of the value added tax for previous investment periods, in particular an accurate estimate of the value added tax liability.
As the different registration procedures lead to problems, the rules for the whole of the EC should be standardised.
The German parliament recently approved the introduction of a tax identification number.
This is to be allocated to every natural person after birth by the Federal Central Office for Taxation.
This number applies to natural persons resident in Germany for life.
If a natural person starts a business, the competent FA will apply for a commercial tax identification number, which serves as a UST ID number.
In the future, therefore, there should be no delay between the national registration of a tax payer and the allocation of the UST ID number.
Work on the implementation of an IT procedure for the management of the numbers has not yet been completed.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach
The legal regulations in the Czech Republic
According to the provisions of Section 70 of Law No 235 / 2004, since 1 May 2004, the carriage of passengers between the individual Member States and between the Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic has been exempt from VAT and there is a right to deduction of VAT.
The exemption from VAT also applies if the carriage is carried out by persons registered in other Member States as taxable persons or by foreigners who are subject to tax in their own country.
The return journey is considered to be a separate transport operation.
If non-resident entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic do not carry out any economic activity other than the cross-border transport of passengers by bus or coach, they are not obliged to register in the Czech Republic as subject to VAT.
Cross-border passenger transport in the Czech Republic has been exempted from the VAT requirement under the Act on the accession of the Czech Republic, Annex V, Chapter 5 (1) (b).
"For the purpose of applying Article 28 (3) (b) of Directive 77 / 388 / EEC, in accordance with point 17 of Annex F to the Directive, the Czech Republic may maintain the exemption for cross-border passenger transport, either until the condition of Article 28 (4) of the Directive is fulfilled or until the same exemption is applied by any of the current Member States."
The legal regulations in Germany
In accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006, as implemented in Germany by Section 3b (1) USTG, a transport service will be carried out where the transport is carried out.
Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and cross-border passenger transport.
Only the domestic part of the transport service is subject to tax in Germany.
German taxation also does not differentiate between resident and non-resident (bus) entrepreneurs.
If a non-resident person is transported through Germany, the part of the carriage, which originates in Germany, is considered to be a tax-free transport.
Before providing its services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must notify the competent FA of his intention to provide passenger transport services.
The latter registers it for tax purposes (compare 4.1.2) and gives a special certificate for each coach mentioned in the registration of the taxman.
The entrepreneur has to indicate his tax-sensitive transport services in a German tax return.
As of March 1, 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered with the FA Chemnitz-Süd.
If the transport service is provided for an entrepreneur resident in the country, the non-resident tax payer does not have to pay the turnover tax himself to the FA.
In its place, the domestic purchaser of the services must pay the turnover tax to the tax office and the net amount charged to the non-resident tax payers, which is known as the "transfer of tax liability" and is in line with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC.
In addition to the registration by a non-resident tax collector and his income tax return, the German tax administration has several means of verifying the correctness of the tax return with regard to tax breaks:
Mobile customs control groups are examining the certificates of buses registered abroad, which are used to transport passengers through Germany.
After each inspection, the mobile control groups transmit an inspection protocol to the relevant FA.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group can require the bus driver to pay the VAT before continuing his journey.
The non-resident taxpayer can deduct the value added tax paid in this way from the tax liability stated in his tax return.
If the FA has doubts about the accuracy of a VAT return, it can order an audit to be carried out by the FA, or it can use the means of mutual assistance referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 (see point 4.6).
Even if the foreign taxpayer refuses to pay the legally established turnover tax, the FA can ask for mutual assistance in accordance with Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC.
The BRH considers these means of mutual assistance in tax matters to be too burdensome in relation to the low cost of VAT on tax-sensitive passenger transport to check the VAT return or compliance with the tax penalty by a non-resident bus operator.
In particular, checking the books of a non-resident tax collector causes disproportionately high costs for the tax collector himself and for the financial administration.
The latter must examine the foreign books, which requires not only knowledge of the foreign language, but also of the foreign accounting principles.
Accordingly, such an audit can be expected to take more time than that of a resident tax resident, although the audit is limited to the number of passenger carriages taking place in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident taxpayer must accept not only the audit rights of his national financial administration, but also those of the other Member States, as far as he carries out passenger transport there.
In addition, for each Member State in which a single carriage of persons is carried out, the taxable person must comply with all existing tax provisions in the various languages and on the basis of the forms provided by the financial authorities of the relevant EC Member States.
As a result, the correct taxation of cross-border passenger services leads to a disproportionately high administrative burden.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation is different in the two states.
In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between different EC Member States, as well as between Member States and third countries, is exempt from VAT under the Act on the accession of the Czech Republic to the EC.
In Germany, the transport service is subject to turnover tax in accordance with the transport route that originates in German territory.
If a non-resident tax controller provides such a transport service for the first time, he must notify the relevant FA beforehand.
This registers the tax payer, who has to declare the tax-deductible portion of the transport service in a tax return in Germany.
Law enforcement in Germany is very time-consuming.
At least three out of four Czech tax authorities registered with the FA Chemnitz-Süd have passenger transport as a business purpose.
The amount of tax in question is quite low in relation to the administrative burden.
Member States - which collect VAT in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax - have a high administrative burden in relation to the relevant tax revenue.
In order to avoid the disproportionately high costs of investing in VAT, cross-border passenger transport should only be subject to tax in one Member State.
This could be the state where the carriage begins or where the service provider is based.
Such a form of taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006.
Sales tax returns
Filing and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic
To the extent that the law does not stipulate otherwise, even if no tax liability has been incurred, the entrepreneur will be penalised for issuing a VAT return on the pre-print provided by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the expiration of the tax period.
The tax liability arises at the expiration of the deadline for filing the VAT return. In accordance with law no. 235 / 2004, the VAT on the import of goods is excluded from this regulation. Here, the due date of the tax is determined by the customs regulations.
If, as a result, there is an above-average deductible advance tax claim, this amount will be refunded to the tax payer within 30 days of setting this deduction, without the need to make an application for it.
The time limit is not applied in cases where the financial officer initiates a tax procedure with regard to the tax liability of the tax payer.
In accordance with § 73 (11) of Law No. 235 / 2004, the right to deduct VAT can be asserted at the latest with the regular tax return for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the right to deduct VAT arose.
At the end of this period, the deduction can still be claimed within three years of the end of the tax period, during which the claim would have been possible for the first time.
In order to do this, however, it is necessary to submit a supplementary VAT return.
An amendment to Law No 235 / 2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, allows the filing of a supplementary VAT return only for the period during which the right to deduct VAT could have been invoked for the first time.
A tax collector must make a supplementary VAT return if: A) the sum of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax liability, b) he makes corrections that do not change the last known tax liability, but only change the previous information, c) he makes corrections to the turnover tax rate and the tax liability in accordance with § 49 of Law No 235 / 2004.
A tax collector can make a supplementary VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax liability.
The taxpayer must file the supplementary tax return by the end of the month, which follows the month in which the facts in question were established.
The sales tax declaration can be made electronically either via the Internet or by means of data carriers.
The delivery via the Internet can be done with a certified electronic signature or without it.
If it is carried out without an electronic signature, it must also be submitted to data carriers.
The preprint for the VAT return contains separate lines for the indication of the value of intra-Community deliveries and purchases.
The value of related services must be stated in separate lines of the VAT return.
Some headings are used for automated primary checks within the framework of the Atis system.
The value of the goods delivered to other EC Member States to persons registered there as subject to tax will be compared with the data provided by the Czech tax authorities in their summaries.
With the help of MIAS, the value of purchases of goods from other Member States from persons registered there as subject to tax will be compared with the information provided in the summaries of the tax authorities from other EC Member States.
Within the framework of the Atis system, the FA will carry out a credibility check of the VAT returns.
This is done automatically, as the VAT return cannot be processed without the prior examination.
The credibility test includes a calculation of the standards for credibility and an assessment of the risks of VAT returns.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 37 (1) of Law No 337 / 1992, the FA may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who do not comply with their non-monetary obligations under this or a special tax law or a decision under that law.
Automated tax information system - automated tax information system used by the Czech tax authorities to provide technical support for tax collection.
In its examination, the NK found that the FÄ rarely made use of the possibility of imposing a fine on the taxable person in question in the event of a non-payment of the VAT return.
Filing and processing of tax returns in Germany
In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly VAT pre-registration and the annual VAT return.
Those who are penalised for submitting VAT advance applications must nevertheless make an annual VAT return.
Even small business owners who are not hired to pay the VAT will have to make an annual VAT return.
The tax payers are, in principle, suspended until the 10th day after the expiration of the calendar quarter, in which the turnover tax is generated, to submit a pre-registration for VAT (§ 18 (2) USTG).
However, if the VAT debt in the previous year is more than €6,136 or if it is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur is penalised for submitting monthly VAT advance declarations no later than the 10th day after the expiration of the month in question.
The tax collector can also choose to submit monthly VAT advance applications if he has received a refund of €6,136 in the previous year (Section 18 (2a) USTG).
If the annual turnover tax is no more than €512, neither VAT advance declarations nor VAT returns are to be made.
A resulting VAT liability is to be paid 10 days after the end of the tax period.
A refund can lead to a more thorough audit by the financial administration.
There are no (legal) deadlines for the processing of VAT returns and for the refund of VAT overpayments.
In order to receive a timely refund, a security can be offered for the refund amount.
As a matter of principle, tax returns, including refunds, must be processed quickly.
The German VAT Act allows for an extension of these (surrender and / or payment) deadlines (§ 18 (6) USTG).
The extension of the deadline must be requested separately.
If it is granted, the pre-registration of VAT and the corresponding payments may be made one month later. However, in the case of monthly reports, a special advance payment must be made for this.
This payment will be offset against the VAT liability established for the pre-filing period in December.
If an error is discovered, the entrepreneur must submit a corrected VAT advance notification.
There is no "supplementary" tax return.
Once the VAT declaration to be filed by 31 May of the following year has been submitted to the tax office, the entrepreneur will no longer be able to correct an incorrect VAT advance notification, but only the incorrect annual VAT return.
Corrections to this VAT return to the advantage or disadvantage of the person in charge of the tax are possible within four years of the end of the year in which the first VAT return was made.
At the end of this four-year period, a VAT return can usually only be corrected in cases of careless tax cuts or tax evasion.
The tax authorities are required to submit the VAT advance declarations electronically.
The FÄ can grant exceptions to this rule in order to avoid undue hardship.
The annual tax return can be made in paper form or via the Internet, with or without certification.
If the levy is made without certification, the tax payer must also make the statement on paper and with his personal signature.
If no VAT advance declarations or declarations are made, the tax administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the turnover achieved by the tax payer.
In the event of a late charge, the tax payer can be charged with a delay surcharge (up to 10% of the tax liability or up to an amount of €25,000).
In an earlier audit, the BRH found that the FÄ often did not charge this delay surcharge.
In cases where the FÄ levied the delay surcharges, the amount was set unevenly and arbitrarily.
The delay surcharge therefore misses its purpose of reducing the average delay, particularly in the submission of the annual VAT return.
The preprint of the VAT return contains separate lines for information on the value of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions.
There are also separate lines for the purchase of services.
Non-taxable sales are to be stated in a separate line of the VAT return.
The VAT declarations filed on paper must either be scanned or electronically recorded by specially designated staff.
The data of electronically filed tax returns are directly available to the tax authorities.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
According to which all data are recorded electronically, they are subject to a risk management procedure and a case selection is made on the basis of certain standards.
The sales tax declarations selected in this way must be verified by the competent agent on the basis of the automatically drawn up inspection notices (see 5.2).
Although the financial administration only has to make a rough estimate of the value-added tax debt, it still has to be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, tax payers must submit their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the end of the tax period.
Depending on the turnover of the tax payer, the tax period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
In Germany, depending on the amount of their tax liability in the previous year, the tax authorities must submit their advance applications no later than 10 days after the end of the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
The annual VAT declaration must be made no later than 31 May of the following year.
The decision to issue an annual tax return has a number of advantages and disadvantages:
+ After the end of the calendar year, the tax payer can correct the errors in the monthly advance filings by submitting a single VAT return;
- if the tax authority corrects its information on intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be assigned to a specific reporting period of the ZM;
- The federal states do not match MIAS data on intra-Community purchases of German tax evaders until the annual sales tax declarations have usually been processed.
According to the registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs have to make a tax return regardless of the amount of their turnover.
This deadline will enable the German financial administration to verify compliance with the turnover ceiling for small business owners.
In addition, the competent FA can compare the annual VAT declaration with the corresponding declarations for direct taxes and with the annual accounts of the company concerned.
In the Czech Republic, the tax authorities can only check the level of turnover on the basis of the income tax declaration issued.
In contrast to the current regulations in the Czech Republic, German tax authorities are pilloried for the electronic filing of the VAT advance application.
The introduction of the tax bill for electronic tax returns in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech financial administration.
Summary messages
Submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic
In accordance with the provisions of Section 102 of Law No 235 / 2004, an entrepreneur who delivers goods to a person registered in another Member State for tax purposes must submit such summaries ("zm" below).
The value of the goods delivered is stated in the zm always in Czech currency, broken down according to the UST-IdNr7, the individual tax authorities under which they are registered in the other Member State.
Information on services is not provided in the ZM.
Tax payers with a calendar monthly or quarterly tax period will have to hand over the zm to the local FA at the latest on the 25th day after the end of each quarter.
Incorrect data must be corrected within 15 days after the error has been detected.
Faulty data in the zm will always be replaced by the data from the correction zm.
Similar to the tax returns, the tax authorities can also surrender the ZM electronically.
If a tax collector does not give up zm or rectification zm, even though he is penalised for this under Law No 235 / 2004, the financial officer must ask him to surrender the relevant zm and, in so doing, assign the consequences of the non-levy. If non-monetary liabilities are not met, the financial officer is entitled to impose repeated fines of up to CZK 2 million in accordance with Section 37 of Law No 337 / 1992.
In its investigation, the NK found that the FÄ mostly did not use their power to impose fines on their defaulting tax evaders.
In particular, in the case of the ZM levy, the tax evaders are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations, as the failure to levy a ZM does not affect the amount of their tax liability.
According to Section 102 (5) of Law No. 235 / 2004, the financial officer is obliged to check the information in the ZM or rectification ZM, to remove all ambiguities and to use the information to determine the tax liability.
If there is no agreement
8 of the information in the ZM with which The tax payer corrects false information in the ZM by submitting a correction ZM either on his own initiative or on request.
The financial officer will have to correct the data on the delivery of goods to other Member States in the Atis system if:
- the tax controller does not prove the accuracy of the information reported in the zm (or rectification zm) and therefore corrects it by issuing a correction zm,
- the financial officer has proved the inaccuracy of the information reported by the tax authorities in the zm or rectification rate.
Corrections entered by the financial officer, without a correction rate being issued by the tax controller, do not replace the tax controller's decision to issue a correction ZM, but only lead to the correction of the data in the MIAS, so that they are up-to-date, complete and accurate.
The data from the ZM will be sent to the Member States concerned.
Only the national financial authority designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the area of VAT is allowed to transmit and receive this data.
This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic, this function is carried out by the Department for International Mutual Assistance in the area of VAT in the Ministry of Finance), and the "O _ MCTL" message is automatically received by the CLO from the other Member States.
It contains all incorrect UST-IdNr., which were specified in the transmitted ZM-lines.
If the incorrect UST ID number is used in some of the transmitted lines of the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry will be made to the list of the wrong UST ID.
The list includes a "Notification of doubts regarding UST-IdNr."
The financial officer checks the data and enters the result of the review into the system.
When purchasing goods from another Member State, the tax collector must state this in his VAT return and enter the value of the purchase in the corresponding lines of the VAT return.
Selected cases of differences between the values of the purchases made by the Czech tax authorities in their VAT return and those of the supplier from the other Member State in its zm values for the delivery of goods will be passed on by the CLO to the relevant FA for examination.
The staff there will have to investigate the deviations.
There can then be three different situations:
A) The value indicated by the Czech acquirer in the relevant sections of his VAT return is lower than the value of the deliveries indicated by suppliers from other EC Member States.
In this case, the financial officer checks the accuracy of the information.
B) The difference is zero.
This situation can be caused either by a change in the information within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects its ZM) or by a change in the information in the VAT return (the Czech tax authority, meanwhile, makes a supplementary VAT return on its own initiative).
In this case, it is at the discretion of the financial officer to check the accuracy of the information contained in the VAT return.
C) The value of goods purchased from other Member States, as indicated by the Czech tax authorities in their VAT return, is higher than the value of their supplies reported by the suppliers of the other EC Member States.
Here, in turn, it is up to the financial officer to verify the accuracy of the information.
After reviewing the differences and clarifying the reasons for their occurrence, the financial officer gives the results of his review in Atis.
These results will be sent to the CLO.
For the individual quarters of 2005, the number of transactions sent by the CLO for examination can be seen in Figure 1 (Source: Czech Ministry of Finance).
Graph 1 above shows that the number of cases reported by the CLO has decreased for each quarter of 2005.
The significant reduction in the number in the fourth quarter of 2005 is due, among other things, to the fact that the Czech CLO has raised the threshold for a case selection, taking into account the minimum threshold for a request for information to the other EC Member States.
Differences between the information in the VAT returns and the data from the EC do not always have to be based on an error by the domestic buyer.
There may also be a mistake made by the tax authorities in another Member State, or an error caused by the fact that certain types of deliveries in the ZM are indicated differently in the individual EC Member States.
The most frequent reasons for deviations in the value of reported business transactions found in the FÄ examined can be seen in Table 1.
Submission and processing of summary reports in Germany
Traders who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EU Member States or take part in triangular transactions must surrender quarterly zm, in which intra-Community deliveries are listed according to purchasers (§ 18a (1) USTG).
The ZM must be delivered no later than the 10th day of the month following the calendar quarter in question.
If a long-term extension is granted for the submission of the VAT advance applications, this also applies to the ZM.
The ZM are to be handed over to the CLO.
Since January 1, 2007, the electronic levy has been punctuated.
The responsible FA can allow exemptions for individual tax breaks in order to avoid undue hardship.
If the tax payer finds that the ZM was faulty, he is paused to submit a correction within a month.
In the case of non-payment of the zm, the CLO initiates an enforcement procedure.
This includes the following steps: - first remembrance - second reminder, coupled with the threat that a penalty will be imposed and - fixing the penalty.
Although the German tax code allows for a penalty payment of up to €25,000 (§ 329 AO), the CLO sets penalties of €125, 250 and 500 in three stages.
In addition, Section 26a (1) No. 5 of the USTG determines that the tax payer acts unlawfully if he or she intentionally or lightly gives away a ZM not correctly, not completely or not in time, or if he or she does not correct a ZM or does not rectify it in time.
This infringement can be punishable by a fine of up to €5,000.
Data on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered into the MIAS by the FÄ, because the processing of the ZM is solely the responsibility of the CLO.
The data of the zm will only be stored with the CLO.
The information from the summarising messages will only be available to the FÄ after they have been processed by the CLO.
The deadlines for processing ZM are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003.
The ZM data must be stored within three months of the calendar quarter in question (in MIAS).
In the case of incorrect UST ID number in the ZM German tax authorities, the German CLO will receive a notification "O _ MCTL" from the other Member State.
The CLO then turns to the entrepreneur and asks for the correct data.
If the CLO fails to get the correct information, the case will be handed over to the relevant FA.
It is then up to him to ask for the correct information.
In the course of its audit, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs corrected the UST ID number at the request of the CLO.
However, the memory, as well as the threat and imposition of up to three consecutive fines, takes too much time when a tax evader may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.
The cases, which were eventually reported to the competent FÄ, were usually completed within one to two months.
The relevant FA refused to grant the tax exemption for the reported intra-Community deliveries in 73% of these cases.
If the taxman presented the correct UST ID number, the FA asked him to submit a corrected ZM to the CLO, because the FÄ cannot correct the MIAS data themselves.
The BRH found that neither the FÄ nor the CLO controlled the delivery of the corrected zm.
Therefore, the tax authorities often did not comply with the request. Since the CLO does not have access to the data of the VAT returns, no comparison is made between the information given in the VAT advance declarations or the VAT return on goods deliveries with the corresponding information in the ZM before these data are sent to the CLO of the other Member States.
This comparison can only be made by the FÄ, which is usually done in the preparation of a special VAT check.
Data received from other Member States will be processed by the CLO.
Incorrect UST ID numbers will be identified and reported to the affected Member States.
The data will be used to control employment tax in the FÄ.
As soon as they are available in the system, it compares the CLO with the data from previous calendar quarters.
If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control notifications will be drawn up and sent to the relevant FÄ.
This happens on an ongoing basis, whereas the acquisition data of all VAT holders is later compiled and forwarded to the FÄ.
The risk management system (RMS) for the investment process then compares this data with those for intra-community purchases.
The system checks fully (only) those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct the advance tax.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, tax evaders who have made intra-Community deliveries to a person registered for VAT in another Member State will have to surrender a ZM to the local FA within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter.
The FÄ process the ZM and transmit the data to the CLO.
In the case of FÄ, the values of intra-Community deliveries reported by the tax authorities will be compared with the values of intra-Community deliveries indicated by the same tax authorities in their VAT returns.
The results of the settlement will be taken into account in the framework of the tax setting.
In Germany, tax evaders who have made intra-Community deliveries are liable to pay quarterly interest within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter.
Since 1 January 2007, the tax authorities have been required to submit the ZM electronically to the CLO.
The data from the ZM will only be available to the FÄ after they have been processed by the CLO.
Both in the Czech Republic and in Germany, the tax authorities only indicate the deliveries of goods in the ZM.
The provision of services is not specified in the ZM. Unlike the Czech FÄ, the German FÄ cannot itself correct incorrect information in individual lines of the ZM issued.
Due to this limited access to the German MIAS data, incorrect UST ID number was not corrected even if the tax controller reported the correct UST ID number to the FA.
The German tax administration does not compare the information on intra-Community deliveries, which German tax authorities make in their VAT advance declarations, with the information provided by the corresponding ZM.
Differences between the data from the pre-registration and the ZM are not regularly revealed before the German CLO sends the MIAS data to other Member States.
On the basis of the BRH's findings, it is clear that a comparison would improve the reliability of the MIAS data transmitted.
The data provided by other Member States on deliveries of goods to Czech tax authorities will be compared in the Czech Republic with the data on purchases of goods provided by the Czech tax authorities in their VAT returns.
The Czech CLO makes a separate comparison for each calendar quarter.
The most serious cases of deviations will be referred to the FÄ for examination.
Unlike the Czech financial administration, the German financial administration does not generally examine the taxation of intra-Community purchases.
Such general control will only be carried out in the case of tax evaders who are not fully entitled to deduction.
In addition, the German tax administration only controls the taxation of intra-Community purchases by other tax authorities if the RMS has drawn up an audit notice or if the tax authority has already been selected for an audit.
This procedure relieves FÄ of the need to clarify the reasons for the differences that arise.
On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
In order to combat carousel fraud, up-to-date information on intra-Community purchases must be available as early as possible.
The current ZM system, in particular MIAS, provides financial authorities with information that may well be six months old.
This time delay could be reduced to up to four months if the tax payers had to surrender monthly zm.
The monthly levy would only increase the administrative burden insignificantly, since the majority of tax evaders in the Czech Republic and Germany are already obliged to submit monthly VAT returns or pre-filings, and for which no more information is required than for the VAT returns or advance declarations.
In order to avoid red tape, the levy of the zm could be linked to the submission of VAT returns or advance declarations.
However, a break with the monthly levy of zm would create more periodic discrepancies between the information on intra-Community deliveries and those on intra-Community purchases, and would increase the flow of data between CLOs.
In 2006, the federal government considered the general introduction of monthly zm.
The implementation failed due to the concerns of the federal states.
They feared that a monthly transfer of MIAS data to the CLOs of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In order for the allocation to the monthly levy to be effective, it is necessary to agree on the uniform monthly levy at European level, so that a monthly update of the MIAS data is possible.
Statistical information on goods deliveries and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany
In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.
The total turnover of intra-Community trade in goods between the Czech Republic and Germany is set out in Table 2.
Both audit bodies requested data on the number of false tax numbers or UST ID numbers in the O _ MCTL reports, which were exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for the individual audited quarters.
This data can be found in the tables below.
They have significant differences.
The reason for the differences can be a different basis for calculating the number of O _ MCTL messages.
While the Czech CLO refers the numbers to the calendar quarter for which the zm was submitted, the German CLO refers its numbers to the calendar quarter in which O _ MCTL reported.
International exchange of information at level 3
Implementation of the international exchange of information in the Czech Republic
The international exchange of information allows financial officials to obtain information from other Member States on intra-Community transactions as well as on the tax authorities who have carried them out.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 on mutual assistance in the field of value added tax, repealing Directive (EEC) No 218 / 92 (hereinafter "Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003"), distinguishes between two basic types of exchange of information: Exchange of information on request and spontaneous exchange of information (without prior request).
The international exchange of information on request is carried out through a request for information (Request for Information RFI) using the standardized SCAC form.
Financial officials in the Czech Republic are sending their RFI or their responses to a received RFI through the Financial Directorate to the CLO, which is concerned about translating the information provided in the standardised SCAC preprint into the foreign language and passing it on to the other Member States.
In addition, the CLO receives requests for information (RFI) from other Member States and the responses to sent requests. It is concerned about their translation into the Czech Republic and their distribution to the relevant FÄ for processing.
Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 sets a maximum period of three months from the date of receipt of the request for its processing.
All RFIs exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany during the audited period have been examined by the NK.
Out of a total of 94 RFIs received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were dealt with within the three-month period; in a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%), this processing period was exceeded.
In the remaining one case, no reply had been sent to Germany pending examination by the NK. More detailed information on the deadlines within which requests made by Germany were answered by the Czech Republic can be found in Figure 2.
Out of the total number of 335 requests for information (RFI) sent to Germany from the Czech Republic, a reply was received in 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) within the three-month period; a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were processed after the expiry of this period and, in 19 cases, no reply had been received from Germany (in the remaining one case, it was not possible to find out when the information was given).
More detailed information on the deadlines for responding to requests for information from the Czech Republic from Germany can be found in Figure 3.
The percentages of the values of intra-Community turnover stated in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Figure 4.
The chart above shows that the sales audited in connection with requests for information were mostly worth over €60,000.
The international exchange of information without prior request is either automatic, structured automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.
Financial officials from other Member States are often provided with information without prior request, which is important for setting the VAT liability.
In the Czech Republic, all information is collected from the CLO.
The exchange of information between the individual Member States takes place electronically.
"Automatic exchange" in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 means the systematic transmission of pre-determined information to other Member States at regular, pre-determined intervals without prior request.
"Structured automatic exchange" means the systematic transfer of previously determined information to another Member State, without its prior request, as soon as the information in question is available.
In the automatic exchange of information, the Czech Republic informs the other Member States about deliveries of new vehicles.
The financial officer receives this information from the pre-print notification of the delivery of a new vehicle in accordance with Section 19 of Law No. 235 / 2004, as well as from the copy of the invoice issued.
When processing this form, the financial officer inserts the required data into the relevant document template and forwards it directly to the responsible staff of the financial directorate, where this data is collected and sent to the CLO for further processing, after which these data will be transmitted to the other Member States within the specified period, namely within two months at the latest after the end of the quarter in which they were obtained.
The Czech Republic also provides information to other Member States on mail-order transactions that are tax-free in the country of origin, on intra-Community transactions that appear to be inadmissible and on potential "missing traders."
This information will be transmitted to the other Member States by means of an SCAC form in a spontaneous exchange of information.
Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany
In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information comes from the local FA.
The FÄ will send the completed SCAC 2004 preprint directly to the German CLO via e-mail, which will forward the SCAC pre-prints to the foreign CLO.
The FÄ are instructed to write their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the SCACpre-print used is unique.
Half of the German requests for information examined by the BRH were sent in order to ensure employment taxation in the other Member State, or to prove the tax exemption of intra-Community deliveries from Germany to the other Member State.
If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it will check whether the value of the deliveries mentioned in the request exceeds the minimum amount of €15,000.
If there is no reasonable justification for the request, the German CLO refuses to provide information on a turnover that is below the minimum amount limit.
In addition, the German CLO is concerned about the translation of the freely worded texts in the SCAC preprint [(B1-17) or (E)], if they are not written in German or English.
In response to the request for information, the CLO directs it to the relevant FA, referring to the three-month period.
No further deadlines have been set at the various levels of the German financial administration.
Although the German CLO has the technical means to monitor compliance with the deadline, it does not have the necessary staffing capacity to remind the FÄ to respond to the unfinished requests for information.
The FÄ will receive the information they need by writing to the tax authorities or carrying out an external audit.
The external auditors usually choose between two forms of audit: The VAT special audit, which covers all tax-sensitive transactions within a period of several months, or the so-called VAT review, which may only refer to a recent transaction.
In this short and concise form of examination, it is not necessary to make an announcement to the tax authorities, and it has proved its worth in the investigation of a single turnover.
In the case of the automatic exchange of information, Germany will provide the other Member State with the following information: - via UST-IdNr., which has been allocated to companies established in other EC Member States - on the refund of the input tax to traders established in other EC Member States.
In addition, Germany has agreed to provide the following information to the other EC Member States as part of the structured automatic exchange of information:
A. The delivery of new vehicles to entrepreneurs without UStIdNr., b. Distance sales (mail order) to other EC Member States, which are not subject to turnover tax in Germany, c. Significant deviations between the purchases reported by a tax authority and the MIAS data transmitted by other Member States, i.e. intra-Community deliveries of goods that have been improperly subject to taxation in Germany, have already been misused, or have been misappropriated by the Community.
Comparison and evaluation
The sending of requests for information or spontaneous information is carried out both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the initiative of the local FÄ, who transmit the corresponding SCACpre-printed information to the CLO.
While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCACpre-prints (Czech-English) and translates information provided into English or German, the German FÄ follow the instructions, requests for information or spontaneous information on a one-language preprint only in German.
The German CLO does not produce translations of German texts.
When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany in the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005, the NAC found that the Czech financial administration completed 74.5% of requests for information received within the three-month period, while the requests for information addressed to Germany were only completed in 40.6% of cases within that period.
Although the German CLO refers the FÄ to the three-month period, it does not monitor its compliance.
Due to the lack of memories, there is a high proportion of requests for information that have been answered for a limited period of time.
For this reason, the BRH has recommended to the German CLO a continuous process of remembrance.
The situation has now changed.
According to the information available to us, the German CLO is now reminding the tax authorities to respond to the outstanding requests for information.
Value-added tax risk management
Risk management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several organisational units at different levels of financial management are involved in risk management in the area of turnover tax.
Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organisational units are responsible for risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:
The Department for Methodology and Economic Management of Value Added Tax, or its risk management unit, is looking at identifying potential risk areas for tax revenue and evaluating trends in these risks in domestic and intra-Community trade.
At the national level, this body coordinates the criteria for "the credibility of VAT returns" and uses the MIAS data to detect potential tax evasion within the framework of intra-Community deliveries and acquisitions.
Based on data on the trade balance of the Czech Republic, it evaluates high-risk goods, prepares the risk management in the area of turnover tax conceptually and cooperates in this area with the relevant EC institutions and the other Member States.
The department for international mutual assistance in the area of value added tax provides, among other things, for the exchange of information, contributes to the creation and implementation of a relevant information database, evaluates the data available in the MIAS system in other Member States, carries out public relations work and is responsible for other forms of intergovernmental mutual assistance within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003.

The Tax Audit and Investigation Methodology Department conducts, among other things, risk analyses within the framework of the methodological management of tax audits, sets out priorities for the work planning of the financial directorates with regard to the selection of cases to be examined, compiles risk analyses to combat tax evasion and, in this context, collects information from the financial administration and other sources, and makes proposals for measures to combat tax evasion.
Tax investigators are in charge of the financial directorates. Their tasks include the search for tax evaders and industries that are at risk in terms of the frequency of tax evasion (e.g. internet transactions, gold, pharmaceutical industry), the search for unregistered tax evaders (e.g. in the sectors of internet services, employment services, electronic and print media, etc.), the investigation of misappropriation in the case of chain fraud.
Special examination units have been set up in 12 selected FÄ.
They have a regional competence and, on the basis of appropriate authorisation, carry out tax audits outside the local jurisdiction of the FÄ.
The need to set up the special audit units arose from the increase in the number of new and "improved" forms of tax evasion, particularly in the context of chain transactions.
These special units check according to the needs of tax investigators, or focus on tax professionals with specific activities, multinational companies, and tax professionals with particularly high turnover.
The following mechanisms for reducing the risks in the area of value added tax have been integrated into the Atis system: - the task of "credibility of VAT returns" to assess the risk of tax returns, - the task of "selecting the tax authorities to be audited," selecting the tax authorities to be audited on the basis of certain criteria - the task of "MIAS," which provides financial officials with access to the data provided by the other EC Member States.
The "MIAS" task allows, among other things, the following: - verification of the validity of the UST ID number of tax payers from other Member States, - confirmation of the value of the goods delivered to a Czech tax authority, as stated in the zm of all suppliers of the tax revenue from other Member States, tax returns from other Member States, tax returns from other Member States, and tax returns from those Member States, which have not been submitted to them, - formal control of the information in the tax information in the Czech Republic.
As part of their mission to fight tax evasion, financial officials have access to data from state authorities such as commercial registers, land registry offices, motor vehicle registrars, business registers, etc.
More detailed information on this can be found in section 4.4.1 of the submission and processing of the summary reports in the Czech Republic.
Risk management in Germany
In the Federal Republic of Germany, due to their federal structure, both the federal financial authorities (in particular the CLO) and the financial authorities of the 16 federal states are involved in the development and introduction of an RMS.
Although there are joint working groups for development, neither the CLO nor the financial authorities of the federal states have a fully unified set of data.
At the level of the CLO, the ST I 2 unit (hereinafter referred to as the "Kuss" - Coordinating Centre for Sales Tax Examining and Tax Investigation Measures) collects the audit findings on cases of fraud in the Opus database.
In cooperation with the countries, another database called Zauber was set up at the kiss, where the tax offices can enter and query the names of discovered missing traders or sales tax fraudsters.
The Kuss coordinates both related cases of VAT fraud at the national level and cases of cross-border VAT fraud.
The experience of the kiss will be incorporated into the development of the RMS through their participation in the working groups.
In addition, experts from several other organizational units of the CLO and the BMF are also involved.
The formal review of the composition of UStIdNr. of other Member States, which appear in the German tax authorities, will be carried out by the CLO.
This formal review takes place before the ZM is sent to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of the MIAS data and, therefore, its usefulness (see 4.4.2).
The validation of the validity in the so-called UST ID number is carried out on the basis of the O _ MCTL identifiers provided by the other Member States (for the procedure for correcting invalid UST ID, see also 4.4.2).
In addition, the CLO's RMS is based on MIAS data provided by other Member States and generates various types of communications to detect suspected missing traders. As evidence, certain features are used, which usually occur in carousel transactions.
The FÄ of the federal states are instructed to process these communications and have to forward the results of their investigations to the CLO in certain cases.
The BRH audit has confirmed that all available features need to be included in order to be sufficiently likely to suggest a case of tax fraud (rather than focusing mainly on a company's turnover).
Accordingly, the BRH has advised the BMF to work with combinations of different clues in the preparation of the messages.
The risk management system should also take into account other points of reference, such as the payment behaviour of the tax payer, the industry or the company's shareholding.
A second level of risk management exists with the financial authorities of the federal states and focuses on the processing of the VAT advance declarations and the annual declarations.
For example, the system compiles a list of those who have indicated intra-Community deliveries in their VAT advance notification or annual declaration.
This list will be sent to the CLO to monitor the full delivery of the ZM.
Furthermore, in this type of risk management, the purchases indicated by the tax collector in his annual tax return are compared with the data in the MIAS.
The financial authorities of the federal states avoid comparing the quarterly data, as these would result in too many inconsistencies due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud; for example:
- Supplier and acquirer are based on different dates for the execution of intra-Community turnover;
- Different accounting and tax declaration of Skonti and discounts.
In addition to comparing the information from the VAT returns with the MIAS data, many federal states have certain risk management mechanisms, which are based on information in the VAT returns and certain other indications (e.g. company wording, age of the owners / shareholders, number of employees and method of payment of the tax authorities).
Bavaria has introduced a rules-based risk management system that allows a team of tax fraud specialists (hereinafter referred to as "risk managers") to program their own rules in such a way that suspected tax fraudsters are singled out.
This system is used in the processing of the VAT advance reports by the FÄ.
As a result, the competent FA receives the advice of the RMS before the turnover tax is set.
As this system is not capable of learning, risk managers will have to adjust the rules according to the feedback from the FÄ.
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has developed an adaptive neuronal network based on the data of detected cases.
Based on this data, the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.
The system compiles a monthly list of tax cases where there is evidence of tax evasion.
On the basis of this list, the competent FÄ will decide on the audit of the tax authorities in question.
After the audit, the tax examiners will have to report their results so that the RMS can learn from the results of the tests it has proposed.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rules-based fuzzy system.
Based on a lot of data from processed sales tax returns and some other clues, this neuro-fuzzy system (also known as the datamining system) calculates how likely it is that a tax collector is involved in tax fraud.
It then compiles a monthly list of suspected tax fraudsters.
On the basis of this list, the FÄ select the tax authorities concerned for examination and report the audit results to the data centre in question.
The introduction of these three RMS is under way in the federal states.
Since each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three anti-fraud systems appears to be effective.
Whether the hoped-for effects will materialise in actual use remains to be seen.
Comparison and evaluation
Although it is not possible in the present report to deal with the specific criteria of the RMS in the Czech Republic and Germany, the NAC and the BRH have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.
As well as the different approaches in the three German states mentioned above, the RMS of each European state has its particular strengths and weaknesses.
At the moment, there is an exchange of experience between the financial authorities of the European Member States on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.
VAT fraud - in particular carousel fraud - has proved to be not a national problem, but a European one.
The people involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one but in several Member States.
A Member State cannot develop an effective RMS on its own.
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in every EU Member State. If this is not the case, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS for their crimes.
The tax losses caused by Europe-wide VAT fraud do not necessarily affect the Member State in which the initiator is based.
Any other Member State involved in the fraud may be affected.
That is why there should be a European exchange of experience on the RMS.
Selected results from the audit of individual sales In the context of the parallel tests, the NK and the BRH examined the quality and usability of information on selected deliveries and / or
Which were the subject of the international exchange of information between the financial authorities of the Czech Republic and Germany.
In addition, the two courts jointly examined the handling of several deliveries, which were in doubt about their execution, or which the tax authorities of both states explained differently in their tax returns, or at least in different ways.
At the request of the BRH, the NK investigated a total of eight business transactions between eight Czech and eight German tax authorities.
In addition, in 43 cases, on the basis of BRH communications, the NK examined the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany, which Czech tax authorities had stated in their tax returns and zm.
At the request of the NK, the BRH reviewed a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech tax evaders.
The relevant information was exchanged exclusively on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 on CLO.
The examination of the selected cases showed, among other things, that the different registration procedures in the EC Member States lead to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:
1.
According to MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax collector purchased goods worth €60,500 from a German tax collector.
When the Czech tax authorities declared an acquisition of only €29,869, the Czech financial administration sent a request for information to Germany in order to verify the value of the goods delivered.
In response to the Czech request for information, the German side stated that the German tax authority in question had delivered goods worth €27,381 to its Czech business partner in the second quarter of 2004, €31,997 in the third quarter and €10,276 in the fourth quarter.
Furthermore, it emerged from the reply that the UST ID number of the German tax authority was only valid from 28 September 2004. However, the German CLO had accepted a further request from the German tax authority and had brought forward the validity of the UST ID number retroactively to 1 May 2004.
The German tax watchdog corrected the zm.
On the basis of this information, it was a (intra-Community) purchase of goods by the Czech tax authorities.
In a request to the competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the NK found that, in 2004, the Czech tax authority had issued supplementary VAT returns for the individual (lower-year) tax periods in which it declared a higher value of purchases from other Member States, while at the same time seeking the deduction of pre-tax from purchases from other Member States.
On the basis of these additional VAT declarations, the responsible person in charge of the Czech tax office could not clearly determine whether the value of the deliveries of the above-mentioned German supplier was also included in the declared acquisitions.
In response to a request for information from the NK, the BRH found that the German supplier had been registered in September 2003 as subject to VAT.
At the time of registration, however, he had not applied for the allocation of a UST-IdNr., but only a tax number, which ultimately applies to Germany.
Although it is generally not possible in Germany to retroactively assign a UST ID number to a tax payer, in 2006 the responsible person in charge of the German financial administration did so retroactively as of 1 May 2004.
The German CLO grants a UST ID number retroactively if the deut entrepreneur has not caused the delayed allocation; for example, if the CLO caused the delay following a request from the tax collector to grant a UST ID number.
In this case, the CLO grants the UST ID number retroactively, because the entrepreneur does not require a valid UST ID number for an intra-Community delivery according to Section 6 of the USTG.
Conversely, a German acquirer does not need the (valid) UST ID number of its supplier to explain the intra-community acquisition.
Because of these procedural differences between the Member States, the German CLO issued the UST ID number retroactively in this particular case.
2.
As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech finance official asked for a review of the German entrepreneur's tax registration.
According to the MIAS data, the date of registration is 5 March 2005, while a registration certificate issued by the local German FA indicates 1 October 2004.
In their reply, the German authorities said that the German tax collector had been registered on 1 October 2004, but had not been allocated a UST ID number in Germany until 16 February 2005 for organisational reasons.
In a request to the local Czech financial officer, the NK learned that the financial officer had carried out a sales tax audit for the tax periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.
During this audit, the tax office found that the Czech tax collector had declared in his VAT return services to the value of CZK 9,897, which he had provided to the German tax authorities prior to their registration (i.e. before 1 October 2004).
The (Czech) tax office set a tax liability of CZK 1,880 for the third quarter of 2004 vis-à-vis the Czech tax authorities.
On the basis of the request from the NK, the BRH found that the German tax authority had only been allocated the UST ID number when it notified the FA of its company, which was founded in 2004, on 16 February 2005.
In addition, the FA retroactively registered him as of 1 October 200415 for the purpose of VAT, in order to be able to monitor the filing of the VAT return for 2004.
In this VAT return, the tax collector reported intra-Community purchases from the Czech Republic worth €160 (approx. CZK 5,000).
3. In its sales tax return for September 2004, as well as in its ZM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax receipt of goods worth CZK 114,615 was issued to a German tax collector.
When reviewing the registration of the German tax collector in the MIAS system, the Czech financial official stated that this registration was only valid from 11 November 2004, and therefore after the goods were delivered to Germany.
The Czech tax collector issued a supplementary sales tax return in which he declared sales from domestic deliveries of CZK 114,615 and sales tax of CZK 21,777, which he paid.
In response to a request from the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NK found that the Czech tax authority subsequently filed an application to reopen the tax procedure in respect of the supplementary VAT return. As evidence, it submitted a confirmation from the German tax administration that the German tax authority had been registered since 1 January 2000.
Accordingly, the Czech financial officer verified the validity of the registration of the German tax collector in the context of the international exchange of information.
According to the German information, a UST ID number was not allocated to the German tax authorities until 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.
As a result, the Czech finance official rejected the request to reopen the tax procedure.
The BRH found that, in this case, there had been no intra-Community purchase of goods, because the German tax collector had only received a UST ID number on 11 November 2004.
However, the German recipient explained both the purchase as an intra-Community acquisition and the value added tax on it, and also demanded the reimbursement of advance taxes of the same amount.
Because this did not lead to a change in the amount of the tax liability of the German tax collector, the German tax official did not correct the information in the VAT return.
Furthermore, the BRH found that the company of the German tax authorities named in the request for information was changed during the processing of the reply in Germany, which led to confusion between two German tax authorities.
This change in the name of the German tax authorities also confused the Czech finance officials.
4.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German finance official reviewed the purchase of goods in the first quarter of 2005 by a Czech tax collector of €22,686 from a German tax collector.
In a request to the local competent tax official in the Czech Republic, the NK found that the Czech financial officer had checked with the Czech tax officer during an external audit whether the intra-municipal delivery had actually taken place and whether the Czech tax officer had booked and paid the invoice for the delivery of the goods.
The Czech tax collector did not explain the intra-communal acquisition in his VAT return, because the German supplier did not specify his VAT ID number in the invoice, but only his tax number for transactions within Germany.
According to the MIAS data, the German tax collector will not be registered for the turnover tax in connection with intra-Community sales until 21 April 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech tax authorities.
The Czech finance official also requested that the German tax administration send a copy of the registration certificate of the German tax collector, so that he could initiate an appropriate tax procedure if necessary.
The Czech FA considered this business to be the purchase of goods from a non-business (private) person in Germany and therefore did not impose any sales tax on the purchase of the goods from Germany.
The BRH found that, under German law, a tax collector who supplies goods to other Member States does not have to have a VAT ID number for intra-Community deliveries in order to be able to claim the VAT exemption for such a shipment.
The supplier must only have the purchaser's UStId number in the other Member State and must be able to prove that the goods in question have been transported to the other Member State.
In this case, the turnover under German tax law is a (tax-exempt) intra-Community supply, which should be subject to employment tax in the Czech Republic.
In any case, it is important that the Czech financial officer took note of this business incident, because the delivery of a machine of this value was not part of the core business of the German supplier.
As described in Section 4.6.2, the German CLO rejects requests for information on intra-Community transactions if they are below the minimum salary limit of €15,000: 5.
According to MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax collector purchased goods worth €12,561 from a German tax collector.
The Czech finance official carried out an audit for this tax period.
In the context of intergovernmental mutual assistance, the Czech financial administration asked for the examination of this supply of goods by means of an SCAC form.
The Czech tax expert explained that he had not received the goods, had never been in a business relationship with the German company, and that the purchase of the goods in question had not been recorded with him.
The German financial administration rejected the request for the transfer of documents - contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents - because the turnover was less than €15,000 and no other justification had been given.
As the Czech financial officer did not receive documentation for a subsequent tax on the purchased goods, the tax audit remained inconclusive, and the original tax provision remained in place.
On the basis of a request from the NK, the BRH found that the German tax authority acted as a "fiscal representative" (§ 22 (a) - (e) USTG).
The German tax expert explained these deliveries in his tax return and in the ZM.
His right to a tax exemption has been recognised.
On the basis of the notification by the BRH, the German FA will send the documents required for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods to the Czech Republic.
In section 4.6.1 it was shown that the responses of the German financial administration to requests for information exceeded the three-month period more frequently than the answers of the Czech financial administration:
6. In the course of its examination, the NAC found that on 5 October 2005, the Czech financial authorities had sent a request for information on the value of Wa-rendition deliveries to Germany in the fourth quarter of 2004.
In the zm for this quarter, the German tax authorities had reported a shipment of goods to the Czech tax authorities worth €86,307; however, the Czech tax authorities only declared the purchase of goods worth €35,314 for the same period in their VAT return.
In response to the request for information received by the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after the expiry of the maximum processing period set out in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003, the German side indicated that the request for information could not be processed, since the German company had been dissolved at the end of 2005.
Because the German tax administration did not meet the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the documentation necessary for taxation in the Czech Republic.
7. In 2005, a Czech financial official, using an SCAC template, asked for a review of the delivery of motor vehicles to a German tax collector in the third and fourth quarters of 2004, worth €1,265,554, with evidence of carousel fraud.
The NAC noted that at the time of its examination, a German response to the request for information had not yet been received.
In a request to the local financial officer, the NK found that the Czech tax collector had not declared in his VAT return the delivery of new vehicles to these German tax authorities in the value of CZK 11,816,103.
The Czech financial officer corrected the information in the tax return, and the Czech tax officer issued a corrected ZM.
Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not pass on this request for information to the local FA for examination.
According to the BRH communication, a special VAT check was carried out by the German purchaser in Germany. It was found that the purchase of all the vehicles in question had been taxed correctly and that the vehicles were sold to other tax holders in Germany.
8. According to MIAS data, in the fourth quarter of 2004, the Czech tax collector purchased a car worth €48,500 from a German tax collector.
However, the Czech tax authority did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.
In a request to the local financial officer in the Czech Republic, the NK found that the Czech tax collector had not made a return on sales tax since August 2004.
The Czech tax collector did not make any tax returns even after being asked to do so by the financial officer. As a result, on 23 May 2005, the FA set the VAT liability for the period from October to December 2004 at zero.
On June 2, 2005, the CLO issued an instruction to examine the aforementioned delivery from the German tax authorities.
As the Czech tax officer did not cooperate with the financial officer, he sent a request for information on the above-mentioned delivery to Germany.
Since the reply to the request for information was only received on 7 February 2007, it was not known, until the conclusion of the examination of the NK, how the Czech financial officer used the information obtained in the international exchange of information.
As a result of the failure to comply with the provisions of the Czech VAT Act, the VAT registration of the Czech tax collector was cancelled with effect from 23 August 2005.
In some cases, only a partial word was sent because, at the time of the examination of the NK and the BRH, the relevant FA had not yet completed the external examination:
9.
In 2005, the Czech financial officer, using an SCAC template, requested a review of the delivery of motor vehicles in the third quarter of 2004 to a German tax payer worth €16,991, with evidence of carousel fraud.
In his response to the request for information, the German financial official stated that he only had the invoices for deliveries worth €16,335 issued by the Czech tax authorities.
On the basis of the request from the NK, the BRH found that the external audit carried out by the German FA had not yet been completed by the purchaser in Germany.
The German acquirer declared the purchase of goods worth €16,335 twice in its VAT advance filings for the months of August and September 2004.
10. In 2005, a Czech financial official, using an SCAC template, requested a review of the deliveries of motor vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005 to a German tax payer worth €198,167, showing signs of carousel fraud.
The German tax administration sent a partial reply to the request for information to the Czech Republic, in which it confirmed that the German tax collector had purchased several vehicles, and that the investigation in Germany had not yet been completed.
The NAC found that the local FA had carried out several external audits of the Czech tax authorities in order to check the deduction of above-average pre-tax rates.
However, an unauthorised claim has not been established.
The BRH found that for the period in question, the German tax authority had declared in its VAT declarations the purchase of goods from other Member States for a total value of €579,114, and that the examination of the German FA by the purchaser in Germany has not yet been completed.
Section 4.4.1 describes the reasons for inconsistencies between the declaration of intra-Community acquisitions in the receiver's VAT return and the information in the supplier's ZM.
In the cases examined, it was found that periodic inconsistencies 18 or the incorrect declaration of a turnover as an intra-Community supply of goods were not the most common reasons for the differences:
11.
According to data from MIAS, in the first quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth €35,716 from the German tax authority, but the Czech tax authority did not declare the acquisition.
Since the Czech tax officer did not cooperate with the financial officer and there was no business activity at the legal headquarters of the company, the Czech financial officer requested, as part of the international exchange of information, a review of how the German tax officer had communicated with the Czech.
The German response to the request for information showed that, according to the findings of the German tax administration, the Czech tax authorities were unknown at the given address and the goods were picked up by an agreed forwarder.
The total value of the order was €155,000, but the German taxpayer only delivered goods worth €21,659.
The Czech tax authorities sent the German tax authorities a false payment confirmation of the amount of €155,153 in favour of the German tax authorities.
After exposing the fraudulent behaviour of the Czech buyer, the German tax collector, with the support of his other Czech customers, managed to recover the delivered material, with the exception of a part worth €7,916.
In a request to the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NK found that, on the basis of the information received from the Czech tax authorities, the financial administration subsequently carried out, among other things, the sales tax on goods delivered from other Member States in the amount of CZK 388,522.
On the basis of a request from the NK, the BRH confirmed that, following corrections, the German supplier had only reported a shipment of goods to the Czech tax authorities worth €7,916.
In accordance with German legislation, the German tax authority declared the cancellation of the delivery and the reduction of the tax base in the quarter of the cancellation.
His ZM contained the following information concerning the Czech tax authorities:
12.
In the context of the international exchange of information, the German financial administration requested, by means of a SCACpreprint, a review of the supply of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005.
According to the request for information, during the period in question, the Czech tax collector had delivered goods worth a total of €396,126 to the German tax authorities and provided services worth €11,885.
The NK found that the Czech financial administration had carried out an audit with the Czech tax authorities in order to investigate this delivery.
In response to the request for information, the Czech financial administration announced that the Czech tax authorities had supplied and assembled a production plant for the German.
The Czech controller delivered the individual parts of the production plant before the Czech Republic joined the EC, and the production plant was assembled on the basis of the order after May 1, 2004.
The German tax collector did not take down the assembled production plant and claimed defects.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech tax authority charged the German production facility for €107,100 and €11,885 for services.
The German tax collector received the receipts, but did not recognise them and did not pay them.
In a request to the local financial officer in the Czech Republic, the NK found that all invoices on the books of the Czech tax collector had been duly recorded.
The sales tax returns for the third quarter of 2005 contained only the amounts documented by the Czech tax authorities, which related to invoices invoiced after the first of May 2004.
The BRH found that, on the basis of the reply from the Czech financial administration, the local FA concluded that these transactions were a uniform (goods) delivery of the Czech tax payer to the German, including the assembly carried out.
In this particular case, the place of performance of this so-called factory delivery is the place where the production plant is assembled.
The German recipient of the work supply owes the sales tax in accordance with the German VAT Act.
At the same time, the recipient can claim a deduction of the same amount.
As the turnover liability of the German tax authorities remained unchanged, the German FA did not request a correction of the VAT return.
13. According to the MIAS data, in February 2005, Czech tax collector A purchased a machine worth €58,000 from the German tax collector C.
The Czech finance official sent a request to Germany for a review of this information.
In response to the request for information, the German side announced that the German tax authority C had delivered this machine to the Czech tax authority B in 2004, but that it had returned it to the German tax authority C in October 2004.
According to information provided by the German financial administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but to the branch of the German tax authority C in the Czech Republic.
In response to the request for information, it also emerged that in February 2005, the German tax authority C had delivered the machine to the Czech tax authority A.
He picked up the machine at the headquarters of the German tax office in the Czech Republic.
As this delivery (from C to A) took place only within the Czech Republic, there was no internal supply of goods.
In a request to the local financial officer responsible for the tax case B, the NAC found that, according to MIAS data, the German tax authority C had delivered €88,027 worth of goods (another machine) to the Czech tax authorities in the third quarter of 2004.
Tax officer B said he had not received the goods, so the local Czech finance official sent a request for information to Germany.
The answer was that the machine had been delivered.
In the course of further investigations with the tax authority B, the financial officer found that the machine, worth €88,027, had not been recorded with the tax authority B and that it could be the same type of machine that the branch of the German tax authority C had delivered to the Czech tax authority A in February 2005.
The NAC also found that the Czech financial officer responsible for tax liability A had carried out an audit on the latter.
The financial officer had the invoice of the German tax authority C of 7 February 2005, in which the tax authority A is indicated as the receiver of the machine.
The Czech finance official noted that the tax-payer A had not recorded the bill.
The taxman A had signed a lease agreement with another Czech company, the subject of which was a machine of the same kind.
The leasing company delivered the machine on 9 February 2005 and also took care of the transport.
The Czech FA did not use the information provided in the reply to the request for information to determine the tax liability of the tax collector.
The BRH found that the German tax authority C had delivered the machine, worth €88,027, not to the Czech Republic, but to another German tax authority D.
Accordingly, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods, but a tax-free delivery within Germany.
As a result, the German finance official did not recognise the claim of the German tax authority C for VAT exemption and corrected the information in its tax return.
The German tax controller D delivered the machine to the Czech tax controller B.
According to German law, this shipment was not subject to tax in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.
The BRH also found that, in its ZM for the first quarter of 2005, the German tax authority C had indicated the delivery of a machine worth €58,000 to the Czech tax authority A.
This delivery was not verified during the tax audit carried out by the German FA.
The figure below represents the contractual relationship between the business partners involved in the above-mentioned transactions.
14.
When examining requests for information received, the NK found that, on 4 October 2005, the Czech tax administration had received a request for information from Germany, in which a German financial official requested the inspection of intra-Community deliveries of €879,680,625 to a Czech tax collector.
The German finance official said that there was a suspicion that this was a frenzied intra-community supply of goods.
The German tax collector has not carried out any active business activity since 1999.
The NAC found that the Czech financial officer had carried out an external audit of the Czech tax authorities.
The head of the Czech company explained that this was probably a claim made by the German tax authorities against the German tax authorities, which the Czech tax authorities had asserted as a shareholder in the German company to the German FA.
According to the information provided to the NK, the Czech financial official has not yet been informed that the German financial administration is handling the case with regard to the Czech tax authorities.
It is clear from the available information that this was not a delivery of goods; nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored in the MIAS as an intra-Community delivery of goods from Germany to a Czech tax collector.
The main reason for these inconsistencies was the failure to disclose the intra-Community acquisition in the tax returns of the recipients (see section 4.4.1):
15. According to MIAS data, in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005, a German tax collector supplied a Czech tax receiver with a total value of €33,205.
However, the Czech tax authority did not declare the intra-Community acquisition.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech finance official asked for an examination of the delivery of goods from Germany.
In its response to this request for information, the German side stated that the German tax collector had dispatched part of the goods to the address of the Czech tax collector, and that he had personally picked up the remaining goods.
In response to a request from the local Czech tax official, the NK stated that, prior to receiving a reply to the request for information, the Czech tax authority had issued an additional VAT return for the period in question.
Nevertheless, the differences in the value of the purchases could not be clarified, so the Czech financial officer recommended a tax audit with the Czech tax authorities.
This examination has not yet been carried out.
16. According to the MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004, a German tax collector had delivered goods worth €46,854 to a Czech tax collector.
For the same period, a Czech tax collector declared the intra-EU purchase of goods worth only €14,856.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech financial official asked for a review of the actual value of the delivery.
With the German reply to this request, three invoices were sent, which showed a total value of the delivered goods of €31,999, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech tax authorities and the MIAS data.
In a request to the local Czech financial officer, the NAC stated that after receiving the reply from Germany, he had contacted the accountant of the Czech tax authority and remained with her in such a way that, after checking the invoices, she wanted to talk with the company owner about issuing a supplementary VAT return for the third quarter of 2004.
So far, no additional VAT return has been issued.
The Czech financial official told the NK that he would proceed in such a way that the deadlines for a retroactive VAT setting for the tax period in question would be respected.
17.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German tax authorities delivered goods worth €11,600 to the German tax authorities.
In the context of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the German financial official asked for an examination of whether the aforementioned Czech tax authorities actually existed, as the alleged capital owner of the German tax authorities had set up a number of bogus funds in Germany.
In the course of the FA's review of the transaction, the Czech tax authorities confirmed the purchase of the goods.
According to the Czech tax authorities, however, the goods were not shipped from Germany to the Czech Republic, but were sold on in Germany in 2005.
The Czech tax expert presented evidence of the sale in January 2005.
The Czech tax collector was not registered in Germany as subject to VAT and had not taxed the sale of the goods in question either in the Czech Republic or in Germany.
All of these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany, and the Czech finance official provided this information in his response to the request for information to the German financial administration.
In a request to the local Czech financial officer, the NK found that the Czech tax collector had filed a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004 on the basis of a tax audit, in which, among other things, he declared the value of the goods he had purchased from a German tax collector and, at the same time, asserted the right of deduction for the purchase from other Member States.
In his Czech sales tax return, he did not register any sales tax on the sale of goods in Germany.
On the basis of a supplementary VAT return, which had been issued after the external audit, the Czech financial officer fixed the VAT liability unchanged.
According to Czech law, in this case, there was no purchase of goods from other Member States, as the goods were not shipped or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.
As a result, the Czech financial officer drew the wrong conclusion during the external audit.
The BRH found that immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information, which showed that the goods had not left Germany, the German financial official corrected the tax return of the German tax collector and demanded the payment of VAT worth €1,600.
In addition, the relevant FA sent a control notice to the FA responsible for the actual recipient of the goods, in order to ensure that the resale of these goods is properly taxed.
In the following cases, contractors declared intra-community deliveries that may not have been carried out:
18.
The Czech finance official received a request for information from the German tax administration on whether the Czech tax collector had purchased a car worth €47,400 from the German tax authority in February 2005.
The request for information was accompanied as an attachment by an imprint of the VAT registration certificate of the Czech tax authorities.
A photocopy of the passport was attached to the person who was supposed to have carried the vehicle.
In the course of his investigation, the Czech financial officer found that the passport had been stolen, that the person named in it had not imported a vehicle into the Czech Republic and stated that he had no contact with a German tax collector.
The VAT registration certificate, the imprint of which had been sent by the German side, had not been issued by the Czech financial administration.
With this information, the Czech financial officer responded to the request for information and, at the same time, stated that he could not confirm the purchase of the car.
In a request to the local Czech financial officer, the NK stated that the Czech tax collector does not have his seat at the address indicated in the Commercial Register and that the managing director of the company is not available.
Following a tax complaint procedure for the tax period of February 2005, the Czech financial officer set the tax liability of the Czech tax collector at zero.
As part of a further investigation, the Czech finance official found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had purchased it on the basis of an internet advertisement.
The BRH found that the local German financial official had rejected the German tax authority's claim to exempt this delivery from VAT on the basis of the Czech response to the request for information.
19. In the course of an external audit, a German FA was unable to clarify a difference of €3,000 between the value of the goods purchased in the VAT return and the reported values from other Member States.
A Czech tax collector should have delivered goods worth €89,424 to a German tax collector in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005.
Since the acquisition declared by the German tax authorities was not in line with the MIAS data, the German financial officer asked for verification of the deliveries and their payment as part of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In his response to the request for information, the Czech finance official said that the only managing director of the Czech company had been deleted from the commercial register on 8 July 2005 and that a new managing director had not yet been registered.
The German recipient of the goods was presumed to be a relative of the shareholder of the Czech company.
The Czech tax collector issued a VAT return and a ZM, which had been signed by a person not authorised to do so, namely the company's shareholder, following the deletion of the managing director in the Commercial Register.
The accountant of the Czech tax office informed the financial officer that the owner of the capital had deposited the payment received for the invoiced goods in euros into the company's account.
Cash receipts have not been issued.
In a request to the local Czech FA, the NK found that the financial officer had accepted the Czech tax authority's claim for VAT exemption for goods delivered to other Member States, worth CZK 1,326,307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 in the first quarter of 2005.
The BRH found that the German financial officer did not correct the German buyer's VAT return, as in the meantime a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German tax collector.
Since the previous external audit showed no evidence of tax fraud, there is no prospect of actually being able to collect a fixed VAT liability.
20. According to the MIAS data, a German tax collector purchased goods from the Czech Republic worth €4,251,196 in 2005, according to which he had purchased goods worth €43,274 in the previous year.
The German tax expert did not explain the intra-Community acquisitions either in his 2004 tax return or in the 2005 tax return.
In addition, he did not declare any corresponding initial sales in terms of value.
Due to these inconsistencies, the German FA submitted a request for information regarding the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006.
In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-community deliveries of goods totaling CZK 167,246,083.
On 6 September 2006, the request for information was received, in which the German side requested to check whether the delivery reported by the Czech tax authorities had actually taken place.
In response to this request for information, the Czech Finance Administration stated that the German request could not be complied with because the Czech company did not have a managing director (or other legal representative).
It can be seen from the documents provided to the NK by the competent financial officer that, together with the managing director of the Czech tax authority, a protocol was drawn up on 30 March 2006 on the commencement of the VAT audit for the fourth quarter of 2004 and the period from January to December 2005.
At the same time, the tax payer was asked by the financial officer to submit all accounting and tax documents for this period, but failed to do so.
According to the Commercial Register, the term of office of the sole managing director expired on 16 May 2005 without the appointment of a new managing director.
The Czech tax collector has not issued any tax returns since April 2006.
As part of the parallel investigation, the NK, in collaboration with the BRH, investigated several cases of intra-Community deliveries between the Czech Republic and Germany, which were not the subject of a prior exchange of information between the two countries.
The two audit bodies exchanged information on the cases examined through the CLO of both countries.
21. A Czech company (UCR), which is not based in Germany, informed the relevant FA (Chemnitz-Süd) that it wanted to do tax-sensitive business in Germany.
On the basis of this information, the company was registered as of June 2005, but did not receive a German UST-IdNr.
The (UCR) accepted an order from a Danish company (UDK) for the production of wind turbines and their delivery to Austria on behalf of, at the risk and for the account of the Danish customer.
Due to insufficient own production capacity, the Danish company passed on part of the contract to a German tax authority (Ude), which is based in Germany.
The following illustration depicts the contractual relations and the transport route of the wind turbines:
According to German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:
- The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines on its behalf, at its risk and for its own account to be installed in Austria.
Due to the installation, its delivery will take place in Austria, i.e. the delivery of the wind turbines will be controllable in Austria.
- Because the forwarder was commissioned by the Danish company (UDK) and the latter had the transport carried out in his own name, at his own risk and for his own account, the place of delivery of the German sub-contractor (Ude) is where the transport started, i.e. in Germany.
Although the wind turbines were delivered to another EC Member State (AU) and the recipient is registered as subject to tax in an EC Member State (CR), no tax exemption could be claimed for the delivery of the German sub-contractor (Ude), as the EC Member State for which the delivery was intended is different from the seat state of the Czech company 19.
Accordingly, the delivery is properly taxed in Germany, and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the deduction in its VAT returns.
The location of the delivery of the Czech company (UCR) also depends on the place where the transport started.
However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.
- The delivery of wind turbines manufactured in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
- The delivery of the remaining wind turbines, which were manufactured in Germany, took place in Germany.
Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) delivered both intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic to Austria as well as intra-Community deliveries from Germany to Austria.
The BRH found that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare in its German tax returns or in its domestic deliveries to the German CLO.
As a result, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-Community deliveries uniformly as intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic.
The NAC found that (UCR) did not report intra-Community deliveries to Austria, but intra-Community deliveries to Denmark.
In order to ensure the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria, it would be necessary to cooperate with at least four financial administrations (the Austrian, Czech, Danish and German), although in this case there are no signs of tax fraud or tax evasion.
In addition, the NAC and the BRH examined case designs in order to show the size of the differences caused by the different legislation in 2004 between the information in the VAT returns and the MIAS data.
The cases examined also show that it will take some time for the tax authorities and the FÄ to apply the new legislation:
22. In its zm for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004, a Czech tax collector reported deliveries of goods totaling CZK 792,977,452 to a German tax collector.
During the same period, another Czech tax collector reported a total value of CZK 18,157,265 in his intra-Community deliveries to another German tax collector.
From the information provided by the BRH to the NK, it emerged that in both cases it was a matter of electricity supplies.
Both Czech tax authorities took into account the above-mentioned deliveries in accordance with Czech Law No 235 / 2004, which was in force in 2004.
In a further examination of these transactions, an audit group of the NK found that in 2004 there were different legal regulations governing the supply or acquisition of electrical energy between the Czech Republic and Germany.
Whereas in the Czech Republic the tax authorities declared the deliveries of electrical energy to be intra-Community deliveries in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 235 / 2004 in force in 2004, according to the German legislation in force in 2004 it was not an intra-Community purchase of goods, but taxable and tax-sensitive sales in Germany.
The differences in the legal provisions were eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Law No 635 / 2004, which amended some tax provisions with effect from 1 January 2005.
23. In the examination of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions in cooperation with the BRH, it was further established that a Czech tax collector, in his ZM for the first and fourth quarter of 2005, made intra-Community deliveries to a German tax collector with a total value of CZK 240,411,163, and another Czech tax controller, in his ZM for the same period, declared intra-Community deliveries to another German tax collector at C3.76.
Information sent from the BRH to the NK showed that in both cases it was a matter of supplies of electrical energy.
In accordance with the wording of Law No 235 / 2004, which will apply from 1 January 2005, the place of performance for the supply of electrical energy is the place where the purchaser has his legal seat, place of business or place of business for which the delivery takes place.
For this reason, the Czech tax authorities should not have indicated the electricity deliveries in their zm for 2005.
The fact that both controllers treated the supply of electrical energy in their zm as intra-Community deliveries led to a pay difference of CZK 503,881,939 in MIAS.
Conclusion
Through the cooperation, the goals of the BRH and the NK have been achieved.
Both auditors gained in-depth knowledge of the systems of VAT management in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The cooperation revealed differences in the two systems and in the legal regulations that govern the VAT administration.
During the parallel examinations, interesting cases of intra-community deliveries or acquisitions were revealed.
For some of them, it is worth further observation.
On the basis of the audit results, both audit bodies drew up recommendations on the management of turnover tax.
The follow-up of these recommendations in the form of a review should be part of the follow-up.
The new experience and knowledge gained through the collaboration between the two audit bodies is the basis for the successful conduct of future audits in the area of VAT administration.

Laschet calls for the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU), in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has called for the rule of law in Turkey.
Relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed," Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This concerns above all the waves of arrests, the press and religious freedom.
He therefore "made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalise in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, then the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this."
Laschet also referred to the cases of Germans who are in jail in Turkey, according to his own statements.
He said he expected freedom of expression to be respected.
As a result, Erdogan once again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence's readiness to fly at Cologne Airport at short notice.
Originally, it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn - but the owners of the castle had rejected it out of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the conversation, Erdogan travelled on to the opening of the Ditib mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had canceled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said: "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."

While US President Trump is not tired of emphasizing the success of negotiations on North Korea's denuclearization, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri is calling for Washington to be accommodated.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, has accused the U.S. government at the U.N. General Debate of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula with its continued sanctions.
"The latest stalemate comes as the US is relying on coercive measures that are deadly to building confidence," Ri said in New York.
In these circumstances, disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances, there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," the North Korean chief diplomat said.
That punitive measures could "bring North Korea to its knees" is "a pipe dream of people who don't know us."
However, in order to build confidence, his country has halted its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri stressed.
However, there was no "corresponding reaction" from the US side, the minister criticised.

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is designed to facilitate organ donation and relieve the burden on relatives in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can only be removed with explicit consent, stresses Swisstransplant.
(DPA) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve the burden on relatives in stressful situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be retrieved by Swisstransplant in case of need.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can continue to be removed - as in Germany - only with explicit consent, stresses Swisstransplant.
It is believed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five per cent of cases will a card be found at a crucial moment in the case of potential donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the wish of the deceased.
"They then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very stressful," says Immer.
A similar registration system is already in place in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on the possible donation of organs on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman for the Federal Centre for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert, says.
"There is no register where people can register their wishes - for or against organ donation," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken out in favour of a new regulation on organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be considered an organ donor, unless he or she disagreed.

It requires a high level of organisational, technical and financial effort.
When building and developing a sustainable European transport infrastructure, difficult compromises often have to be made with European and national policy objectives, such as the preservation of the environment.
It is precisely because of the necessary environmental protection measures that the construction of the transport infrastructure is costly.
When planning and awarding the construction of transport routes, administrations can save significant financial resources through careful action and decision-making, and can use them for other useful purposes.
One of the tasks of state audit authorities is to identify defects that stand in the way of optimum efficiency, efficiency and effectiveness in spending on the construction of transport facilities.
The audit authorities should not only draw the attention of the administrations to the shortcomings identified, but also propose improvements to them for the benefit of the citizens and for the benefit of Europe.
Summary
In 2005 and 2006, the two Supreme Audit Institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic, the Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) and the Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad (NK), carried out parallel audits of the expenditure for the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway (motorway D 8 in the Czech Republic and motorway A 17 in the Federal Republic of Germany).
The two highways are connected by a border bridge jointly financed by both states.
The cooperation with the NK enabled the BRH to carry out an in-depth examination of the cost-effectiveness of the use of funds in the construction of the border bridge.
As part of the cooperation with the BRH, the NK received data from German bridges and tunnels for its own cost comparisons.
In 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany signed a contract for the construction of the border bridge.
According to the planning progress, the completion date was finally set at the end of 2006.
However, during the procurement process, the road and motorway directorate of the Czech Republic (RMD) made errors that delayed the procedure and shortened the available construction time.
The contract with the contractor was therefore concluded later than planned.
The contractor secured the accelerated construction of the bridge by the end of 2006.
For this, however, the RMD had to accept significant additional costs.
As part of the joint audit work, the prices of motorway bridges on the D 8 and the A 17 were compared. The benchmark for comparing the price of the bridges was the size of the bridge area.
A price analysis using statistical methods identified bridges at a high cost per square metre.
The analysis showed that the border bridge under the large bridges, with lengths of more than 100 metres, was the most expensive.
This was also due to the increase in prices as a result of the delays in awarding contracts.
The comparison of the prices of the tunnels showed that the prices of the tunnels in the course of the D 8 are considerably higher than the prices of comparable tunnels in Germany.
In future audits of the cost-effectiveness of spending on the transport infrastructure, both BRH and NK can rely on a collection of data on bridge and tunnel prices.
Both audit offices recommend that bridge constructions be standardized and that steel composite and special constructions be carried out only where tensioned concrete constructions are unsuitable.
The course of the examination was characterised by teamwork and an open approach.
During the parallel examination, the examiners from both sides exchanged their expertise and skills.
Introduction
The subject of this report is the parallel audit of expenditure on the construction of the motorway from Dresden to Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).
The focus of the audit was on the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of funds.
The parallel examinations were carried out by the BRH in Germany and the NIC in the Czech Republic.
In 2005 and 2006.
The NK examined the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of spending on the border section 0807 of the D 8 motorway, amounting to around CZK 20 billion gross (around €690 million).
Of this amount, €64 million will be made available from EU structural funds (ISPA).
The BRH had already examined the planning and construction of the A 17 motorway between 2003 and 2005, regardless of the parallel tests carried out with the NK.
Of the total budget for the construction of all three sections of the A 17, of around €670 million, €277 million will be co-financed by the European Fund (ERDF).
The Prague-Dresden motorway is part of the Pan-European Transport Corridor IV Dresden - Central and South-Eastern Europe - Istanbul.
The D8 runs from Prague via Usti nad Labem to the Czech / German border,
The A 17 from the border to Dresden.
At the time of the test, the borderline sections of the motorways were under construction.
Both sections were released to the public on 21 December 2006.
While the motorway is thus completed on the German side up to Dresden, the D 8 on the Czech side remains incomplete, as the section 0805 is still in the planning phase over a length of 16.4 km between Rehlovice and Lovosice.
This is where the crossing of a protected landscape area in the Bohemian Central Mountains is planned.
According to Czech forecasts from 2001, the volume of traffic in 2008 in the border section 0807 of the D 8 motorway will amount to 22,940 vehicles per day.
German forecasts estimate the volume of traffic on the A 17 at the Czech border in 2010 to be around 25,000 vehicles per day.
In 2000, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic concluded a contract for the merger of the German A 17 motorway and the Czech D 8 motorway at the common state border through the construction of a border bridge.
Since both states are involved in the construction of this bridge, this individual construction measure represented an important aspect of the parallel audits of both audit courts.
Co-operation between BRH and NKthe
From the middle of 2005, the two audit courts began to consider working together on the examination of the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway.
Both sides had important reasons for this co-operation:
1.
Germany is partly funding the construction of the border bridge.
The Czech Road Authority is responsible for planning and construction.
There was no possibility for the BRH to examine this construction project itself.
2.
The NK did not have any comparative data to assess whether the funds were used sparingly with regard to the total construction costs of the bridges and tunnels on the D 8.
3.
The NAC also had to examine the effectiveness of the expenditure, to examine the essential technical parameters of the bridges and tunnels, which should ensure the same quality of use on both sides of the border.
Following preparatory negotiations, the presidents of the two audit courts concluded an agreement on the coordination of the examinations of the Prague-Dresden motorway on 4 January 2006.
In the course of 2006, the auditors of both audit institutions met at about six to eight-week intervals.
In doing so, they dealt with current problems and tasks. They developed a uniform methodology for examining bridge and tunnel prices, exchanged test results for the construction of the border bridge, and produced joint reports.
The ongoing exchange of information was essential to the cooperation.
While the BRH was mainly concerned with comparing the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels as well as the procurement procedures, the NKthe mainly worked out the methodology for the analysis of bridge and tunnel prices.
In Germany and the Czech Republic, the legal basis for financial control differs, and thus also the way in which the two audit courts complete their audits.
For this reason, the two authorities each drew up separate national reports on their audit results.
This report takes into account the results of the two parallel tests.
The cooperation ends with the signing of a final communiqué in the first half of 2007.
Construction of the border bridge
In the 2000 Treaty, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed to complete the border bridge, if possible, in 2005.
She later postponed the date by mutual agreement until the end of 2006.
The RMD acted as the contractor for the construction project.
Germany is contributing 42.13% to the construction of the bridge.
At first, the RMD provided for a tensioned concrete construction for the border bridge.
In 1999, however, the RMD and its German partner agreed on the construction of a steel composite structure.
They justified this decision with the possible reduction in the number of pairs of pillars from seven to five, and the associated environmental benefits for the valley.
In addition, a comparative calculation of the RMD had identified the steel composite structure as the more cost-effective solution.
However, this was due to a calculation error.
The calculation was based on the length of the new steel composite structure of only 397 m,
In fact, however, it is 5% longer.
During the procurement process, the RMD made serious errors,
By insufficiently preparing the award documents and inaccurately describing both valuation criteria and sub-criteria.
These errors led to subjective and ambiguous assessments by the evaluation committee and the director general of the RMD.
An inferior bidder challenged the outcome of the award process.
The subsequent investigation by the Czech Antitrust Office delayed the signing of the construction contract for the border bridge.
As a result, the summer construction season following the tender test was lost in 2004, and the total construction time available was shortened.
The contractor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter period of time, leading to a significant price increase.
Among the measures offered were the double assembly of the superstructures, the change in the shape of the pillars and the construction of an assembly hall.
In addition, the contractor was unable to procure the originally planned type of steel.
The new type of steel - whose higher costs of around €4 million were borne by the client alone - made it possible to shorten the construction time for corrosion protection and thus the total construction time.
Compared to the offer price of around €18.3 million net, the acceleration measures and further additions will significantly increase the total construction costs of the border bridge.
The shortened construction period alone led to a price increase of around €5.9 million.
The cost is currently around €25.9 million net (as of October 2006).
Comparison of the prices of bridges and tunnels
Both courts examined the bridge prices on the D 8 and the A 17 in order to identify the bridges, which were characterised by particularly high prices, and to compare the bridge prices on the German and Czech sides.
The study was based on mathematical methods.
The tunnels on the D 8 were compared with similar tunnels on the German motorways A 71, A 38 and A 4, as there were no comparable tunnels on the A 17.
In the preparation of this part of the exam, it was important to define the exact definition of the price.
For the comparison of bridge prices, both courts agreed on detailed guidelines, for example: To use the current price paid for the bridge without VAT.
(VAT rates in the Czech Republic and Germany are different and may change), not to take into account the cost of special founding measures, to use the European Central Bank's rate of 30.12.2005 for currency conversion (CZK 29 = €1).
Bridges of different types (reinforced concrete, clamped concrete, steel composite and steel) and of different sizes are available on both the D 8 and the A 17.
In order to ensure the comparability of the tested bridges, the bridges were grouped according to their design.
Within these groups, the analyses also took into account the size of the bridge.
Concrete bridges were by far the most common on both sides of the border (20 bridges on the D 8 and 36 bridges on the A 17).
The study focused on this type of bridge, as the size of the sample allowed the use of mathematical statistical methods and improved the reliability of the results.
The study showed that the m ² price of the concrete bridges on the D 8 / A 17 depends on the size of the bridge (length, road surface): The larger the bridge, the lower the square metre price.
In the case of German bridges, the correlation between price and size is more pronounced than in the case of Czech bridges (see illustrations below).
Two bridges with a significantly higher price could be found on the A 17, and four on the D 8.
These bridges were determined partly by a method of detecting significant deviations within a sample and partly by regression analysis of the correlation between bridge price and size (based on the distance to the regression curve, atypically expensive bridges can be identified).
However, the atypically high price of these bridges should only serve as a clue as to which bridges should be concentrated.
In order to draw definitive conclusions, the causes of the respective high price have to be determined on a case-by-case basis.
For example, this could be due to uneconomic administrative actions, but also to the requirements for protecting the environment or other legitimate reasons.
Taking into account the greater average length of Czech concrete bridges compared to the German ones (see table 1), the proven negative correlation between the bridge price and the length led to the expectation that the Czech concrete bridges would be cheaper.
In addition, the lower labour costs in the Czech Republic vis-à-vis Germany spoke in favour of this.
However, the evaluation of the results showed that the price of concrete bridges on the D 8 is higher than on the A 17.
In joint meetings, two reasons for this were identified:
1.
In Germany, construction contracts for bridges are predominantly awarded separately.
This also allows small and medium-sized companies to take part in the award competition.
In the Czech Republic, many bridge constructions are being awarded as part of larger contracts for the construction of several kilometre-long sections of the motorway.
Orders of this magnitude cannot be mastered by medium-sized companies.
2.
In the Czech Republic, the diversity of bridge constructions is greater than in Germany.
In this context, the NK noted that the construction of bridges will be determined long before construction begins,
This was already the case when the RMD filed the application for a planning decision.
At this point in time, it is selecting a certain type of bridge from several alternatives, but profitability plays a minor role in this decision.
Only a thorough analysis of the construction sectors of both countries would have made it possible to reach a definitive conclusion regarding bridge prices in the Czech Republic and Germany. However, this would have exceeded the scope of this examination.
The border bridge is the most expensive steel composite bridge on the D 8 and A 17.
The prices for the tunnels on the D-8 are about twice as high as in Germany.
However, a comparison of the technical parameters between the tunnels on the D 8 and the tunnels in Germany did not make a significant difference.
The significant price differences may be the result of an underdeveloped competition for tunnelling in the Czech Republic.
However, the small number of tunnels did not allow for generalising conclusions.
Efficiency and efficacy of the Dresden - Prague motorway
The independent Czech Republic was founded in 1993.
In the same year, the government adopted the plan for the expansion of the motorway network.
The planned step-by-step expansion of the D-8 from Prague to the state border with Germany was planned.
The section 0805 should be built through the Bohemian central mountains in front of the section 0807, which is close to the border.
The Czech Republic is funding the D-8 as part of the programme.
In the programme number 327 220 "Construction of the highway D 8 Prague - Ústí nad Labem - Czech German state border" two objectives are defined:
1.
As a national goal: To improve the connection between Prague and Ústi nad Labem;
2.
As an international goal: The connection between Prague and Berlin as part of the Pan-European Transport Corridor IV BerlinIstanbul.
The plan was to complete the construction of the section leading through the Bohemian Central Mountains in June 2008 and the construction of the border section 0807 in June 2007.
It should be noted that the end of the construction work is not the same as when it was commissioned.
The NAC noted that the planning decision had already been adopted for the construction of the section leading through the Bohemian Central Mountains.
Environmental groups have appealed against the decision.
A final ruling has yet to be reached.
Compared to the schedule provided for in the programme documentation, therefore, a delay in the completion of section No. 0805 for several years could not be ruled out.
In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed a postponement of the completion date of the construction section No. 0805 to 2010.
As a result, the construction of the border section did not achieve the national goal of improving the connection between Prague and Usti nad Labem.
The RMD subjected the border section No. 0807 of the D 8 and section No.0805 through the Bohemian Central Mountains between 1999 and 2001 to a cost-effectiveness investigation.
As investment costs, it set aside around €639 million for both sections No 0805 and No 0807.
Table 2: Results of the profitability study (EIRR = internal interest rate base)
Variant Opening of all planned highways and highways, as well as both D 8sections in 2007.

Opening of all planned highways and highways, as well as both D 8sections in 2007.
Traffic in the northern part of the border section 25,000 vehicles per day in 2010.
The economic impact assessment from 2001 was based on the assumption that the section close to the border and the section leading through the Bohemian Central Mountains would be subject to traffic at the same time.
At the time of the examination, it was obvious that the section through the Bohemian mountains would not be opened at the original date.
This reduces the above-mentioned EIRR values.
As of 31 December 2005, the cost of both sections amounted to €897 million excluding VAT, which is 27.4% higher than the cost-effectiveness assessment in 2001.
In addition, there is a risk that section 0805 will have a different, more complex course of action, which would affect the cost-effectiveness of the project.
The economic assessment showed that the construction of both sections of the motorway with a daily traffic volume of at least 18,000 vehicles per day in 2010 was economically justified. The forecast for 2008 had predicted 22,940 vehicles per day.
However, a study on diverting routes as an alternative to the missing section of the Bohemian Central Mountains is based on a traffic volume of between 12,600 and 13,750 vehicles per day in 2007.
A higher volume of traffic on the routes to replace the missing section with the Bohemian Central Mountains is highly likely to result in congestion and thus increased external costs, which were not taken into account in the original economic impact assessment.
The mentioned reduction in revenue and increase in costs means that the already low EIRR for the construction of the cross-border section of the D 8 will not be achieved.
The construction of the borderline section of the D 8 is therefore uneconomical.
There have also been cost increases in the construction of the A 17, as in the construction of the two above-mentioned sections of the D 8.
As part of the overall economic assessment for the 1992 Federal Transport Plan, the Federal Ministry of Transport estimated investment costs of around €320 million.
As a result, it calculated a benefit / cost ratio of 4.6.
In the meantime, the costs have increased to around €670 million and the benefit / cost ratio has been reduced by more than half.
The BRH had examined the cost-effectiveness of the planning and construction of the A 17 motorway in the years 2003 to 2005, regardless of the parallel tests with the NK.
He noted that the authority responsible for the approval called for an unnecessary landscape tunnel for the third section of the A17.
In the course of the examination, the BRH was able to convince the Federal Ministry and the Road Construction Administration of the superfluity of the landscape tunnel.
As a result, €10 million in construction costs and €150,000 in annual operating costs could be avoided.
During the examination of the first section of the A 17, the BRH found that the construction work was not sufficiently prepared.
This is illustrated by the following example:
During the planning phase, the road management did not allow the state of the rock to be recorded on the surface of the Dölzschener wall, as it was difficult to access.
It wasn't until the tunnel propulsion reached the wall that she picked it up.
It turned out that the rock was more weathered than was assumed at the tender.

FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You've felt the fear
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first victory of the season against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first victory of the season.
However, against Mainz, the factor of time also played a role.
Gelsenkirchen - It is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
That was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in it.
And there were lots of corners and lots of balls in our penalty area, "said Schalke's sporting director 04 - and breathed in.
After all, the Königsblauen still managed to seal the narrow 1: 0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first victory of the season.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11 had given safety to the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco: "Overall, the first half was good, both in terms of play and in terms of pressing," Tedesco obviously played more and more of a role as the game progressed.
Schöpf not really a headball monster
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," Heidel said: "If the team was half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The guys were afraid to give it out of their hands and so they kept pulling out.
And defended against Mainz with a man and a mouse.
To save the first three meters of the season.
"We all have a huge stone from our hearts," said Schöpf, who did not play an insignificant part in this with his head ball hit: "I'm actually the worst head ball player in the team."
But at the end of the day, only victory matters.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, including, of course, at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start in the early stages and make a firework out of it," Schalke's head coach said.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can look forward to a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, quietly and bravely, so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes
Arguably the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: Königsblau failed to worry more about clearer conditions.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the bar 59 / 72, or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a trembling victory," Tedesco said: "You've already felt the fear a bit."
So I'm glad we won.
