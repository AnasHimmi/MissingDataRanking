DFB chief Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB president Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil's return to the national team.
"This is a question which, of course, depends on the fact that you get into a conversation, that you also talk to him about why he apparently felt one or the other as laid down in his statement," Grindel said in the football podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the "Bild-Zeitung."
Despite the now months-long debate over Özil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of 92-time national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed, up to a certain point, that this would be the case," Grindel said.
In July, the 29-year-old announced his resignation from the DFB team and justified it on the grounds that Grindel had not defended him against racist attacks during the World Cup.
The head of the DFB repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for talks with German coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build up any pressure, but he knows it from football so that when "you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it's a pity that this conversation hasn't happened so far."

Return from the Ethnological Museum to Native People in Alaska decided
The Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation (SPK) will return nine objects from the collection of the Ethnological Museum of the State Museums of Berlin to the Chugach Alaska Corporation.
The Board of Trustees today approved a proposal to this effect from the President.
The objects are burial objects of Native people from southwest Alaska.
They were among the objects brought to Berlin by Johan Adrian Jacobsen, who between 1882 and 1884 visited the North West coast of America and Alaska on behalf of the then Royal Museum of Ethnology (today's Ethnological Museum).
Hermann Parzinger, president of the SPK, said:
"The objects were taken from the graves of their deceased without the consent of the Native People, so they do not belong in our museums."
"We will now return you to the Chugach Alaska Corporation, with which we have been working on our collection since 2015."
In the future, the restituted objects will be presented in the Chugach community, including within the annual Chugach Spirit Camp, which serves the exchange of knowledge between the generations and the various tribes that now belong to the Chugach.
As part of Mr. Johnson's current visit to Berlin, a memorandum of understanding with the Ethnological Museum was also prepared.
The objects are grave goods from Chenega Island and the now unknown location of Sanradna in Kachemak Bay.
Among them are two broken masks and a child's cradle, as well as a wooden idol.
Masks were usually burned or placed in graves after use, which is why today there are not many masks of the Chugach.
The red color on them points to the burial context.
The wooden idol is believed to be a shamanic figure designed to protect people from danger and death.
In total, the Ethnological Museum owns just over 200 objects of the Chugach.
The Chugach region in south-west Alaska has been home to people who call themselves Sugpiaq or Alutiiq for several thousand years and were formerly known as Pacific Eskimos.
About 1,000 to 1,500 years ago, groups of Indians, now known as Dena'ina (formerly known as Tanaina), arrived in the region.
Today, the Alaskan Natives, who call themselves Chugach, live around the Prince William Sound and Cook Inlet.
They live in seven communities: Chenega, Eyak, Nanwalek, Port Graham, Seward, Tatilek and Valdez.
Regular contacts with Europe have existed since the time of Tsar Peter the Great.
In November 2015, a delegation from the Chugach Alaska Corporation visited the Ethnological Museum with the aim of initiating cooperation for future projects.
The background was, among other things, the interest in creating a virtual collection of all Chugach objects worldwide.
Subsequently, the Corporation asked the Ethnological Museum for assistance in repatriating any existing grave goods from the region.
The Chugach Alaska Corporation (www.chugach-ak.com) has been an advocacy group of the Native People of the Chugach region in Alaska since 1972.
It is committed, among other things, to the preservation of the cultural heritage of these groups.
The U.S. government supported the return request with a diplomatic note.
In line with its basic approach to dealing with its non-European collections and research into the provenances, the SPK carefully examined the context from which the grave goods, which are located in the Ethnological Museum, originate.
In the present case, all indications are that the objects come from a tomb looting and not an approved archaeological dig.
It is clear from the travel diaries of Adrian Jacobsen that the graves were opened only for the purpose of extracting their contents.

At the end of the 19th century, Johan Adrian Jacobsen travelled to the North West Coast and Alaska for the Berlin Museum of Ethnology.

Jacobsen brought around 3,000 objects from the north-west coast and around 4,000 objects from Alaska to Berlin.

Treysa has struggled with vandalism and treachery
The entrance to the 36-kilometre track in the Red Riding Hood in Treysa is difficult to find and is littered.
Prescriptions against rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are hardly emerging.
Shards, cigarette butts, rubbish and rubbish, demolished bins and now dismantled signposts - this is how the entrance to the cycle path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the flagship railway track in the Red Riding Hood region, a more than inauspicious sight.
The topic has been occupying members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt for some time, according to the cycling commissioner of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The issue has already been raised in the cycling advisory council.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to the regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also introduced the topic to the local advisory board.
It's not just the rubbish that drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting point at weekends to celebrate.
Not only is it often loud, but the racks are also destroyed: posts are torn from the ground, bins are demolished, signs are knocked over, seating is smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the proverbial drop in the ocean.
They are annoyed that the resting place on the cycle path in Treysa is the meeting place for sunrises.
"along the entire cycle path, the focus is clearly on the Haaße hill," confirms the cyclist, who is now also concerned about the new cycling site in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea, he said, is video surveillance on the hill: "Possibly, this sets the threshold much higher for attacking common property.
This would, however, require that a police patrol pass by in a timely manner.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wants the Haaße hill to develop.
It must be made more attractive.
You can be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle path so far.
The marketing of tourism can still be expanded.
Our bike path is of a very high quality compared to others in Germany," said the ADFC members.

Music contest at the Kulturbahnhof: the "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in cooperation.
"a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "music contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians."
A contest "with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family," as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family get-together over coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long Albanian living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben," three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Lummerland kindergarten and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, said district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We haven't seen that in other parts of the city.
What were the lyricists associated with?
In the villages, the Hiltruper Lake and the Marktallee were particularly frequently mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig chose the avenue as the "Kö von Hiltrup" in his beating song.
The cultural station was also honored.
Time and again, it was about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short remodeling breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about their work.
Humberg was told that he had actually studied chemistry, but was now also teaching guitar.
Franke knew from the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic, meanwhile, has placed a lot on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper Gastronomy.
However, there was something special for the jury's favourites - so that others could also hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record an entire CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup-Schlager, which particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very beautiful performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, the children performed again at the final - and sounded "right good" even without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller of the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß of the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Wirtschaftsverbund, as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive launched the event on the occasion of its 10th anniversary.

The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each side there is a screen, in it four cards with keywords, which - the old trick with the red slide - can only be deciphered once you have put them in.
This ensures that the other side will not be able to read anything by mistake.
On the cards, for example, you can read from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
2nd window.
3. Dice.
4th Feast."
These are the terms to be encrypted from now on.
For it is not the terms that are to be guessed here, but codes.
Alternately one player per team is the encrypter.
He gets a code card that maybe says "3.4.2."
In "Decrypto" it is not the terms behind the secret foil that are to be guessed, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "furniture," "feast" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not, if possible, win the game if he succeeds twice in cracking the code.
The encrypter thus notes and reads aloud: "throwing" for the cubes, "lose" as a contrast to Fest; here, of course, something like "party" would be possible and "Prague" because he paid attention at school and knows the collapse of the window there.
That's how it goes round by round, team by team.
You don't know the terms of the other side - but it can be better combined with any hint that the encrypter gives there.
The rewrites should be as mysterious as possible, but not too twisted, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rule book.
The players will probably have to study it quite long and in detail until they can finally play.
The online explanation video at decrypto.info makes it easier.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dream ship," Heide Keller became a star.
Now she talks openly about the fact that the series may have been complicit in her marriage loss to Hans von Borsody.
Her role of chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "dream ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she left for good.
The series, which made her a star, could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"that might also have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world with a suitcase alone, and many of my admired colleagues perceived me on an equal footing," says Keller in conversation with the "Bild am Sonntag."
At first, she was always "the wife of Hans von Borsody," but that changed with the "dream ship."
For now, the journalists were only calling at Heide Keller.
"Whether he liked it so much, I don't know."
She considers it possible that her husband at the time may well have been envious, but "like many men, Hans shunned conversations about problems and feelings."
Keller always tried to be "the only right thing for Hans von Borsody and he didn't want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I've changed my mind," she continues.
She always felt she was "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman who, in truth, I never was, even though I sometimes appeared cheeky and brave on stage.

"Now there has to be a damn victory," said Bieletzki, who was completely serving.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).

Football: Bezirksliga: researcher VfL Wolbeck's performance against SC Altenrheine is encouraging
There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch went to court with his own.
He gave himself a word, the coach of the football district league VfL Wolbeck, first withdrew (inwardly) to reflect on the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
All history.
In the meantime it is running again around the Brandhoveweg.
Taufresher evidence is Sunday's 1-1 draw against SC Altenrheine, in the past season only razor-sharp past the ascent.
Yes, I'm very happy with the performance.
'We've made the spaces tight and put pressure on the ball.
That could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and sought out each individual for the match, simply to say "thank you" for so much opposition to the ambitious guests.
The coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
After the injury to Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him Luca Rehberg came on - the 4-4-2 went almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, where Niklas Thewes was in the front line waiting for balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more game shares in the first period.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs before his exit (17th), substituted Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
It almost took revenge when the SCA hit the Wolbeck box dangerously twice in minute 41, in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his trade.
After the break, the VfL cheekily took full control.
Thewes from 18 yards narrowly failed.
Schroer, too, came too late after 58 minutes on a Thewes entry.
With the replacement of Miles Geske, Fetsch once again missed a fresh-cell cure on the left.
When Altenrheine's Chris Naberbäumer fell to Robin Westhue in the 70th minute, there was an indirect free-kick for the groundsmen 18 metres in front of the guest house.
The foul himself competed and demonstrated his dangerousness at standards.
Westhues" thing with the right slap struck down the bottom left from the shooter's point of view - 1-0 (71st).
20 minutes left, which should be damn long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather in the penalty area awkwardly in the 80th minute.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79th).
Wolbeck had to survive anguished minutes in the closing stages before Geske had the winner in the 87th minute from twelve metres.
Might have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

The tourist association in Abtswind opened its wine festival session with a torchlight procession.

The chairman of the tourist association, Wolfgang Starz, mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe, welcomed the guests in the already prolific marquee. "To do something like this for 60 years - this is an insanity for a small town with 800 inhabitants.

Manchester United lose again, for Mourinho we're uncomfortable
Manchester United are now also losing in the 7th round of the Premier League following their embarrassing defeat in the League Cup.
Against West Ham United, ManU is subject to 1:3. The manner of the defeat is likely to be still to be talked about.
The scene was emblematic in the 74th minute, in which the recovered Marko Arnautovic shot 3-1 for West Ham; just three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
Suspecting an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all Manchester's defensemen stopped, leaving Arnautovic all the time in the world to kick the ball past the helpless David de Gea.

So, after the Reds started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea could not be beaten for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp's team in the cup, and the league's draw saw the Blues beat Liverpool from the top of the table.
Like City, London's two city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) also celebrated 2-0 victories.

Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart awkwardly bumped into Alex Iwobi's own goal, just two minutes later Mesut Özil made the decision with his third goal of the season.
Arsenal moved past Watford thanks to their fifth successive win and are now just behind big rivals Tottenham in fifth place. A strong impression continues to be left by upstart Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.

1:4 vs. Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth bust of the season: "Beschissene Situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in succession, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around him and gave them courage.
A lot of positive things were not seen before in the 1:4 (0:2) final of the table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shrewd situation, but you have to get out of it as a team," said 96 football pundit Pirmin Schwegler, pushing back: "That's obviously disappointing, because you always take a lot."
The winless Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86th) finished, is at the bottom with two points and is a candidate for relegation in its current constitution.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt, on the other hand, celebrated their first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored goals in front of 46,300 spectators for the DFB Cup winner, who advanced to the midfield of the table with seven points after the successful dress rehearsal for the Europa League match against Lazio Rome.
Croatia's runner-up Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action by the Hessen on his starting debut and never got to grips with Hanover's defence.
The striker, long struggling after the World Cup, showed with his pace and assertiveness why he is so valuable to concussion.
In addition to Rebic, Brazilian Allan, on loan from Liverpool FC, was also in the starting line-up of Frankfurt for the first time, which began swinging.
A header deflected onto the goal net by Lucas Torró (17th) brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96 defence of Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the landlords was almost inevitable and fully deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a deflected corner, Haller extended by head in front of the goal, where Ndicka only needed to keep his foot down.
It was the first Bundesliga match for the French second-rower AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt followed suit before the break.
This time, Haller matched his Storm partner Rebic, who skillfully tanked and left 96 goalie Michael Esser with no chance.
At half-time, Hannover coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak showing of his 11 and brought two new offensive powers to Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony played a little more courageously forward, but ignominious ideas remained until shortly before the end, when at least the opening goal was achieved.
The state of Hesse was much more efficient.
After just under a hour, Rebic started a solo and then laid across on De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was only show-jumping for the Frankfurt against overwhelmed guests, Jovic also hit a minute before the end.
The summer itself was also unusually wet.

The Church of the Holy Cross is home to the shot Christ, who is from the 30-year-old war and on whom, according to legend, a Swedish soldier is said to have shot.

Inauguration: new dormitory in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The life support Donau-Iller opens a new residential home for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
The fact that "a very special house" is now being handed over to its destination in Münsterblickstrasse - everyone present agreed at the inauguration date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the dormitory of the Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
In his concept, architect Rudolf Bader took into account wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas.
The first plans began around eight years ago, when the former U.S. Army officer building was put to the test for residents with a mobile phone cap: "The house had come of age and was out of date in terms of equipment," Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators moved in to demolish the house.
The new building should be as friendly and bright as possible so that the residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Life support Donau-Iller opens new dormitory
The life support invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450,000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both in terms of time and money.
The managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between a barrier-free and fire-proof design was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many requirements, which allowed the residents to experience the freedom to move without the help of others.
The head of the social administration of the district of Swabia, Gertrud Kreutmayer, also expressed a similar view: "The house is oriented to the special needs of its residents, who need tools to be mobile."
In doing so, the homeliness and functionality were well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The property in this location is a real stroke of luck, because it is no longer available in today's situation."
In total, the new residential home in Münsterblickstrasse offers space on almost 1500 square metres for 30 people with disabilities, divided into three residential groups.
Life support managing director Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed on a collective basis.

Colour powder and eggs: riots in Barcelona ahead of Catalonia anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of Catalonia's controversial independence referendum.
But there are already riots before that.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on October 1, 2017, clashes between separatists and police broke out in central Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence activists with paint powder, among other things, in order to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3,000 officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units planned a rally to honour their colleagues who were deployed to polling stations last year in what was considered an illegal referendum.
In an attempt to prevent citizens from voting, there was also violence at the time.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central government security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
However, some of the approximately 6,000 separatists then tried by force to break the police chain and threw paint bags and eggs at the officers, among other things.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured, it said, citing authorities.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the wealthy region of Spain, the central government in Madrid placed Catalonia under compulsory administration in the autumn of 2017.
The then regional president, Carles Puigdemont, fled into exile in Belgium.

Football: Oberliga Westfalen: accumulated perplexity: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen split scoreless
Red and white Ahlen continues on the spot.
Even at FC Gütersloh, it was only enough for a 0-0 draw.
In front of 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion, they turned out to be the final and the third last as a congregation.
The first half was very manageable from the entertainment factor.
Those who wanted to get a beer or a bratwurst could do so unconcerned.
There was no risk of missing a scoring opportunity, because there were virtually none.
First shot after half a hour
Gütersloh's Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire match in the 28th minute.
The Ahleners had the best - and in principle only real - opportunity when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling into a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty spot.
The hosts were even more innocuous.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel took aim from 18 metres just above the casing and after a hour, the Güterslohers also made an offensive appearance for the first time.
After a ball-tampering by Matthaeus Wieckowicz, things went fixed.
Nick Flock (62nd) "crowned" the quick-witted counter over Sinan Aygün with a lazy shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
They also trailed with a Wieckowicz header (66th) after a corner ball from ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, first bringing Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It did - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative, the Ahleners did not succeed.
It wasn't until the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but even that didn't yield anything.
Angelo Daut then tried to highlight the positive: "I like the fact that we played to zero," but unfortunately the zero was also in front.
"This time we weren't as torrid as we were against Holzwickede, even though our opponent didn't want to play here," said RW Ahlen's interim coach.
Offensively, everything "ploughed up a bit" against a team "that just wanted to defend.
In any case, I didn't feel that we could get an opposition," said Daut.
To his chagrin, however, as a spectator, one did not feel as if his team could score a goal.
The idea was too feeble for that.

Smears with local political message: No successful advertising for skate park
In Lengerich, unknown people have promoted the construction of a skate park in a way that is hardly conducive to success.
There are similar smears in several places, says Jürgen Khne of the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, criminal charges have been filed with the police for damage to property.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" were emblazoned on signs at the Gempt-Halle and the Old Town Hall, among others.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that an appropriate lettering had already been discovered on the advertising sign at the stairway to the Gempt bistro after the professional election fair on 19 September.
Since the short message at the time appeared to have been left "only" with an edding, it could easily be removed.

He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign will have to be replaced.
A special feature of this case is the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skate park is built, its realization will also be made possible by sponsors.
Promises have already been made, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department of school, sport and culture, without naming names.

Public procurement of works and corruption prevention
Joint report of the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel audits
Introduction and Overview
The award of services by public authorities is of great importance both for the state and for the economy.
The task of the state is to use public funds as economically and sparingly as possible and to ensure fair and regulated competition.
In the European Union (EU), the award of services by public authorities is an important part of the creation of a single economic area.
In order to ensure that competition is largely unrestricted across borders, contracting authorities must comply with EU requirements when awarding contracts above certain value limits (threshold values).
To this end, the EU Member States have to transpose and apply the EU's public procurement law into national law.
This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.
Below the EU thresholds, it is up to individual countries to regulate the award of public contracts themselves.
The award of services is also an area at risk of corruption.
Because of the inherently high potential for damage, the contracting authorities must therefore implement appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and undue favouritism in the award of their contracts.
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed in January 2011 to carry out parallel audits for the EU-wide award of construction services as well as for the prevention of corruption.
The tests focused on the application of the EU public procurement law, which has been transposed into national regulations, as well as on the prevention of corruption in the award of construction works in civil engineering, road construction and transport infrastructure.
The awards below the EU thresholds have also been taken into account with regard to corruption prevention.
The audit results of both courts of auditors are summarised in this joint report.
The report is also aimed at international institutions, such as the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).
The evaluations of the Bundesrechnungshof on the listed topics are mainly based on cross-sectional tests, which it carried out in the years 2011/2012 with the building authorities, which are responsible for the road construction and the building of the federal government in Germany.
He examined, for example, the construction of motorways and large-scale construction projects.
In addition, the Federal Audit Office drew on results from previous investigations.
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic based its evaluations on audit findings from 2008 to 2011, which included construction work in road construction, railway track construction, hydraulic engineering, building construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.) as well as other construction areas in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the awarding of federal public contracts is carried out primarily by the building authorities of the federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the State Building Administration is centrally responsible for awarding contracts in the field of transport infrastructure.
In the construction sector, the awarding of contracts is carried out on a decentralised basis by those bodies that use state budget resources.
In both countries, freelancers are also employed for part of the procurement procedures.
When juxtaposing the evaluations, differences in the procurement law and the market structure for construction services of both countries must be taken into account.
Development of public procurement law in both countries
In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide procurement procedures is laid down in laws and regulations.
Procurement procedures, limited to the national sphere, are governed by budgetary law and the administrative provisions based on it.
In addition, for both EU-wide and national procurement, many complementary individual schemes are provided by internal administrative provisions,
Such as the so-called "procurement manuals" of the Federal Government, in which the legal requirements are supplemented or further formulated in compliance with the law on the award of contracts.
In the Czech Republic, the award procedure is governed exclusively by the Public Procurement Act and other statutory provisions, which apply both above and below the EU thresholds.
The public procurement law was substantially amended in 2012.
The new rules increased transparency in the use of public funds, allowed for greater competition and limited opportunities for corruption in the award procedure.
Principles of public procurement law in both countries
In both countries, the open procedure, the non-open procedure and the negotiated procedure are particularly applicable for EU-wide awards.
In Germany, the measures below the EU threshold are subject to national tenders (public tenders, restricted tenders, hands-free contracts) which, however, largely correspond to these EU-wide tenders.
Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of the priority of the open procedure (for contracts to be awarded throughout the EU) and the public tender (for national contracts).
In the open procedure and in the public tender, any interested company can make an offer.
Another essential feature of German public procurement law is the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises.
For this purpose, the division of an overall construction measure into experts and non-participants serves above all.
The individual award of these lots is intended to enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.
Both of the aforementioned features of German public procurement law are proven instruments for achieving economic results.
In Germany, there are more than 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees.
In the Czech Republic, EU-wide procurement procedures are also applicable to construction projects below the EU threshold.
One exception is the simplified procedure, which allows a less stringent procedure to be applied below the thresholds and under certain conditions.
Czech public procurement law, in line with EU law, provides for contracts to be concluded when competition is guaranteed and a favourable price is achieved.
Current legislation in the Czech Republic allows contracting authorities to choose between open and non-open procedures.
There are more than 85,000 construction companies in the Czech Republic, including about 1,900 companies with 20 or more employees.
Construction volume of public tenderers and shares of tenders in both countries
In Germany, the total construction volume in 2011 was 307 billion euros.
Of this, 45.5 billion euros were spent on public construction (15%), which, in addition to federal construction, includes in particular the construction measures of the federal states and municipalities.
The construction volume of the federal government in civil engineering and trunk road construction (excluding railway track construction and hydraulic engineering) amounted to 8.5 billion euros.
The volume of contracts for construction works in the construction and trunk road construction of the federal government was distributed among the types of contracts in 2011 as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public tenders, 12.7% non-open procedures and restricted tenders, and 6.6% negotiated procedures and hands-free contracts.
Of these, 33.2% were pan-European awards.
The volume of public works in the Czech Republic amounted to 4.7 billion euros in 2011, representing about 25% of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.
In 2009, the volume amounted to EUR 7.8 billion, corresponding to 37% of the total construction volume.
Breakdown by type of award for 2011:65.1% open procedures 14.3% non-public procedures 9.5% negotiated procedures 8.4% simplified procedures for contracts below the threshold of 2.7% other procedures
The data relate to all public contracts for supplies, services and construction services awarded in 2011 by public procurement bodies.
The above-mentioned data show that the parallel examinations of both countries are aimed at an important part of public procurement, which has a major financial impact on the prevention of corruption, which has to be taken into account in all contracts, and in the award of contracts, the open procedure and the public tender are of paramount importance.
Summary of the results of the parallel tests
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have conducted parallel audits in their countries on the EU-wide award of construction services and on the prevention of corruption.
In this context, the working groups of the two courts of auditors compared the corresponding legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany, as well as the results of their parallel audits, which they carried out in particular in the areas of building construction and road construction.
In doing so, they found, in essence:
The EU directives on the award of works by public authorities have been transposed into national law in both the Czech Republic and Germany (Nos. 1 and 3.1).
In addition to the EU requirements, corruption prevention is also served by the procurement regulations of both countries, which differ in their focus and detail (No. 3.2).
In both countries, an essential requirement of the procurement documents is that they must contain all the information necessary for the proper preparation of tenders.
The specifications must be neutral and must not be subject to anti-absorbing requirements.
In Germany, the procurement documents have largely complied with these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, it is still a problem to determine the subject of the contract sufficiently.
In Germany, construction works must be divided into lots, if possible, in order to promote competition.
According to the findings of the BRH, this requirement has been largely implemented in Germany.
In its audits, particularly in the field of road construction, NKÚ found that the award of large-scale services without lots or with only very large lots could affect competition and lead to a restriction to only a few large companies.
Narrowing the market potential can lead to significant cost increases and risk of price or other collusion.
According to the provisions of both countries, the contracting authorities may, under certain conditions, agree in principle with the companies already contracted additional or modified services which prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (No. 4.1).
The respective requirements for determining the type of award were mostly followed in both countries.
According to the rules of the Czech Republic, the contracting authorities are free to choose between open and non-open procedures.
In Germany, on the other hand, the legal and budgetary priority of the open procedure for EU-wide tenders or the public tender, which corresponds to the open procedure for national tenders, applies.
This will allow more companies to make offers.
This reduces the risk of corruption, makes it difficult to negotiate prices between bidders and leads to the most economic results.
In the case of construction projects whose estimated total contract values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited construction authorities generally awarded the construction services throughout Europe.
Accurately estimating the expected value of the contract is an essential basis for choosing the right type of award.
In Germany, cost data bases are used for the cost investigations of public buildings, in particular in the construction sector,
Which are based on the evaluations of completed construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the field of road construction, but it is not yet an effective tool (No. 4.2).
In the case of construction works to be awarded throughout Europe, preliminary information and announcements have to be published, which is intended to strengthen competition by allowing interested companies to prepare for the planned awards at an early stage.
As a rule, the approved building authorities complied with this requirement.
In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or lack of controls may have affected competition (No. 4.3).
The selection of candidates for participation in non-public procurement procedures is particularly susceptible to manipulation.
Under EU law, the number of invited candidates must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not discriminate and must be announced beforehand.
In addition to the requirements of the EU, the contracting authorities in both countries are to switch as frequently as possible among the companies to be invited when selecting candidates.
In order to counter the risk of manipulation, there are some very detailed requirements in Germany.
In some cases, the audited administrations did not take these requirements into account.
In the Czech Republic, the decisions on the selection of candidates were not always comprehensible (No. 4.4).
In both countries, it is in the interest of fair competition to ensure that companies interested in making a bid receive the same information during the bidding phase.
Contact between these companies and freelancers involved in the production of the service description is to be avoided as far as possible in order to avoid anti-competitive agreements.
The corresponding regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.
The approved building authorities in Germany, however, did not comply with these requirements in part (No. 4.5).
The opening of tenders in both countries must take into account, in particular, the principle of multi-eyes and the principle of transparency.
The provisions on labelling, documentation, custody and confidentiality of the offers are intended to limit the scope for manipulation and are particularly detailed in Germany.
The tests in both countries revealed only a few complaints (No. 4.6).
In both countries, the examination and evaluation of the offers are determined by guidelines for the organisation of the structure and the sequence of events.
The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been consistently observed by the audited contracting authorities.
For example, contracting authorities handed over bids for examination to third parties without first seeing through the bids and adequately documenting anomalies.
The offers were thus insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulation (No. 4.7).
At the conclusion of the EU-wide procurement procedures, the companies involved in the competition will be informed of the intended appointment prior to the award of the contract.
This possibility of legal protection also has a preventive function against corruptive behaviour.
The Czech Republic also provides for the possibility of judicial review for non-EU procurement procedures.
Only in a few cases did the contracting authorities fail to comply with the deadlines set for the award of the contract or deviate from the bidders" offer in terms of content (No. 4.8).
The documentation of the procurement procedures was not always complete or comprehensible in the case of the audited construction authorities in both countries.
In this respect, the EU-wide transparency requirement was not sufficiently implemented in the award notices of some procedures.
Some of the shortcomings identified also reduced the corruption-preventing function of the documentation.
The contracting authorities of both countries largely complied with their reporting and reporting obligations (No. 4.9).
Fundamentals of EU public procurement law and corruption prevention
EU public procurement law
In order to ensure unrestricted competition within the European Union with the free movement of services and goods, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, among other things, the procurement coordination and appeal directives, which had to be transposed into national law by the Member States.
The European Union's general principles of awarding contracts are, in particular, that of competition, equal treatment or non-discrimination, and that of transparency.
In order to achieve these objectives, the procurement coordination directive sets out specific rules for construction works to be awarded throughout the EU.
In order to do this, their estimated order totals must reach or exceed 5,000,000 euros at present.
The regulations concern in particular the content of the award documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, the observance of deadlines, including for the receipt of tenders, the documentation of the award procedure, the requirements that can be placed on the qualification of the applicants and the Remedies Directive forms the basis for the legal protection of the applicants and bidders.
In the event of possible infringements of public procurement law, the companies concerned may have the decisions of the contracting authorities reviewed in review procedures.
Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the European Union directives into national law.
Corruption prevention
The importance of corruption prevention
In both countries, there is no legal definition of corruption.
In general, corruption is the abuse of a position of trust for private gain,
Which is usually caused by the beneficiaries of these decisions.
Corruption can hinder competition and cause significant economic damage.
According to estimates, the global cost of corruption is 5% of global economic output.
For the European Union, the amount of these costs is estimated at 1%.
In the case of contracting authorities, restrictive agreements or unfair practices may call into question confidence in the integrity and functioning of the administration.
Preventing corruption is therefore one of the fundamental tasks of public authorities.
In doing so, they have to review the organisation of their administrative structures and procedures in areas that are particularly vulnerable to corruption, in order to make appropriate safeguards against corruption there.
Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly reduce the vulnerability of decision-making processes to corruptive abuse.
The award of public works is generally regarded as an area of work that is particularly vulnerable to corruption.
Anti-corruption measures
In Germany, corruption - in particular bribery and bribery, as well as the acceptance and approval of benefits - is prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
In order to prevent corruption, the Federal Government has issued a directive and recommendations on the prevention of corruption12 in the Federal Administration. In addition to risk analysis, the following principles must be observed in the award area: priority of public tenders and open procedures, multi-eye principle and transparency, basic separation of planning, award and accounting, precise and complete documentation of the procurement procedures.
In addition, further anti-corruption provisions have been incorporated into the procurement legislation.
In 2011, the competent Federal Ministry for Public Procurement in the area of federal highways introduced an electronically supported control system,
With the award data - such as estimated costs and contract amounts - as well as information on the freelancers involved, it is collected across the board and evaluated for anomalies.
In the Czech Republic, corruption is also prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
The legal requirements of transparency and equal treatment of bidders, as well as the prohibition of any discrimination, are the most important bases for preventing corruption.
For public procurement, the Czech government has defined anti-corruption measures in a strategy paper on the fight against corruption for the years 2011 to 2012 and updated them for the years 2013 to 2014.
Some of the measures recommended in it have already been incorporated into national public procurement law and related administrative provisions by 14.
The main provisions of the new legislation are: lowering the thresholds for smaller contracts, requiring the contracting authority to notify the tenders in advance, including naming the reasons for the tender, prohibiting the limitation of the number of tenderers in open procedures and thus eliminating the possibility of selecting tenders by means of lottery procedures, introducing the obligation to publish the contract documents and all the annexes, introducing the obligation to publish the actual price and the list of subcontractors.
Results of the examination of the various stages of the award procedure
Award documents
Procurement Documents The procurement documents must contain all the information that the bidders need in order to make an appropriate offer.
In particular, the award documents must allow for an accurate calculation.
Bidders must not be given risks that cannot be calculated for them.
The award documents consist in particular of the description of the service and the terms of the contract.
In addition, they contain the requirements for proof of the qualification (ownership) of the bidders as well as the criteria, which are decisive for the selection of the most economical offer.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
The requirements of EU law for the procurement documents are addressed in particular to the technical specifications.
These must be equally accessible to all bidders and should limit competition as little as possible.
The service description must, in principle, be product-neutral.
Therefore, information on products or manufacturers as part of the service description is only allowed under strict conditions.
The avoidance of anti-competitive provisions in the procurement documents is also a fundamental principle of corruption prevention.
In addition, unclear or inaccurate information in the award documents must be avoided, as it opens up scope for speculation in the creation of the tenders and for manipulation of their valuation.
Regulations of the German and Czech public procurement law
Identical or similar regulations In both countries, the EU legal requirements for the technical specifications have been transposed into national law.
In principle, the services are to be tendered in a product-neutral manner without factory specifications.
In the service descriptions, the individual services must, as a rule, be subdivided into performance units with respective quantities.
The prices are to be agreed on the basis of performance units (e.g., euros per m2 or per piece).
Only in exceptional cases can benefits be defined by functional targets.
In any case, the service descriptions must be complete and unambiguous.
They must contain precise quantities and must not include services that do not determine whether they are needed.
Compensation according to flat rates or according to time expenditure must be avoided as far as possible.
These provisions are intended to prevent speculation and manipulation based on indefinite requirements in the award documents.
The service descriptions must enable bidders to prepare their bids safely and without extensive preparatory work.
The call for tenders will not be made public until the tender documents have been completed.
Diverging rules
There is no obligation to tender for construction works in lots in the Czech Republic.
If it is possible according to the type of service to be carried out, the public contracting authorities can subdivide construction services into several lots.
In Germany, construction services are to be divided into lots, separately according to the quantity (individual) and/or type or subject (individual).
The aim is to enable small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in the competition, to expand the number of possible suppliers and to make it more difficult to agree prices.
This type of award is generally considered to be the most economical.
In the Czech Republic, evaluation criteria must be specified in the award documents, both in the EU-wide and in the national procedures.
The aim is for the applicants to be fully and conclusively aware of the criteria according to which their offers are to be evaluated.
In Germany, the indication of evaluation criteria in EU-wide announcements, but at the latest in the procurement documents, is only mandatory in EU-wide procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, the assessment criteria are only to be recorded in an administrative award notice.
Procurement documents, which are drawn up by commissioned freelancers, may not contain references to these offices or involved planners or surveyors in Germany with the building construction and some road construction administrations.
This is to prevent individual companies from gaining additional information or other undue competitive advantages without the client's knowledge of the contact with these freelancers.
This is also the reason why freelancers are not allowed to send out tender documents or to interpret planning documents for inspection.
Only the client is the contact person of the companies.
There is currently no regulation in the Czech Republic on this.
Additional or modified services, which prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (subsidies), almost always apply to large construction projects.
In both countries, the legal provisions allow, to a certain extent, the award of supplements to the company already contracted, without the need for a public procurement procedure.
According to the EU regulations and the German regulations, the remuneration of the supplementary performance may not exceed half of the main contract.
In addition, the additional services cannot be separated from the main contract without significant disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.
In the Czech Republic, a narrower limit of 20% applies to such an award without public notice.
However, this may increase the risk of delayed completion of the construction project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the construction work already under way.
If supplementary services are also transferred to the already contracted company, under the regulations in Germany, an arbitrary price increase for these services by the contractor is in principle not possible.
The determination of the remuneration for the additional services is based on the agreed prices and on the basis of the price determination of the already issued order.
In addition to supplementary services, there may also be a reduction in the scope of services.
In the Czech Republic, minimum quantities cannot be charged with additional supplementary performance.
Key findings of the audit
BHR
Technical specifications and product-neutral tender
In individual cases, the specifications contained references to national technical approvals or standards, which had already been replaced by Europe-wide standards.
Some performance descriptions also contained product-related specifications - for example, for graffiti protection, joint tapes or noise protection plates - without this being necessary.
In some cases, performance requirements were described so precisely that only one product was eligible.
List of services subdivided by sub-services
In none of the cases examined, the BRH has found violations of the requirement to tender services in principle in a list of services subdivided according to partial services.
Completeness of the service descriptions
In the vast majority of cases, the tender documents were completed before the tenders began.
In some cases, the tender documents had to be corrected during the tender phase, as some positions or deadlines had changed.
In some cases, the performance lists contained positions where it was not determined whether they were needed.
A list of services for demolition work even consisted of almost half of such requirements.
Loose and scoring criteria
In the case of many contracts, there was no prescribed justification for the fact that the services, which were mainly advertised according to experts, were not further divided into partial ones.
There were no objections to the indication of the criteria to be used in the evaluation of the offers.
References to freelancers
A small part of the performance descriptions contained references to the freelancers involved.
Their names were partly on the cover sheets or in attached plans or reports.
In one case, the contracting authority even explicitly asked the applicants to contact the architect "on questions of the tender."
In the construction sector in particular, the contracting authorities attributed the above-mentioned complaints mainly to the omissions of the freelancers responsible for drawing up the specifications of services.
The construction services pointed out the lack of capacity in order to be able to adequately control the performance descriptions.
NKÚ
Technical specifications and product-neutral tender In the public procurement for the construction of a residential building with 12 residential units, a supplier and a specific product brand were specified in the service description.
The contracting authority did not allow the use of comparable products without justifying this.
Suppliers and products were also specified in the tender for the construction of several university buildings.
Performance descriptions with performance units
In the case of construction projects in some industrial areas, the contracting authority did not clearly specify the scope and type of services required in the specifications.
As performance units, it merely indicated the converted space of the individual buildings in cubic metres.
Completeness of the service descriptions
During the construction of a motorway bypass, the service descriptions were changed four times during the period August to September 2009 as part of a non-open procedure,
As the range of services had increased considerably and the technical requirements had changed.
Tender documents for social buildings included inaccurate location information, inadequate structural preliminary examinations and incomplete design drawings, requiring additional services to be contracted.
When building a large library building, the performance description of the interior did not include product quality requirements.
As a result of this lack of specifications, some sub-contractors built up overpriced and unreasonably high-quality equipment.
Loose and eligibility criteria
In the Czech Republic, the division of works into partial lots or the award of partial contracts is not mandatory.
An examination of the three major sections of the construction of a motorway ring showed that if selected parts were allocated in a way, savings of up to 31.6 million euros would have been possible, with a total cost of 620.3 million euros.
For example, in the case of six different buildings, which were the subject of a single contract, 2.5 million euros (25%) could have been saved in the event of a voluntary award.
If the construction of 20 bridges were to be dismissed, savings of EUR 11.5 million (25%) would have been possible compared to a total award.
In the award of construction services in road construction, the central contracting authority submitted very extensive reference requirements as eligibility criteria.
In the construction of part of a motorway, the contracting authority required bidders, in an open procedure, to prove, among other things, at least three road construction projects carried out, each worth 28 million euros from the last five years.
In the Czech Republic, a maximum of nine suppliers met these requirements.
The public award of another part of a motorway included six separate construction projects, in which the contracting authority had set an annual construction volume of at least EUR 480 million over the last three years as a qualifying criterion for the companies.
Two-thirds of the funds raised for road construction projects in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. 2.5 billion euros out of a total of 3.7 billion euros) were contracted by a total of five companies that carried out the contracts alone or as a working group.
In 46 procurement procedures with an order volume of 528 million euros, only two or even only one bidder made an offer.
The NKÚ pointed out that a narrowing of the market potential could lead to significant cost increases.
Additional services
In the case of the construction of a motorway bypass, the contracting authority did not apply any of the legal procedures for the award of additional services in two cases, nor did it enter into any written contracts for the additional services.
Due to unclear quantity and quality requirements, the first case yielded up to 63.7 million euros (net) and in the second case up to 165.4 million euros (net), which increased the respective order volume by 21% and 91% respectively.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
For several higher education buildings, some benefits were not included in the award documents, although the need for them was already known when awarding the contract.
Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the limit of 20% of the original contract value set by national public procurement law, the contracting authority negotiated with the contracted companies without making a contract announcement.
In the case of the construction of a large court building, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional construction services in a negotiated procedure without a call for tender.
During the construction period, the contracting authority extended the scope of the works by 2 million euros.
The unit prices for the additional construction services awarded without competition were considerably higher than comparable services provided by the same company.
Other findings
On the basis of a sample test of construction projects, the NKÚ found that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway kilometre in the Czech Republic is up to 14.6 million euros.
In Deuschland, on the other hand, the average cost of a four-lane motorway kilometre is up to 10.4 million euros, according to an evaluation of long-term data from the Federal Ministry of Buildings.
This comparison suggests that motorway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.
Summary findings
The basic rules on procurement documents are broadly consistent in both countries and take into account EU requirements.
They serve both comprehensive and fair competition and the prevention of corruption.
For example, the requirement for a sufficient degree of certainty in the performance descriptions should enable bidders to calculate and draw up their bids in an appropriate manner,
Protect the client from additional services to be agreed at a later date and also limit the scope for speculation.
In Germany, the common basic requirements for the award documents are supplemented by regulations aimed at further reducing restrictions on competition and the possibility of manipulation.
In the Czech Republic, there are no requirements to this extent, but transparency is increased by publishing the evaluation criteria in the non-EU procurement procedures.
The requirements for the description of services have been largely met in both countries.
In some cases, however, it was necessary to object to deviations that may have led to restrictions on competition.
The requirement for the formation of lots in Germany promotes competition and leads to economic results.
In the Czech Republic, according to the audit findings of the NKÚ, the award of extensive services without lots or with only very large lots may result in restrictions of the field of suppliers to only a few large companies.
The extensive reference requirements for road construction in the Czech Republic have meant that public contracts are awarded only to a narrow circle of suppliers and that smaller and medium-sized enterprises are not allowed to compete.
Also, a limited number of competitors often lead to higher prices and increase the risk of price or other collusion.
When awarding and remunerating additional or modified services, the regulatory approaches differ in both countries.
According to the EU requirements and the German regulations, supplementary services with a value of up to half of the main contract can be awarded without a public procurement procedure under certain conditions.
In the Czech Republic, there is a narrower limit of 20%, up to which additional services can be awarded without notice to the original contractor in the negotiated procedure.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This limit is often exceeded,
As the scope of services for public contracts is often insufficiently defined.
If the excess is greater than 20%, the additional benefits must be advertised with public notice.
By splitting services into lots, restrictions on competition and the resulting adverse consequences can be avoided.
Defining the method of awarding and taking into account the EU threshold value
By determining the type of award, the client determines the extent of the number of companies participating in the competition.
It can leave the circle of potential applicants and bidders largely unfettered, for example, through the choice of an open procedure, or limit it by imposing non-public procurement procedures.
For construction projects where a threshold set by the EU is reached or exceeded, Europe-wide procurement procedures must be applied.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
In choosing the type of award, the contracting authority must take into account, in particular, the European rules on competition and transparency.
If the estimated total contract value of the construction work of a project is at or above the current EU threshold of 5,000,000 euros, the construction work is generally to be awarded Europe-wide according to open or non-open procedures.
In exceptional cases, negotiation procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.
In the case of construction projects that reach or exceed the EU threshold, the contracting authority may derogate to a limited extent from the principle of pan-European procurement and award works in national procurement contracts, provided that the estimated contract value of the respective lot is less than 1,000,000 euros and the sum of these lots does not exceed 20% of the estimated total contract value of all construction contracts.
A single construction project must not be divided into individual measures without a compelling reason, or deliberately valued at too low a cost, in order to remove the obligation to award construction services on an Europe-wide basis.
As restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of the type of award plays a major role in preventing corruption.
The detailed justification of the chosen type of award as well as the examination of the application of the EU procurement rules are important elements of the documentation of the award procedure.
Regulations of the German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed the EU rules on procurement procedures and the threshold into national law.
Diverging rules
The Czech Republic has also transferred the basic equality of open and non-open procedures contained in the EU directive to its construction contracts, which are not subject to EU requirements.
There is freedom of choice between the open and the non-open procedure, without having to justify or justify the decision. Other procedures, however, are only possible under certain conditions defined by law.
In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure or, in the case of national contracts, the public tender is in principle a priority. This is determined by budgetary and public procurement law as well as by the directives on the prevention of corruption.
Other types of award - as well as the non-open procedure or the restricted tender - are only possible in exceptional cases, which are finally regulated in the public procurement law.
The existence of an exceptional case must be justified and documented in a comprehensible manner.
The principle of the primacy of the open procedure or the public tender is intended to ensure that competition is as unrestricted as possible, to exclude the possibility of manipulation by fixing it on certain bidders and to make it more difficult for bidders to agree on prices.
The principle of public tendering is a central element of corruption prevention in Germany.
Accurately estimating the expected value of the contract is an essential basis for choosing the right type of award.
The construction services in Germany can use planning and cost databases of public administrations as well as other organisations to determine the likely costs in the area of public construction.
These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects. The databases contain, among other things, cost characteristics for building categories, use units, components or individual construction services.
On the basis of such cost parameters, the expected contract value of a planned project or construction work to be awarded can be determined.
Corresponding cost databases for road construction have only a few building authorities in Germany.
However, a nationwide introduction for all road construction authorities is planned.
Contracting authorities in the Czech Republic cannot rely on central databases or average price determinations of comparable construction measures to determine the likely cost of construction services.
In most cases, the cost assessments are based on estimates of the funding body or are based on the amount of funds made available to the construction department.
Measures to standardise cost-assessment procedures are still in the early stages.
Within the framework of the anti-corruption plan for 2011 - 2012, the relevant ministries were commissioned to create a database for standardised building materials and materials.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The purpose of this database is to collect information on material costs and construction and extension works, as well as other cost-related data, in order to enable cost investigations and provisions of unit prices.
In order to better control costs, the Czech Ministry of Transport has also published a collection of data for construction projects,
Which will serve as a benchmark when setting prices in the financing plan and is currently being updated.
Key findings of the audit BRH
Selection of the award procedure
The audited contracting authorities largely wrote out the construction works in open proceedings or in public tenders, thereby complying with the budgetary and public procurement regulations.
In 2011, 59.5% of the federal building services in the construction sector were advertised either publicly or in open proceedings.
In road construction, this figure was 94.8%.
In the selection of non-public tenders, there were sometimes no detailed reasons why the contracting authorities had to deviate from the principle of open procedure or public tender.
In a cross-sectional investigation, the BRH found, on the basis of more than 16,000 procurement procedures, that non-public tenders have significant competitive disadvantages compared to open procedures and public tenders, and increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.
In the construction sector, more than twice as many bids were submitted for public tenders as for restricted tenders and almost three times as many bids as for hands-free tenders.
The investigation also showed that bid prices for restricted tenders and open-handed tenders were on average 6% and 10% higher than for public tenders.
Parallel studies by the Federal Ministry of Building and a National Audit Office confirmed the differences in economic efficiency between public and non-public tenders.
As a result of its studies on economic efficiency, the Federal Ministry of Buildings even found twice as many differences between public and non-public procurement procedures.
Taking into account the EU threshold value
In the case of the construction projects for which they had calculated an expected total contract amount of more than 5,000,000 euros, the audited contracting authorities usually drew up procurement plans in which they determined the construction works to be awarded according to EU-wide as well as the construction works to be awarded according to national procurement procedures.
According to the procurement plans, this meant that a share of more than 80% of construction work was to be awarded across the EU.
It could not be established that the obligation to award EU-wide contracts was being circumvented by cost estimates that were too low.
However, it was partly due to incorrect calculations that the minimum percentage of EU-wide procurement procedures actually fell short.
During construction, some contracting authorities improperly changed the provisions of their procurement plans.
They did not justify these changes and did not demonstrate that the minimum percentage of EU-wide procurement procedures continued to be respected.
For most of the construction measures examined, the proportion of EU-wide contracts was generally lower according to the accounting results than provided for under the procurement plan.
In some cases, for construction projects above the EU threshold, the contracting authorities breached the requirement to tender all 1,000,000 euros and more large individual lots in EU-wide procedures,
And chose national procedures instead.
NKÚ
Choice of award method
In the case of several major construction projects, such as the construction of some sections of the motorway, construction projects in the context of a major sporting event and housing projects, the contracting authorities divided works into several sub-contracts, although these services were similar or comparable.
As a result of these distributions, the individual benefits were no longer above the threshold and were then awarded in simplified procedures or even in breach of legal requirements.
Calculation methods for the estimated order value
In road construction, the existing price databases for this area were an inadequate tool for determining the expected order values.
The data were based on just completed construction projects, but there was evidence of a lack of economic efficiency, unnecessary additional effort or excessive profits of the contractors.
For three sections of a motorway ring, actual prices were about 37% lower than expected order values determined with the help of the database.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Transport revised the databases in order to be able to take into account not only the supply prices of recent years, but also comparable market prices and price increase indices in the construction sector.
In the construction sector, the expected order values were based on the cost values estimated by the project architects or on the estimates of the investors.
The actual order values differed greatly from the estimates.
The estimated price for the conversion or expansion of a large library was twice as high as the contract value agreed later on, however, eight supplements in the course of construction led to an increase in costs of 2.1 million euros and 27%, respectively.
Similarly, the actual contract value for the construction of a library depot was 33% lower than the estimated price, with cost increases in the construction phase.
In other cases, supply prices exceeded estimates and increased during construction.
In the case of the construction of a large library, the estimated price was exceeded by 16 million euros, or 22%; in the case of the construction of a judicial building, the costs increased disproportionately by 139%, as the area of use had only increased by 12%.
Summary findings
Both countries have transposed the EU regulations for determining the type of award and taking into account the EU threshold value into national law, so the respective regulations are largely in line with each other.
However, the priority of the open procedure or public tender in Germany goes beyond the EU requirements and the regulations in force in the Czech Republic.
Compared to the non-public procurement procedures, more companies have the opportunity to compete in public or public tenders.
The public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of offers and to the most economical results.
The risk of corruption will be considerably improved by not limiting the field of candidates by the client's manipulation-prone stipulations and by making it more difficult for bidders to agree on prices.
The investigations have confirmed the advantage of the priority of the open procedure or the public tender in Germany.
Under Czech legislation, contracting authorities can award contracts through open or non-open procedures.
According to the latest changes in public procurement law, the number of bidders may no longer be limited in cases involving previous competition.
This means that the non-open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.
In Germany, the contracting authorities have largely complied with the requirements for the priority of the open procedure or the public tender. In the Czech Republic, some services have been improperly distributed in order to circumvent the requirements for the choice of the type of award.
When taking into account the EU threshold value, errors had to be found in Germany, which led to a fall in the minimum share of tendered services across the EU.
In the Czech Republic, there is still no satisfactory solution to accurately determine the expected costs of construction and construction projects.
The building authorities should, if necessary, ensure, through further checks, that the requirements for the choice of the type of contract and the scope of services to be tendered across the EU are complied with or that the conditions for appropriate cost investigations are created.
Pre-information and notice
In the case of construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe, the public builder must inform interested companies of the planned awards in advance of the tender.
Preliminary information and announcements form an important basis for Europe-wide competition.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
The preliminary information is intended to contain the essential information on the planned construction projects under public procurement law.
They are required for those construction projects where the estimated total contract value reaches or exceeds the EU threshold and where the client wants to shorten the offer periods of open or non-open procedures.
In announcements, the client must provide more detailed information on the planned construction contracts to be awarded throughout Europe.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In it, he has to make known, among other things, the scope of services, the process and execution dates, the special requirements as well as the evaluation criteria and their weighting.
When describing the subject of the order, the Europe-wide standardised vocabulary of the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV codes) must be used.
Preliminary information and notices will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the procurement profile of the client.
In order to prevent discrimination against foreign applicants, announcements at national level may not contain any additional information and may only be issued after the text of the notice has been sent to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union.
Incomplete or inaccurate information in the notice may affect competition and may even encourage manipulation.
Regulations of the German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed the EU's pre-information and notice requirements into national law.
Diverging rules
In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and announcements must also be published in the case of construction works that are not to be awarded Europe-wide.
Procurement procedures may start at the earliest one month after the dispatch of the preliminary information to the EU Official Journal (for EU-wide contracts) or to the national Official Journal (for all contracts).
Only in exceptional cases can the publication of a preliminary information be dispensed with.
In Germany, no prior information is required in the non-EU procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, notices for public tenders and participation competitions before restricted tenders must be published on the Federal Internet portal and, if necessary, also in newspapers or magazines.
In the case of restricted tenders without competition, announcements of services to be awarded starting from 25,000 euros are required (ex-ante transparency).
All the planned lots of the construction projects must be listed in the preliminary information.
In Germany, this is of particular importance because of the small part of the loose construction contracts.
In the Czech Republic, the impact of this scheme is limited, as much less construction work is divided into lots.
Key findings of the audit
BRH
Pre-information
The contracting authorities examined published preliminary information on all tested construction projects with construction works to be awarded throughout Europe.
However, in the case of some open procedures, they shortened the offer periods, although the 52-day period required between the sending of the preliminary information and the announcements had not yet expired.
Other shortened procedures were put out to tender only after the 12-month period of validity of the preliminary information had already expired and before it had been extended.
In the case of many published preliminary information, there was no indication of the planned distribution of construction work in lots.
Announcements
The notices of the audited bodies contained, in part, CPV codes that deviated from the information provided by the preliminary information or that did not accurately record the required services.
In individual cases, notices at national level were published earlier or contained more information, for example, on the deadlines for implementation, than the notices in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Ex-ante transparency
The contracting authorities of an audited construction administration had commissioned a service company to publish the national procurement procedures.
It published the notifications on its own paid-for procurement platform.
However, the contracting authorities did not check whether the company had forwarded the notifications to the Federal Government's free internet portal as required.
Samples showed that only a third of the audited administration's reports were published on this portal.
NKÚ
Announcements
In the case of the construction of a sewage treatment plant, the contracting authority did not specify in its notice the criteria on which it wanted to select the bidders.
The contracting authority could not prove how the bidders were selected.
The limit on the number of bidders was allowed under the law in force at the time.
In the case of the construction of a motorway ring, in the case of an open procedure, the contracting authority did not specify either in the notice or in the documentation of the award procedure, according to which it wanted to evaluate the qualification of the applicants and how many applicants it wanted to admit to the competition.
The awarding authority concluded in its assessment that all six applicants met the qualification requirements, but excluded the applicants with the worst evaluations from the further procedure.
The procedure of the awarding authority was not transparent because it did not disclose information on the qualification criteria and the evaluation procedure at any point in the procedure.
Publication of the announcements
In the renovation of former military premises, the contracting authority did not publish the tender.
Summary findings
The two-stage information system with pre-information and advertising is an important part of implementing the transparency requirement for pan-European procurement, strengthening competition and thus preventing corruption.
Both countries have implemented the EU rules and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures, including in the national procurement sector:
Selection of candidates for non-public contracts
Unlike the public procurement procedures, the non-public procurement procedures do not allow any company interested in the performance of the services to be awarded to participate in the competition.
In the case of non-public procurement procedures, the contracting authority has to make a selection in advance of which companies are to be invited to submit bids.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption The EU rules allow a limit on the number of candidates in EU-wide non-public procurement procedures.
However, in the case of open procedures, at least five companies are required to submit bids.
At least three companies must be invited to participate in negotiation procedures with the award notice.
In any case, the number of invited candidates must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be announced beforehand.
The selection of companies to be requested is a process within the award procedure, which is highly vulnerable to manipulation, for example, by allowing certain companies to be given preferential treatment on an one-sided basis.
In addition, limiting competition to a few companies also favours possible collusion by the applicants.
In both cases, the procurement result can be significantly affected at the expense of the client.
The contracting authorities must therefore take special precautions against possible manipulation, carry out adequate checks and, in particular, ensure the transparency and comprehensibility of this procedural step.
Regulations of the German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
The rules governing the selection of candidates are similar in both countries.
In addition to the EU requirements, the contracting authorities should change as frequently as possible among the companies to be requested when selecting candidates.
Nor should competition be limited to companies based in certain regions.
The contracting authorities have to justify the selection of candidates and document the process of the selection procedure in their award notes.
Diverging rules
In Germany, at least three suitable candidates are required to submit bids in the case of restricted tenders and, in principle, several in the case of open-handed tenders.
Under the new Czech rules, with the exception of two specific areas, it is not permitted to limit the number of bidders in the case of non-open procedures and negotiation procedures.
In Germany, the multi-eye principle must be observed when selecting companies.
For example, if an employee has proposed a number of companies for a non-public procurement procedure, the management level of the construction department or an agent from the contracting authority must, as a rule, amend this proposal by, for example, taking out a proposed company and/or adding a new company.
The aim is to prevent a single person from being able to conclusively determine the circle of companies to be involved in the competition.
Otherwise, in the case of manipulative intentions, this could allow for far-reaching collusion between the parties involved.
The list of companies to be requested must be treated confidentially, including with regard to freelancers, and must not be made accessible to the general public.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In the Czech Republic, there are no rules for drawing up and keeping lists of candidates secret.
According to the German regulations, freelancers are not allowed to determine the companies to be asked for, but can only submit proposals to the contracting authority.
There is a loophole in Czech legislation on this.
Key findings of the audit
BRH
Number of applicants
The requirement to require a minimum number of companies to submit bids for non-public contracts has been met, with a few exceptions.
An evaluation of the BRH of almost 7,000 non-European procurement contracts for construction services in the construction sector showed that the contracting authorities asked an average of 6.6 companies to submit bids for restricted federal tenders in Germany and an average of 4.4 companies for hands-free tenders.
Change of companies and regional restrictions
Especially in the case of trades with few suppliers, the contracting authorities did not always change the number of selected applicants.
They took into account, in particular, companies already known to them and, in their view, tried and tested.
The reason for this was that, in the case of non-public proceedings, they had to ensure the suitability of the companies invited to compete even before the invitation to tender.
The BRH did not find an undue restriction on regional bidders in the non-public procurement procedures, but it did find a higher proportion of regionally based companies than in public tenders.
The contracting authorities mainly attributed this to the fact that, on average, the scope of services for non-public procurement is much lower and therefore, for example, longer routes are more important than for public tenders.
Multi-eyes principle and proposals freelance tigers
Contrary to the rules, the contracting authorities mostly failed to have the proposed list of requesting companies amended by an independent person.
They justified this in particular by the lack of processing capacity, deadline pressure or insufficient knowledge of alternative suitable companies.
It was also often undocumented who proposed the companies invited to submit bids.
A number of samples showed that freelancers had drawn up the list of candidates and that these proposals had been accepted unchanged by the contracting authorities.
As a result, the contracting authorities did not protect themselves to the extent necessary from possible manipulation.
Confidential treatment of the lists of bidders
At a contracting authority, the lists of companies to be requested were recorded in a data processing system that could be viewed by all employees of that service.
In the case of manipulative intentions, the names of the intended or authorised companies could have been passed on without authorisation and could, for example, allow collusion between these companies.
Documentation
The documentation of the award procedures contained only in a few cases justifications for the selection of candidates.
NKÚ
Selection of candidates
In the construction of a motorway ring, bidders were not provided with information on the assessment criteria and the evaluation procedures.
In the case of open procedures for the development and modernisation of waterways and ports, the notices did not indicate how the selection of candidates should be carried out.
In one procedure, all eight participating applicants met the qualification requirements, which exceeded the maximum number of companies to be admitted.
The award committee then carried out a procedure to select the companies.
However, this approach, which was acceptable in principle at the time, should have been cited as one of the criteria in the notice.
Summary findings
Due to the high risk of manipulation in the selection of candidates in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special precautions to prevent undue restrictions on competition.
With the multi-eye principle, the secrecy of the lists of bidders and the sole authority of the contracting authorities to propose the companies to be invited, the German regulations restrict such possibilities of abuse.
In the case of Czech regulations, the newly introduced requirement of the largely unlimited number of bidders in the case of non-public procedures can counteract possible manipulative restrictions.
However, the audit findings have shown that some of these requirements have been insufficiently implemented and that the potential for manipulation for improperly restricting the field of participants has not been sufficiently reduced in these cases.
The contracting authorities should completely eliminate the shortcomings that have been highlighted.
Offer phase
With the announcement of the award or the request for a bid, the bidding phase begins, during which the companies can draw up bids on the basis of the tender documents sent to them.
Applicants can submit their bids until the deadline set by the awarding authority.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
There are no separate EU legal requirements for this phase of the award procedure.
The contracting authorities have to comply with the national regulations, which are intended to counteract the possibilities of manipulation that exist during the offer phase.
These are, above all, organisational requirements and controls.
Regulations of the German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
The procurement documents on the basis of which the companies are to draw up their bids are, in principle, only to be sent by the contracting authority.
Freelancers involved in the procurement process are not allowed to carry out this task.
The contracting authority must ensure that all applicants receive the same information during the tender phase.
In the event of ambiguities in the tender documents or other questions relating to the tender, only the contracting authority may provide information to the applicants.
Freelancers commissioned with the preparation of the award documents are not allowed to provide information.
During the entire offer period, it is necessary to avoid contact between the assigned freelancers as well as the applicants.
Freelancers must not be allowed to become a hub of the award procedure, through which contacts can be established with anti-competitive consequences.
Offers sent by post or directly must be submitted in a sealed envelope.
Electronically transmitted offers have a technical encryption.
Diverging rules
In Germany, the contracting authority can also commission external service companies to print and send the tender documents, whose employees are required to keep the tenders confidential and to fulfil the contractual obligations conscientiously.
The offers received must be marked with an entry stamp in Germany and sent directly, immediately and unopened to a staff member responsible for custody.
This employee may not be involved in the award.
The offers received must be kept under wraps until the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, the tenders received are marked with a file number.
The contracting authority records the offer data, including order numbers, as well as the creation and entry details in a protocol.
The custody of the offers is not specified in the Czech Republic.
Key findings of the audit
BRH
The examinations of the offer phase focused primarily on the procurement procedures of a building construction administration.
Dispatch of the award documents
The contracting authorities of the audited construction administration sent out the award documents themselves or had them printed and sent by an external service company.
Freelancers did not send out procurement documents.
Information to applicants
For the most part, the audited building management did not comply with the requirements for the separation of planning and awarding of contracts in the appointment of the contact persons for questions and information.
In the service descriptions, she did not indicate employees from the contracting authority, but from the project management as contact persons, contrary to the specifications.
Some award documents even included the names of freelancers who had drawn up the performance descriptions.
In the case of requests during the supply phase, not all applicants received the same information in individual cases.
Labelling of tenders
At the audited building management, all offers received were marked with entry stamps and entry notices.
In some hands-free contracts, however, the bids were received by freelancers, which contradicted the proposals to prevent corruption.
Preservation of the offers
Following their labelling, not all offers were immediately and immediately sent to the staff responsible for custody, who included the offers in a steel cabinet.
In the meantime, in a construction department, the offers were placed in an open section of the post office, to which each employee had access.
Another department had hung a letterbox in a hallway that was not constantly monitored, in which some of the offers thrown in there remained even overnight.
Since the slot of this letterbox was large and unsecured, not only staff but also visitors to the service would have had the opportunity to extract and, if necessary, manipulate offers received.
NKÚ
There were no complaints on the Czech side.
Summary findings
During the offer phase, contacts between interested companies and freelancers involved in the procurement process are to be prevented in both countries.
By providing all bidders with the same information, the principle of equal treatment will also be respected.
The rules on receipt, custody and confidentiality of the offers appear to be suitable for counteracting manipulation and corruption.
The corresponding requirements in Germany are somewhat broader than those in the Czech Republic.
The results of the investigation in Germany have revealed violations of the regulations in some areas.
These shortcomings could be eliminated with little effort.
Opening of tenders
Opening of tenders
During the opening date, the previously closed offers will be opened and their contents will be read out and thus made known.
From the opening date, bidders are bound by their bids until the deadline set by the awarding authority.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
There are no separate EU regulations for the opening of tenders.
However, the national regulations on the prevention of corruption contain extensive provisions for the protection of bids and competition for this highly sensitive phase of the award procedure.
The multi-eye principle as well as the transparency and comprehensibility of the offer opening are intended to prevent manipulations and changes in the submitted offers.
Regulations of the German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
The opening date is to be carried out by several persons to be appointed by the contracting authority.
The multi-eye principle is intended to prevent individuals from being able to manipulate the offers uncontrollably when opening up the offers.
In most procurement procedures, bidders can participate in the opening date.
Only offers which were submitted to the head of the negotiations when the first offer was opened are permitted for opening.
Late bids may in principle no longer be taken into account.
In order to ensure the transparency of the opening date, the actions taken and the results of the opening of the bid must be recorded in a protocol, including the names of the bidders and the bid prices.
The protocol must be read out and signed by the negotiators.
It can also be signed by the bidders present.
Diverging rules
In the Czech Republic, a committee is carrying out the opening of tenders.
Freelancers can also play a part in this.
The committee can also be tasked with further stages of the award procedure, such as valuing the bids.
In Germany, a negotiator and a secretary open the offer.
The head of the negotiations must be an official of the vacancy.
The head of the negotiations and, in the case of construction contracts, the secretary should not be involved in the processing of the procurement documents, as well as in the award and contract execution.
According to the German regulations, the minutes of the opening date include not only the offer prices, but also details of discounts and special features, such as damaged or delayed offers.
In the Czech Republic, in addition to the offer price, only the language of the offer and the signature authority of the applicant are recorded.
The German regulations stipulate that the open offers must be marked in all parts in such a way that subsequent changes and additions are prevented.
The offers are usually marked by perforations with the date of the opening date. They are to be kept secret after the opening date and may only be made available to the persons directly responsible for the processing.
Czech regulations do not exist.
In the case of an award procedure in the Czech Republic, if only an offer is received, it must not be opened and must be returned unvalued.
There is no such regulation in Germany. If there is only one offer, it must be opened and then evaluated.
Key findings of the audit
BRH
Multi-eye principle
The audited contracting authorities implemented the provisions of the MehrAugen principle at the opening dates.
They each held the opening dates with negotiators and letter-writers, who were not charged with any other award acts.
In the case of hands-free contracts, however, there have been isolated cases in which freelancers have opened tenders sent to them without the participation of the contracting authority.
Minutes
In the minutes of the opening dates, the opening of the offers was not always fully documented.
In some cases, for example, the late-filed offers were not registered, in some cases even signatures were missing.
Labelling of tenders
The awarding bodies examined during the cross-sectional examination marked the bids according to the specifications by a perforation with the date of the opening date.
In the case of long-standing audits of some grant recipients, inadequate markings had been found.
However, these contracting authorities changed their labelling practices following the complaint by the BRH.
NKÚ
Offer period
In the case of the award of road maintenance measures, an offer was received by the contracting authority only one month after the end of the offer period. However, the contracting authority accepted this offer.
Summary findings
The regulations of both countries regarding the opening of the bids are in agreement in relevant parts. They take into account both the principle of multi-eyes and the principle of transparency. Thus, the risks of corruption and manipulation can be significantly limited in the opening of the bids.
The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
In particular, the requirements for the exact documentation of the process as well as for the identification, safe custody and confidentiality of the offers significantly restrict the possibilities of manipulation, such as subsequent changes to the offers.
In addition, those responsible for opening the tenders are not allowed to carry out any other tasks in connection with the service to be awarded.
The few complaints in total demonstrate the high level of acceptance of the requirements for opening up the offer.
Examination and evaluation of the offers
Examination and evaluation of the offers The client has to examine and evaluate the offers available at the opening date.
He has to determine the offer for the award of the contract, which is best suited to the requirements according to the given award criteria.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
The EU's requirements provide for a multi-step process:
First of all, there is the suitability of the bidders.
Bidders must be economically and financially efficient and have the necessary professional and technical expertise.
In principle, companies that have been convicted of bribery or fraud, for example, must be excluded from participating in the award procedure.
The bids of the non-excluded bidders must be examined in arithmetical, technical and economic terms and assessed on the basis of the award criteria previously announced.
The client has to determine the most economically advantageous offer. Offers with unusually low prices have to be examined in particular by the client.
The examination and evaluation of the tenders is a particularly tamper-prone phase of the award procedure.
For example, bidders can be unfairly excluded or bids that do not meet the requirements can be left in competition.
By favouring or disadvantaging bidders, the result of the valuation can be impermissibly impaired and thus the establishment of the economically most advantageous tender can be prevented.
The contracting authority therefore has to take special precautions to ensure that the persons in charge of the examination and evaluation meet the requirements of integrity and expertise.
It must also ensure the transparency and comprehensibility of the procedure and the decisions taken.
Regulations of the German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
In line with EU requirements, bids in both countries must be examined and evaluated in a multi-stage process.
The requirements for the certificates of suitability of the companies to be submitted, as well as the award criteria to be taken into account in the evaluation and their weighting are laid down in the announcements or in the award documents and can no longer be changed during the procedure.
After the examination of the bidder's suitability, the eligibility criteria may no longer be used in the evaluation of the bids.
The rating has to be limited to the award criteria.
The submitted bids must first be formally examined as soon as possible in order to determine whether they are complete and whether they contain, for example, anomalies that could indicate possible intentions of manipulation.
If bidders are excluded from further examination and evaluation of their bids, they must be informed of this without delay.
If the valuation of the bids results in a price that appears to be unreasonably low, the bidder must be given the opportunity to comment before a possible exclusion of his bid.
The decisions taken during the examination and evaluation of the offers are to be documented in a comprehensible manner.
Diverging rules
In Germany, the offers to be kept secret may only be made available to persons directly responsible for the processing.
The review of the bids and the calculation of the bids may only be carried out by the contracting authority.
It only has to employ staff who are not involved in the award decision or the implementation of the measure.
The performance of further examination and evaluation tasks is not specified.
If freelancers are tasked with the examination and evaluation, they have to treat the offers confidentially.
They can only make proposals for the decisions to be taken by the contracting authorities.
In the Czech Republic, award committees are to be set up to examine and evaluate the tenders.
The committees draw up evaluation reports with proposals for awarding contracts.
At the end of the day, as in Germany, only the contracting authorities have to decide on the award of contracts.
If evidence or declarations required for the submission of bids in Germany are only incompletely submitted, the contracting authority must give the bidders the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.
Only if the documents are still not available after the deadline, the offer is excluded from the valuation.
In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the contracting authority whether it gives bidders the opportunity to complete missing evidence or explanations.
If a bidder fails to do so, he must be excluded.
In Germany, in addition to the total price, the unit prices (prices for partial services) of the offers are to be examined.
If, on the basis of the price structure of the offer, there are indications that prices for partial services are too low or too high, the bidder must be asked to remove these ambiguities.
If he fails to do so and the contracting authority can provide proof of a mixed calculation of the prices, this offer shall be excluded.
The aim is to prevent bidders from speculating on significant changes in the volume of partial services when calculating their bid, which can lead to significant increases in the cost of construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, the total price is assessed, but not the appropriateness of the prices for partial services.
A mixed calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.
Bids with unreasonably high or low prices may not be subject to a surcharge in Germany.
If one or more bids fall short of the relevant price determination of the client or the bid amounts of the other bidders by 10% or more, the bidders have to prove the correct calculation of their bids.
If they are unable to do so, the contracting authority may exclude the bids in question.
In the Czech Republic, the tender can be cancelled after the cost-effectiveness test, if only tenders with unfathomable low prices are available.
Contrary to German public procurement law, for this reason, the contract cannot be refused in the case of bids with prices substantially higher than the client's calculation.
If there are suspicions of anti-competitive behaviour in Germany, the contracting authority must immediately report to its specialist supervisory authority at the leading level.
It has to decide on the measures to be taken and whether to inform the anti-trust authority or the public prosecutor.
The leading level of specialist supervision, for example, must also agree to more than 50,000 euros for construction services, if a contract is to be awarded by hand, if a contract is not awarded to the offer with the lowest price, or if the tender is to be cancelled.
There are no such regulations in the Czech Republic.
Key findings of the audit
BRH
Suitability and evaluation criteria
The vast majority of the audited procurement procedures were in line with the requirements listed.
For some companies proposed by freelancers, the contracting authorities did not check the suitability of the companies themselves.
A grant recipient contracted companies without the required proof of suitability being available in full.
In some cases, it was not clear whether the awarding authority took into account all the award criteria announced in its selection decision or whether it had based its award decision solely on the "price" criterion.
Selection of the persons involved and confidentiality of the offers
Some contracting authorities used non-approved persons to examine the tenders.
For example, freelancers or employees involved in the planning or implementation of a construction project carried out tasks that were only performed by employees of the contracting authority.
The construction services justified this by insufficient staff capacity in the respective areas.
In some cases, the freelancers responsible for the examination of the offers also involved employees who were not obliged to keep the offers confidential and to fulfil the contractual obligations conscientiously.
For the construction services, it was mostly not possible to understand whether the offers for the freelancers were only accessible to the persons directly responsible for the processing.
Review and arithmetical examination of the offers
Some contracting authorities handed over the open tenders to freelancers for further examination, without having first carried out the prescribed review of the tenders and the computational examination itself and docu-mented their results.
In the case of manipulative intentions, third parties could have made changes to the bids without this being comprehensible to the contracting authorities.
In some cases, anomalies or a lack of price or product information were not or only insufficiently marked in the documents examined.
Performance audit
In a sample in a building management department, the cheapest offers in three-quarters of the audited procurement procedures were more than 10% different from the estimated costs previously determined.
One in 20 procurement procedures has been cancelled due to inappropriate bid prices.
Not all bid tests and reconnaissance talks with the bidders were traceable or sufficiently documented.
In many cases, more detailed information was lacking, such as the unit prices of the most important positions.
Often, the deviations were only justified on a flat-rate basis, e.g., by references to changed market prices or increased material costs.
Construction services said it was difficult to identify and prove mixed calculations.
In a call for tenders by an institution under public law, the offer price of the cheapest offer was 66% below the estimated value of these services previously determined.
Further calculations or investigations into the causes of this deviation were not documented.
In a briefing, the contracting authority did not find any evidence of price dumping by the company then commissioned.
This left it unclear whether the estimated value was inflated or the offer price was too low.
Later, the client assessed the contracted company as a "cheap company" that could not keep quality or deadlines.
In another call for tenders, a construction department awarded the contract to an offer whose price was 35% higher than the value of the cost calculation.
She did not rescind the call for tenders, citing the non-material justification that this company could be closed to a reasonable calculation.
Suspicion of irregularities
In the case of an audited construction administration, there were two cases of irregularities, both of which were reported to the specialist supervisor.
In one of the cases, the calculation of two bidders was identical in a tender, so that the contracting authority excluded both bids from the procedure.
In the application of the other regulations, the tests did not give rise to any significant objections.
NKÚ
Aptitude test
For many of the construction projects examined, including higher education, road construction and the extension of the railway network, the contracting authorities did not exclude bidders from the procedure, even though they did not meet the requirements specified in the tender documents or could not prove their suitability to the prescribed extent. On the other hand, in one case, a contracting authority could neither prove nor explain why it had excluded a bidder who had met the requirements.
Scoring
When awarding construction services for a water treatment plant, the contracting authority did not take into account the predetermined assessment criteria in the examination and evaluation of the tenders.
In the case of a construction project for the expansion of the railway network, the contracting authority determined the weighting of the evaluation criteria only at the beginning of the evaluation.
In the case of road maintenance measures, the predetermined criterion of "shortening the construction phase" was misjudged in a procedure.
As a result, the shortening offered was insufficiently taken into account by the second and third-place bidders.
Documentation of the selection of offers
In three procurement procedures in the context of housing subsidies, the contracting authority did not document the criteria it applied and the basis on which it had selected the successful bidder.
When building a motorway, the contracting authority selected the companies for smaller contracts up to 20,000 euros solely on the basis of telephone surveys at prices and delivery terms.
Examinations of this selection were not possible because the interviews were not documented.
Summary findings
The regulations for the examination and evaluation of the offers in both countries correspond to the requirements of the EU.
However, in the case of details of the procedure and the selection of the persons involved, the respective regulations differ from one another.
In Germany, the process is more regulated than in the Czech Republic by detailed requirements, in particular for the implementation of the multi-eye principle and for the protection of offers.
The same applies to the requirements on the basis of which the appropriateness of the offered prices has to be examined.
In both countries, in some of the procurement procedures examined, it had to be established that substantial procedural steps in the examination and evaluation of the tenders were not, or were insufficiently, documented.
Without comprehensibility and transparency of the examination and evaluation decisions, however, possible manipulative interventions are favoured.
A particularly serious defect was the handing over of all offers to third parties, without the contracting authority having previously sufficiently reviewed and documented the offers and thus protected them from possible manipulation in the further proceedings.
If public authorities allow tasks to be performed in the examination and evaluation of bids by third parties, sufficient precautions and an increased control effort are required in order to counter the increased risk of manipulation.
When assessing the appropriateness of prices, the audited services in Germany did not always make full use of the set of instruments and did not sufficiently examine the price structure of the offers.
In the Czech Republic, complaints were raised in particular with regard to the aptitude test and the application of the evaluation criteria.
Conclusion of the award procedure
After the examination and values of the tenders, the award procedure is completed by the award of the contract or by the cancellation of the procedure.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
In the case of EU-wide procurement procedures, all bidders must be informed in advance of the proposed award decision.
The companies have the possibility to examine the intended award for information by electronic means or by fax within 10 days or for other means of communication within 15 days and, if necessary, to initiate a review procedure.
A contract may not be concluded before the end of this information period.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
If a bidder submits a request for review within the information period, a contract can only be concluded after the final decision in the review procedure.
Companies can also have the award decision reviewed by an independent court as part of this review process.
The review procedure is intended to ensure the legal protection of companies and to encourage the contracting authority to observe public procurement law throughout the award procedure.
In order to do this, he has to document the procedure sufficiently.
Regulations of the German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
Both countries have implemented EU rules on information and review procedures.
In both countries, the contracting authority has to decide on the award of the contract.
However, it must not deviate arbitrarily from the result of proper examination and evaluation of the offers.
The client shall place the order within the announced contract period,
Also because the bidders are no longer bound to their bids after the deadline.
In the case of open and non-open procedures or public and restricted tenders, the client may in principle not deviate from the content of the offer when concluding the contract.
The unsuccessful bidders must be informed promptly of the award decision and of the reasons for not taking their bids into account.
Procurement procedures may only be cancelled under certain conditions, e.g., if bid prices are inflated or the bids do not meet the requirements of the tender.
Diverging rules
In the Czech Republic, the 10- or 15-day information and waiting period before the award of the contract also applies to construction works that are not to be awarded throughout Europe.
In Germany, these requirements apply only to the area of EU-wide procurement.
In the case of the other procedures in Germany, bidders can only be informed of the award decision after the award has been awarded.
In the Czech Republic, an award procedure has to be cancelled if only one bid has been received or only one bid has been evaluated.
In Germany, the contract must also be awarded in the case of only one valid offer, provided that it meets the conditions of the tender and is economical.
Key findings of the audit
BRH
In the case of the audited awards, there were only a few complaints at the conclusion of the award procedures.
In some cases, companies received letters of contract for EU-wide contracts before the end of the information period, which may result in the ineffectiveness of the contract.
In individual cases, letters of order also contained content that deviates from the content of the offer, such as changed dates, according to open procedures.
In several cases, the contracting authorities did not comply with the award deadlines.
In the case of an open procedure, a contracting authority therefore awarded the contract on the second most favourable offer, since a company with a 50% more favourable offer was no longer prepared to carry out the services at the price originally offered after the contract period had expired.
NKÚ
In the case of a construction project in the higher education sector, the contracting authority deviated from the bidder's offer in terms of content in the contract.
For some contracts, such as road maintenance works, the construction of a motorway and a bypass, the contracting authorities concluded the contracts after the legal deadline.
In the award of construction services for the rehabilitation of former military sites, the contracting authority only forwarded the notification of the award of the contract to all bidders after the expiry of the legal deadline.
Summary findings
Both countries have implemented the EU requirements for the conclusion of the award procedure.
The legal protection of under-applicants or bidders increases the toolbox of corruption prevention.
In Czech public procurement law, the scope of legal protection is also extended to contracts below EU thresholds.
In both countries, the deadlines for placing orders have been exceeded.
This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.
In the future, the building authorities should avoid the shortcomings identified when completing their procurement procedures.
Documentation, reporting and reporting obligations
The award procedures must be documented in a comprehensible manner during their individual stages with regard to the relevant findings and the justifications of the individual decisions.
In the case of EU-wide procedures, the contracts awarded must be made known.
The order data is also recorded in an EU statistics.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention The documentation of procurement procedures implements a fundamental requirement of the EU-wide transparency requirement.
Documentation that has been carefully and promptly drawn up will only make it possible to trace the award decisions.
It also serves, in particular, to provide effective legal protection for bidders when awarding contracts above the EU thresholds.
Proper documentation is also an essential part of preventing corruption, as the obligation to justify procurement decisions in detail significantly reduces the scope for manipulation.
The announcement of a contract awarded in an EU-wide procurement procedure must be submitted by the contracting authority to the Office for Official Publications of the EU within 48 days.
The Office will publish the notices in the Official Journal of the EU, thus also implementing the transparency requirement.
The contracting authorities also have to collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and report them to the EU Commission via the relevant national ministries.
On this basis, the EU Commission draws up an annual EU statistics, through which it can gain an overview of the development of the internal market in construction services.
Regulations of the German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed EU requirements on documentation and reporting requirements into national law.
The rules on documentation and reporting for EU statistics are largely the same in both countries.
Diverging rules
In the Czech Republic, the obligation to publish contracts awarded is not limited to EU-wide contracts, but also extends to other procurement procedures.
The notice period is reduced to 15 days.
In Germany, in addition to the EU-wide awards, there is a publishing obligation only for restricted tenders and for hands-free contracts with a value limit of 25,000 euros or 15,000 euros without sales tax (so-called ex-post transparency).
Below these limits, as well as in the case of public tenders, only the companies involved in the competitive process receive information on the award of contracts.
Key findings of the audit
BRH
Documentation
A large number of the audited procurement procedures were not fully documented.
The award notes did not contain all the necessary information, such as the justification of product specifications or references to national regulations.
In the case of a procurement procedure, the contracting authority did not justify why it awarded the contract to a company, even though its offer did not include mandatory evidence to be provided.
In a few cases, the documents of the contracting authorities did not contain all the evidence required for the documentation of the award procedure.
Contract award notices
In some EU-wide procurement procedures, the contracting authorities failed to publicise the award of the contracts.
In the case of further procurement procedures, there was no evidence that the contracting authorities had made the contracts awarded known.
Reporting and reporting obligations
The statistical tables inspected contained the required minimum information. They were drawn up and sent on time.
Ex-post transparency
In most cases, the audited construction authorities published the contract data of the completed procurement procedures.
However, a building management company did not publish this data due to a transmission error.
The building authorities only noticed this error after half a year,
So that the contract data of the procurement procedures completed by then have not been published.
NKÚ
Documentation
In the case of construction measures for the organisation of a major sporting event, the documentation of the award procedures showed considerable shortcomings, mainly due to inaccurate information, such as incorrect bid prices in the minutes of the rating commissions.
In addition, some minutes of the opening of bids were not signed.
Contract award notices
For several road construction projects, notices of contracts awarded were only published late or not at all.
Summary findings
The rules on documentation and reporting and reporting obligations are broadly consistent in both countries and implement EU requirements.
The transparency of procurement procedures, including the award of contracts, is thus guaranteed in principle.
The regulations to be applied in the Czech Republic for publication go a little further than the requirements in Germany.
The shortcomings identified in the documentation and in the notices substantially limited the preventive effect of these instruments in the respective procurement procedures.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The construction authorities should further improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and contracts and fully comply with their reporting and reporting obligations.
Summary evaluation and recommendations
The parallel audits of the NKÚ and the BRH have focused on two key areas, which in the Czech Republic and Germany are essential for the award of works by public authorities: the application of EU public procurement rules and the prevention of corruption.
The requirements of EU law allow for cross-border competition to create a single European market.
Anti-corruption measures are not only intended to prevent or at least reduce corruption, but also to prevent economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the state.
The audit findings of the two courts of auditors on the application of the procurement regulations in both countries, as well as the comparison of these regulations, indicate similarities and differences that may be helpful for both countries in the further development of their public procurement law and its application.
Application of EU public procurement rules
The EU's requirements for the award of construction services have been transposed into national law by both countries.
Thus, in the Czech Republic and Germany, there is an important common basis for the award of construction services and the consideration of the essential requirements of competition, the equal treatment of the companies involved and the transparency of the procurement procedures.
The building authorities of both countries have, in some cases, subjected these bids to a great deal of additional administrative requirements.
The Czech Republic has to a large extent also transferred the requirements for the construction works to be awarded throughout the EU to its nationally adjustable procurement procedures below the EU threshold.
However, the investigations carried out by the courts of auditors have shown that the construction authorities have not fully complied with the requirements of EU law in all areas.
The building authorities in Germany should further improve the quality of their procurement procedures in order to be able to eliminate the objections raised when implementing the EU requirements.
The tests in the Czech Republic have shown, above all, risks that affect the profitability of the awards.
Incomplete descriptions of services required additional services, which were often awarded in breach of legislation, and cost assessments were often inadequate, and excessive skill requirements also reduced the number of potential bidders and restricted competition, especially in transport buildings.
Corruption prevention
The investigations have not been aimed at uncovering cases of corruption,
It is also because the courts of auditors do not have the necessary instruments to do this.
The courts of auditors can, however, examine the extent to which the administrations of both countries have taken precautions against corruption and manipulation in the award of construction services and how these requirements are applied.
When it comes to preventing corruption, the two countries have set different priorities.
The German regulations provide, above all, for a largely unrestricted competition, as well as transparency and controls, as central elements of the prevention of corruption.
The Czech regulations are primarily aimed at increasing the transparency of procedures.
BRH
In Germany, general principles of corruption prevention apply, which the entire federal administration has to apply.
These principles are also implemented in the specifications for the award of construction services and are geared to their specific requirements.
In some cases, the relevant regulations set out very precisely how the bids to prevent corruption should be taken into account in the course of the procurement procedures and in the selection of the persons involved.
In the view of the BRH, in particular, the primacy of the principle of open procedure or public tender is a suitable instrument for substantially reducing the risk of corruption in the award of works. Restrictions on competition, on the other hand, increase the risk of manipulative interference.
Risk analyses and adequate controls (especially the multi-eye principle), the requirements for transparency and documentation of procurement procedures, as well as various organisational measures, are also effective measures to prevent corruption and manipulation.
The BRH therefore sees no need for any fundamental change to the corresponding requirements of the administration in the award of construction services.
The rules on corruption prevention are largely taken into account in practice.
The shortcomings identified in some areas have revealed shortcomings in the implementation of some of the benchmarks.
The building authorities should further train their employees on the requirements for the prevention of corruption and make them even more aware of this problem.
A significant part of the complaints related to tasks that the building authorities had delegated to freelancers.
However, without controls and adequate safeguards, the risk of abuse increases when delegating tasks.
Therefore, manipulation and corruption-prone tasks should only be transferred to third parties if the administration can guarantee a sufficient level of protection against undue interference.
NKÚ
The Czech Republic has adopted an anti-corruption strategy at government level, in which public procurement is the most important element.
The Law on Public Procurement and its implementing provisions have been substantially amended.
The tests of the NKÚ took place during the implementation of this strategy.
The strategy adopted and the new legal provisions should be effective improvement measures, since the contracting authorities must justify the cost-effectiveness of the contract awards, the calculation of the expected prices, the adequacy of the qualification requirements, the essential evaluation criteria and the nature of the evaluations, and must properly document and publish all these aspects.
Recommendations
The NKÚ and the BRH are generally positive about the implementation of the EU requirements.
Widespread acceptance in practice has confirmed that the EU's bids for competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for the award of construction services within the European Union.
The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as a basis for similar projects to enable and promote cross-border competition.
In view of the enormous material and ideological potential for damage caused by manipulation and corruption in the award of construction services, both courts of auditors see the building authorities in their countries as being required to continue and, if necessary, improve their measures against corruption and manipulation.
In particular, the organisation and procedures of procurement procedures should be continuously examined for weaknesses and risks in order to be able to identify the need for action and to initiate appropriate countermeasures.
The comparison of procurement practices in both countries suggests that the share of open procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased, as open procedures offer a wider scope for competition and can significantly reduce the risk of corruption.
A greater division of construction services into lots can also have a positive effect on bid prices, provided that it achieves greater competition with a higher number of bidders.
Ensuring the correct implementation of procurement procedures is an essential basis for the efficient awarding of contracts by public authorities.
In Germany, the procurement procedures are carried out by the specialised construction authorities. In the Czech Republic, however, these tasks - with the exception of transport construction projects - are carried out by the departments themselves or by contractors commissioned by them.
The courts of auditors of both countries have the intention, even after the completion of their joint project, to develop the relevant findings for them and, if necessary, to bring them to the parliament and government of their country.
Both courts of auditors are also convinced that the principles of public procurement law set out in this report and its implementation are also of interest at international level to the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), because the principles and findings set out are of general importance in order to effectively combat corruption and to ensure the economic award of construction services in a well-functioning and fair competition.

Football: Juve coach praises after top-flight: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker had "played the best match this evening along with the half hour of Valencia," praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the record-breaking 3-1 (1-1) victory against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensively bought star was the decisive man in the important match against the chaser, even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is doing well," said Allegri.
Even though we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from the moment we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goal submissions, Juve turned the game around after the early behind by scoring Dries Mertens (10th minute) and hanging off the worst chaser for the time being.
The goal-scorer brought in by Real Madrid initially put on former Bundesliga prop Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double (26/49th).
And after a corner with a header, Ronaldo also did the groundwork for the strike of defenseman Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who only had to push in just before the goal line.
"he gives a lot of templates," praised the trainer.
But Allegri, of course, also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record goalscorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We have to get even better at serving him," demanded the coach.
Best Juve goal scorer is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three in his account.

Evangelical Academy Tutzing: celebrity guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy of Tutzing is offering around 80 meetings by the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has indicated that he will personally pick up the price of tolerance in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
For example, Academy Director Udo Hahn credited him with proudly saying, "All Federal Presidents and Federal Chancellors have already been with us." However, the fact that celebrities keep appearing at the Academy in Tutzing Castle was also a topic in the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, singer-songwriter Konstantin Wecker will take part in a conference on spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective, and on 29 September, the writer Frido Mann will attend a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France's president, Emmanuel Macron, has also pledged to receive the Academy's "Tolerance Prize" in person in Tutzing, which in another category also receives TV presenter Dunja Hayali (we reported).

Music cabaret: gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christ Church in Wolbeck.

The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: what would have come out of composing Mozart if "das Nannerl" had opened the door unexpectedly?

There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.

Administration of VAT in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Control audit report
Foreword
Taxes are the main source of revenue for public budgets.
A focus of the Courts of Auditors" activities should therefore be on the examination of this area.
This applies in particular to VAT fraud.
This alone causes annual tax losses in the European Union of an estimated 100 billion euros1.
Already at the VI EUROSAI Congress 2005 in Bonn, the participants pointed out the need for enhanced cooperation.
This makes it possible for the courts of auditors, for example, to exchange audit approaches and to optimise audit practice.
The value-added tax (VAT) is particularly suitable for cooperation, as it is harmonised within the European Union.
In 2006, for the first time, the courts of auditors of both states examined in parallel in the area of VAT.
The corresponding audit report was published in 2008.
Since the USt fraud is a widespread phenomenon in the European Union, close cooperation between the courts of auditors is needed, so that a comprehensive assessment can be made of whether the measures taken are suitable for effectively dealing with the USt fraud.
The two courts of auditors decided to continue their cooperation and carried out a second parallel audit. Administration of sales tax in the Czech Republic and in the Federal Republic of Germany
1. Introduction
Exam number: (CZ) 09/11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892
Subject of the audit: (CZ) Administration of the USt (D) Bilateral audit with the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic (hereinafter NKÚ), Control audit
The objective of the audit is:
 (CZ) The USt administration and the treatment of selected transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as CZ) and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter referred to as Germany) should be examined, as well as the procedures applied by the financial authorities in the area of intergovernmental assistance.
 (d) The audit should evaluate how the financial management has implemented the recommendations made by the courts of auditors.
In addition, other test fields linked to the USt should be processed.
The findings should be compared in order to determine whether tax procedures can be optimised.
The audit period was the years 2006 to 2008, including relevant information from the period before the audit period until the conclusion of the audit.
2. Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel examination
The audit offices of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have agreed on a control audit for the administration of the USt.
During the previous parallel examination, they had uncovered suspected cases of intra-Community transactions,
Which made a re-examination fit for purpose.
On the basis of the audit findings, the two courts of auditors issued recommendations on the management of the USt.
The aim of the inspection was to evaluate how these recommendations were implemented and to investigate the suspected cases.
The audit also looked at other issues, including selected cases of high-risk intra-Community transactions, mutual assistance in the recovery of USt claims and the USt audit of large companies.
The Courts of Auditors found that:
1. Recommendations made on the basis of the previous examination
• Recommendation 1: The rules for the registration of taxable persons should be harmonised within the EU
In the first audit, the courts of auditors compared the registration procedures for the USt in the two states and found differences that caused problems.
The Courts of Auditors therefore recommended harmonising the registration of taxpayers within the EU.
This has also been taken up at EU level.
The draft amendment to Council Regulation No 1798/2003 provides for the extension of existing databases in the EU, including a database with the identification number of USt criminals.
The draft also provided for common rules for the registration of taxable persons and their possible deletion.
The Courts of Auditors expected the Member States to agree, in accordance with their decision in principle, on appropriate rules to remove unreliable entrepreneurs from the USt system as early as possible.
On the final version of the draft, the Member States reached political agreement in ECOFIN.
The above-mentioned common rules are no longer included, and the two courts of auditors regret this.
They still consider such regulations to be important in order to prevent VAT fraud.
• Recommendation 2: Monthly submission of the summary notifications As a result of the first audit, the courts of auditors recommended to the Member States that the summary notifications (ZMs) should be submitted on a monthly basis in the future.
The amounts of intra-Community transactions could then be examined more closely.
Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax (VAT) for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions has reduced the deadline for the levying of VAT to one month.
In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by an amendment to the USt Act, which came into force on 1 January 2010.
In Germany, the implementation did not enter into force until July 1, 2010. Thus, it did not transpose into national law the obligation to supply the ZM on a monthly basis.
• Recommendation 3: Data matching of the USt pre-registrations and the ZM in Germany for more reliable VIES data and proposal to examine the merging of the procedures for USt pre-registrations and ZM. The German financial management has taken up the recommendation made by the Federal Audit Office and set up a working group to work out possible solutions.
The work has not yet been completed.
The Federal Audit Office will monitor further developments.
• Recommendation 4: Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level In the course of the first audit, the two courts of auditors agreed that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by one Member State alone.
Successful criteria and elements or approaches of a risk management system must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State.
If this does not happen, fraudsters will focus on the Member State with the weakest risk management system.
The Courts of Auditors found that the two Member States apply different risk management systems, which have both strengths and weaknesses.
NKU examined the system of information exchange within the EU - EUROCANET, while the Bundesrechnungshof concentrated on the German participation in the "Platform for Risk Management."
2. Verification of selected intra-Community transactions
During the initial audit, the courts of auditors jointly examined transactions in which it was doubtful whether they had actually been executed or whether they had been explained differently by the taxable persons of the two states in the USt pre-notifications (or USt declarations) or ZM.
The courts of auditors selected nine cases of intra-Community supplies of goods between the CZ and Germany for the inspection.
The examinations by the tax offices of both states had not yet been completed at the conclusion of the first parallel examination.
The audit revealed that the tax procedures for these selected transactions have now been completed, and the respective financial authorities had taken appropriate measures to do so (e.g., subsequent USt determinations or the prevention of pre-tax refunds).
3. Examination of selected, particularly risky intra-Community transactions
The audit also included highly risky intra-EU transactions between taxpayers in the EU covered by the EUROCANET system.
EUROCANET is used to identify high-risk taxpayers.
Member States can participate in this system on a voluntary basis.
The CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET. Germany has a passive status, i.e. it does not participate in the exchange of data within the framework of EUROCANET.
From the point of view of an active participant state, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to participate actively.
As a result, no information could be obtained about which suppliers with German VAT ID would have been classified as high-risk cases.
In the selected transactions, NKU identified both normal business incidents and those suspected of USt fraud, including carousel fraud.
The FÄ was able to check high-risk transactions only to a limited extent, especially in the case of so-called "missing traders," where an examination of the documents alone is hardly sufficient to prove fraud to the taxpayer.
Suspected carousel fraud in imports and exports
It is advisable for customs and tax authorities to work more closely together in order to be able to monitor the quality of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final consumer.
Germany and a number of other countries have refused to participate actively in EUROCANET because, in their view, there is not a sufficient legal basis.
The Bundesrechnungshof found that the German financial administration uses other instruments to identify high-risk taxpayers.
However, there is a need for communication and exchange of experience between all EU Member States.
The Council of the EU agreed on a draft regulation,
Created by the EUROFISC.
The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should feed into the planned network for the fight against USt fraud.
4. Mutual assistance in the recovery of claims
Intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of claims is subject to the same European legislation in all Member States.
Requests for intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in the CZ and Germany will therefore be dealt with in the same way.
Bundesrechnungshof and NKU compared the statistics that both Member States sent to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.
These statistics contained inconsistencies.
The two courts of auditors consider it appropriate to reopen the debate on statistics at EU level in order to avoid any future disagreements.
If this is not done, the statistics cannot be used appropriately for comparisons.
In addition, the statistics should include more information on the USt.
An analysis of detailed data can make it easier for the Commission to support Member States in their efforts to combat USt fraud.
Both courts of auditors believe that Member States with a low recovery rate should strive to achieve at least the average recovery rate.
The Commission should support the Member States in this, if they so wish.
5th USt test for large companies
The courts of auditors analysed the legal situation with regard to the USt examination of large companies in both states.
In addition, they collected information from the financial authorities with a questionnaire, which they considered important in this context.
It became clear that the situation in both states is different.
The CZ has a system for selecting risky cases that includes a large amount of relevant data (including information on USt audits, balance sheet data and profit and loss accounts).
The USt control can thus be effectively controlled and analysed as a whole.
A special financial office for large companies is to be set up in 2012.
Germany does not yet have a comparable system, which makes it difficult to control and analyse the USt control as a whole.
The German financial administration concentrates more on the selection of relevant individual cases and relies in particular on data from the USt pre-registrations or USt declarations and the ZM.
Various risk management components, which are to be improved, support the evaluation of this data.
3. Examination procedure
3.1 Examination procedure in the Czech Republic
The Department II - State Budget Revenue and the Regional Departments IX Pilsen, X České Budějovice, XIII Brno and XV Ostrava audited between May 2009 and February 2010.

The Senate of the Czech Court of Auditors approved the audit findings on 27 April 2010.
3.2 Examination procedure in Germany
The audit area for traffic taxes and employees of the associated PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich audited from February 2009 to February 2010.
After selecting the examples, they announced the examination in several countries:
• Bavaria, • Hamburg, • Hesse, • North Rhine-Westphalia, • Saxony. In addition, they conducted interviews in the Federal Ministry of Finance (Federal Ministry of Finance).
Tax records from the following facies were included in the audit: • Erlangen, Zentralfinanzamt München, Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; • Hamburg-Nord, Hamburg-Hansa, Sonderfinanzamt Hamburg for large companies; • Wiesbaden I, Wiesbaden II, Darmstadt; • Essen-NordOst, FA Essen for tax audits of large companies and corporations, Lüdenscheid; • Chemnitz-Süd.

The Federal Audit Office informed the Federal Ministry of Finance of the audit results in April 2010.
3.3 Cooperation between the two courts of auditors
In the run-up to the parallel audit, the representatives of both audit institutions met in September 2008 to discuss and define the audit topics.
In December 2008, the presidents of both courts of auditors signed the agreement on co-operation in the parallel audit.
At a meeting in Bonn in June 2009, the audit teams were briefed on the initial results obtained during the preparation of the examination, discussed possible approaches to the examination and agreed on the way forward.
A second meeting took place in Prague from 2 to 4 December 2009.
The audit teams exchanged the previous audit findings and agreed on the schedule for the preparation of the joint audit report.
The two courts of auditors identified the following issues for their parallel examination: • evaluation of the recommendations made in the previous report; • review of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between CZ and German taxpayers, which could not be fully resolved during the first parallel examination; • review of selected intra-Community transactions classified as risky between CZ and German taxpayers; • examination of the procedures of the two tax administrations with regard to intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of USt claims; • USt audits of large companies.
The report on the results of the parallel examination was prepared during a working meeting in June 2010.
4. Examination of the management of sales tax in selected areas
4.1 Implementation of the recommendations of the first joint audit
4.1.1 Implementation of the recommendations in the Czech Republic
Recommendation 1
Harmonisation of the conditions for registration of taxable persons within the EU Supported
In response to the results of the first audit, the Czech Court of Auditors recommended that the requirements for VAT registration be adjusted and that new rules be introduced for the deletion of registration in the CZ.
These amended rules should more effectively reduce the risk of possible tax evasion.
In certain cases, it was found that the tax authorities did not delete the registration of taxable persons if they did not comply with their obligations under Czech law No. 235/2004 (hereinafter referred to as the "U.S. Law").
So far, the Czech Ministry of Finance has not submitted an amendment to require the FEA to be cancelled if taxpayers repeatedly fail to file USt declarations.
Under the Czech VAT Act, the FA may ex officio cancel the registration of a taxable person if (a) the taxable person has not made transactions for 12 consecutive months and has not informed the FA of the reasons for doing so; (b) the taxable person has not fulfilled his obligations under the VAT Act; (c) the taxable person no longer fulfils the conditions for tax liability.
The first examination showed that, in view of the existing legal situation, the Prague 1 FA would have to delete the USt registration of "foreign taxable persons"3 with effect from 31 January of the following calendar year, if they were not obliged to register and pay USt in the current calendar year.
The Prague 1 FA often did not delete the USt registration of these taxpayers because the relevant provision of the deadline could not be adequately implemented in practice.
The problem was solved by the amendment of the USt law, which came into force on 1 January 2009.
Accordingly, the FA has the power to delete the registration of a foreign taxable person if, in the previous calendar year, he has not provided taxable or exempt supplies of goods or services with the right to deduct.
Recommendation 2
Monthly fee of the ZM
On the basis of the initial audit, the courts of auditors recommended the introduction of the monthly levy on ZM.
The Council Directive, which reduced the rate of return for the ZM to one month, was implemented in the CZ by the USt Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.
The ZM must now be handed over electronically.
In addition, a ZM must be provided if services, the place of performance of which is to be determined in accordance with § 9 (1) of the USt Act, are provided for a person registered in a Member State other than that subject to VAT.
The condition is that the recipient is obliged to declare and pay the VAT on these services, as required by Council Directive 2008/8/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC as regards the place of the service.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of the data of the USt pre-registration and the ZM to increase the reliability of the VIES data This recommendation related to the German financial management.
In its ATIS4 system, the Czech financial administration automatically balances the data on intra-Community transactions from the USt declarations and the ZM.
Recommendation 4
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level
The proper collection of VAT is a sine qua non for the proper functioning of the EU's internal market.
That is why the fight against USt fraud is of primary interest and has received considerable attention in recent years.
The importance of this is demonstrated, among other things, by an investigation published by the European Commission in October 2009.
In it, an external expert estimated the loss of USt for the 25 Member States between 2000 and 2006. According to the analysis of the available data, the tax loss for the said period was estimated at between 90 and 113 billion euros, based on the fact that the EU-25 loses an average of 12% of the value added tax due to them each year.
The estimated tax loss for the CZ in 2006 was 18%.
The first audit found that a Member State cannot develop an effective risk management system (RMS) on its own.
Successful criteria, components or approaches for a RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each Member State.
In relation to the RMS, the Czech Court of Auditors examined the system for the exchange of information within the EU (EUROCANET).
For this purpose, risky intra-Community transactions carried out by taxpayers within the EU and recorded in EUROCANET were selected (see Chapter 4.3).
The EUROFISC network aims to optimise mutual assistance in tax matters and to combat USt fraud more effectively, and to improve cooperation between the competent authorities in order to detect fraud as early as possible.
Later, EUROFISC could be used as a tool to estimate the risk potential for intra-Community transactions.
The ECOFIN Council6 already approved EUROFISC on 7 October 2008 and at the same time adopted the principles for the functioning of the system.
EUROCANET, developed by the Belgian financial management in cooperation with the other Member States and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF7, serves as a model for EUROFISC.
The purpose of the system is to detect risky transactions and identify entrepreneurs involved in organised USt fraud.
4.1.2 Implementation of the recommendations in Germany
The evaluation of the recommendations from the first report led to the following findings:
Recommendation 1
Harmonisation of the conditions for registration of taxable persons within the EU
On the basis of a detailed questionnaire, the German tax administration has developed a well-functioning system for the registration of taxpayers.
The Federal Ministry of Finance presented this system to the Commission in October 2007.
The system itself is constantly being improved.
The data provided in the questionnaire is now collected electronically and will be available for research later on. They are therefore part of the risk management during registration.
The Commission had made a proposal 8 to amend Regulation 1798/2003, which included common standards for the registration and cancellation of taxable persons.
The Member States still needed clarification and clarification on this.
The Federal Audit Office had recommended to the Federal Ministry of Finance not to fall short of the standards already reached.
Recommendation 2
Monthly fee of the ZM
On 8 April 2010, a law 9 on the transposition of EU directives into national law was adopted.
It includes, among other things, provisions on the monthly levy of VAT on intra-Community supplies.
And will enter into force on 1 July 2010.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of the data of the USt pre-notifications and the ZM for more reliable VIES data and reflections on the merging of the previously separate procedures for filing the USt pre-notifications and the ZM
A joint federal-state working group has been set up,
Which has developed a concept for the automatic matching of data from the USt pre-registrations and the ZM.
The concept is still being discussed with the countries.
In addition, this working group has looked at a concept for optimising the control procedure for intra-Community transactions.
Recommendation 4
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level relevant information is exchanged at EU level.
Germany participates in the risk management platform.
The European Commission supported the initiative and, by written procedure of 18 October 2006, initiated the establishment of a risk management platform within the "Fiscalis 2006-2007" action plan.
The members of the platform dealt with the following topics in 4 subgroups: • risk management tools, • influencing the behaviour of taxpayers, • evaluation, • updating of the risk management guide.
New reports from the "Risk Management Instruments" and "Updating the Risk Management Guide" subgroups were published in early 2010.
4.1.3 Evaluation
Registration
The question of the requirements for USt registration and its cancellation in different countries has been dealt with at EU level.
The draft amended Council Regulation 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT and repealing Regulation (EEC) 218/92 provides for the extension of existing databases within the EU, including a database of VAT identification numbers.
This proposal also includes common standards for the registration and cancellation of taxable persons.
The questions of registration and deletion are reserved until further notice to the national legislation of the EU Member States.
The Member States still needed clarification and clarification on this.
The Federal Audit Office had recommended to the Federal Ministry of Finance not to fall behind the standards already reached.
On the final version of the draft, the Member States reached political agreement in ECOFIN on 8 June 2010.
It no longer contains common rules for the registration and deletion of taxable persons.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The two courts of auditors regret this. They still consider such regulations to be important in order to prevent VAT fraud.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Monthly fee of the ZM
With regard to international cooperation, it was recommended, as a result of the previous audit, that all Member States introduce the monthly levy of the CMD in order to allow an earlier examination of the amounts of intra-Community transactions.
Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax (VAT) for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions has reduced the rate of levying the corresponding VAT rate to one month.
In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by the amendment to the USt Act, which came into force on 1 January 2010.
Germany did not implement the commitment to the monthly ZM levy until 1 July 2010 and therefore not in time, while the CZ complied with the EU's requirements.
Comparison of the data of the USt pre-notifications and the ZM for more reliable VIES data and considerations for merging the previously separate procedures for filing the USt pre-notifications or the ZM
The German financial administration has taken up the recommendations of the Bundesrechnungshof and set up a working group to develop possible solutions.
The Federal Audit Office will monitor further developments.
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level
Germany and the CZ use different approaches to identify risky entrepreneurs.
The Czech Court of Auditors examined the application of the EUROCANET system in CZ (see section 4.3).
The Bundesrechnungshof focused on the German participation in the risk management platform.
4.2 Verification of selected intra-Community transactions
The first audit carried out a joint investigation into transactions where there were doubts as to whether they had actually been carried out or whether discrepancies had been found in the notifications of taxable persons in both Member States.
The two courts of auditors selected nine cases of intra-Community supplies of goods between the CZ and Germany for the control examination, where the tax examination by the FÄ of the Member State concerned had not yet been completed at the time of the previous joint examination.
1) 
In the first quarter of 2005, a Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth 22,686 euros from a German taxpayer.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare the acquisition in his USt statement, while the German taxpayer did not have an USt identification number, but only a tax number for intra-German transactions.
By means of international assistance pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the competent Czech FA had received information that, under German VAT law, the supplier of intra-Community goods does not need an USt identification number in order to benefit from the exemption of intra-Community supplies of goods.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that, according to the audit of the competent Czech FA, the Czech taxpayer submitted an additional USt statement declaring the purchase of goods of the above value and at the same time asserting his right to deduct the same amount of VAT.
2) 
A Czech taxpayer is said to have purchased Euro12,561 worth of goods from a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004.
However, he said he did not purchase the goods and therefore did not explain them in his USt statement.
The German financial management, citing a provision of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, refused to process the request because the turnover linked to the acquisition did not exceed the threshold of 15 000 euros.
As the Czech FA was unable to obtain documents, the tax audit was inconclusive and the original tax fix was in place.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech FA from Germany received two spontaneous reports in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, according to which the German taxpayer had invoiced the relevant goods to a Slovak addressee.
The Czech taxpayer acquired the goods from the Slovak taxpayer and announced the acquisition in its regular VAT declaration for the month of October 2004.
3) 
A Czech taxpayer is said to have purchased a car worth 48,500 euros from a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004.
However, he did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.
In addition, he had not issued an USt statement since August 2004, which is why the FA set the USt at CZK 0 for the quarter in question.
On the basis of information provided by Germany in the course of the international exchange of information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the FA asked the taxpayer in March 2007 to file a subsequent tax return, which the taxpayer omitted.
The inspection found that in 2007 the FA had carried out further examinations in this tax case, finding that the car in question had been sold by the taxpayer to a second-hand car dealer in the CZ.
The Czech FA imposed a predisposition for the tax period of December 2004, setting additional taxes of CZK 295 379 for the purchase and resale of goods from another Member State.
The competent Czech court decided to open insolvency proceedings on the assets of the Czech taxpayer; an insolvency administrator was appointed.
In the absence of significant assets, the outstanding tax liability is likely to be irrecoverable.
4) 
In the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005, a Czech taxpayer is said to have delivered new vehicles (cars) worth a total of 198 167 euros to Germany.
In response to a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, it was stated that tax proceedings were pending against the German taxpayer in Germany.
The audit carried out by the Bundesrechnungshof showed that, at the end of the proceedings, there was evidence that the German taxpayer was involved in fraud.
The intra-Community acquisition of goods was subject to income tax in the amount of EUR 182 424 (for 2004) and EUR 369 690 (for 2005).
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors revealed that the Czech taxpayer was involved in carousel fraud involving new vehicles.
On the basis of information provided by the German tax administration, a tax audit of the Czech taxpayer took place for the tax periods of April, May and June 2005.
On the basis of the audit findings and the information from the international exchange of information, the FA fixed an additional USt of 703 031 CZK for May 2005 and 726 551 CZK for June 2005.
5) 
Czech taxpayer A is said to have purchased a machine worth a total of 58 000 euros from a German taxpayer in February 2005.
In the third quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer reportedly supplied the Czech taxpayer B with a machine worth 88,027 euros. B, however, denied the acquisition.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that B had purchased the machine from a German company with a branch in the CZ.
Czech taxpayer A did not indicate the purchase of the goods from the above-mentioned German taxpayer in its USt statement.
The German FA's response to a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 showed that the German taxpayer had not made an intra-Community delivery of a machine worth 58 000 euros, but a delivery within the CZ.
In the inspection, the Bundesrechnungshof found that the intra-Community delivery of the machine was classified as a domestic delivery after the completion of an audit and the USt exemption was subsequently refused.
6) 
In the third quarter of 2004, a German taxpayer reportedly delivered goods worth 11,600 euros to a Czech taxpayer.
The goods were purchased and later sold in Germany, i.e. in 2005.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech FA had made its assessment on the basis of a supplementary USt statement, which improperly showed acquisitions from another Member State, including purchases in the above amount.
The Bundesrechnungshof found that after receiving a reply to a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the German FA corrected the VAT declaration of the German taxpayer and set an additional amount of EUR 1 600.
Due to the resale of the goods in Germany and the corresponding USt assessment there, an audit is ongoing.
The ZM of the German taxpayer has not been corrected so far, as in Germany only the taxpayer who has surrendered the ZM can correct it.
7) 
The competent Czech FA received a request for information from the German tax administration in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 on the issue of the purchase of a car worth 47,400 euros by a Czech taxpayer in February 2005.
After an audit for the 2005 tax period, the Czech FA fixed the tax liability of the Czech taxpayer at CZK 0 and informed the German FA that it could not confirm the acquisition of the car by the Czech taxpayer.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the registration of the Czech taxpayer had been cancelled because he had not complied with his tax obligations.
The Czech FA had sent the documents to the Czech police.
The German taxpayer has so far not corrected his information in the ZM, but has appealed against the tax ruling.
8) 
According to MIAS10, between the third quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, a German taxpayer supplied a Czech taxable person with a total value of EUR 33 205, which he did not declare to be an intra-Community acquisition.
The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors found that the Czech FA investigated the reasons for the disagreements.
The Czech taxpayer repeatedly issued subsequent USt statements for the first quarter of 2005.
However, the Czech FA was unable to clarify the difference in the amount of CZK 134 273 in the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005, on the grounds that sales for individual quarters could not be accurately allocated, and accepted the USt statements made.
9) 
In the third quarter of 2004, a German taxpayer had delivered goods to a Czech taxpayer worth EUR 46 854.
For the same period, the Czech taxpayer declared the intra-Community acquisition of goods worth only 14 856 euros.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the Czech FA reviewed the actual value of the delivery.
With the German answer to this question, three invoices were sent which showed a total value of the delivered goods of EUR 31 998, i.e. an amount equal to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech taxpayer and the VIES data.
According to the results of the audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors, the Czech taxpayer, after repeated reminders from the FA, submitted an ex-post statement in January 2007 for the July 2004 tax period.
With this statement, the taxpayer simultaneously asserted his right to deduct, and his tax liability for the tax period in question remained unchanged.
The audit confirmed that most of the tax procedures relating to the transactions selected for the audit had been completed and that the financial authorities in the CZ and Germany had taken appropriate measures (e.g., subsequent USt determinations or prevention of pre-tax refunds).
4.3 Examination of selected cases of risky intra-Community transactions
4.3.1 Findings in the Czech Republic
EUROCANET can be an important source of information to identify high-risk taxpayers in the Member State of acquisition.
In the CZ, the early warning information obtained from EUROCANET is checked by the competent FA with the purchasers.
Since the first quarter of 2008, the CZ has included in the EUROCANET system information on transactions and taxable suppliers that are considered risky.
Nine Czech taxpayers were selected for the audit,
Which had been entered into the EUROCANET by the financial administrations of other Member States, either as suppliers or acquirers.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Since the German financial administration did not participate in the exchange of data via EUROCANET, it was not possible to determine whether suppliers with a German VAT identification number were classified as risk-prone by the German financial administration.
The audit found both normal business incidents and those suspected of carousel fraud or other USt fraud.
In the cases in question, the FÄ exchanged information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003,
For example:
• The FÄ did not detect any suspicion of risky transactions when examining the early warning information.
The taxpayers concerned were constantly monitored because their data was stored in EUROCANET.
• In carrying out checks on risky transactions, the FÄ failed to prove, on the basis of the accounting documents submitted, breaches of the rules for calculating the tax base and VAT, even though they found discrepancies in the transport and storage of the goods or revealed business relationships with letterbox companies from other Member States.
• The review of individual business transactions was complicated because certain taxable persons did not cooperate with the FÄ and could not be contacted.
The competent authorities reviewed most of the risky taxable persons and transactions mentioned in EUROCANET's early warning reports.
However, their options for checking risky transactions, especially so-called "missing traders" are limited.
In particular, a mere examination of the documents can hardly prove that the taxpayer is acting fraudulently.
Stricter requirements for the registration of taxable persons for purposes of VAT and greater flexibility in the deletion of registrations would help to combat USt fraud.
Taxpayers involved in fraudulent carousel transactions can register for USt purposes in order to feign fictitious deliveries of goods across the EU or to issue formally correct tax receipts to other taxable persons, with which they then make unjustified claims for deductions.
In the case of suspected carousel fraud in connection with imports and exports, it is advisable for customs and tax authorities to work more closely together in order to be able to trace the nature of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final consumer.
Member States may participate in EUROCANET on a voluntary basis.
The fact that three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate was considered by the European Parliament at the end of 200811 as a weakness of the system, which should be remedied by setting up an EUROFISC network with compulsory participation.
4.3.2 Findings in Germany
The Bundesrechnungshof evaluated the data available at the Federal Central Tax Office, including those from EUROCANET.
They served as a basis for the selection of six German taxpayers whose files were reviewed.
Both Germany and a number of other countries refused to participate actively in EUROCANET.
That is why Germany has a passive status, i.e. it does not send data to Brussels itself, but is only the recipient of EUROCANET data.
This is justified by the fact that "from the point of view of the Federal Government
No unquestionable legal basis [existed] that would allow the tax secrecy existing in Germany to be broken.
In addition, the Federal Government does not have reliable information on how information sent by the Member States is processed within the framework of EUROCANET."12 Since October 2007, the Federal Central Tax Office has been evaluating the EUROCANET data and transmitting it to the federal and state tax authorities on the basis of a coordinated procedure.
The German tax authorities receive control notifications on the direct business relations of the taxable persons registered in EUROCANET with companies from other EU countries.
However, the German FA does not receive any information as to whether the company from the aforementioned other EU Member State has business relations with a company established in another Member State, which is also linked to the German company from the control notification.
4.3.3 Evaluation
The CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has only a passive status.
From the point of view of an active participant, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to participate actively.
Accordingly, the examination in this area had to be carried out in different ways.
However, there were no significant differences in the success of the detection of USt fraud. The reason for this is that EUROCANET is only one component of the risk management system.
However, the financial authorities of both countries have a variety of other tools to detect fraudulent transactions, but it is still necessary to develop a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.
The Council of the European Union agreed on a draft regulation 13, which created EUROFISC, a network for combating USt fraud.
The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should be shared by the Member States at European level and integrated into this network.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The cases brought before the courts at national and European level show that there is a need for a discussion between the Member States and the Commission on the conditions for tax exemption for intra-Community transactions.
4.4 Mutual assistance in the recovery of claims
4.4.1 Inter-governmental assistance in the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic
The legislation on intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of certain claims in the EU is essentially based on:
Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as levies and customs duties;
Council Directive 2001/44/EC amending Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as levies and customs duties and VAT and certain excise duties; and
Commission Directive 2002/94/EC laying down detailed rules for the implementation of certain articles of Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures.
The CZ implemented Council Directive 76/308/EEC by Law No 252/2000 on intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of certain claims.
After the adoption of Council Directive 2001/44/EC, it also had to be transposed into Czech law, and at the same time the aforementioned law had to be amended.
In this context, the legislative amendment No 191/2004 concerning intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of certain claims was adopted.
A new key piece of legislation was adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1179/2008 of 28 November 2008.
The annexes to this regulation contain new application forms to be used from 1 January 2009, the regulation also makes electronic transmission mandatory and requires the requesting authority to certify the conformity of all documents sent to the original.
The main principles of international mutual assistance for the recovery of claims are:
1. The principle of reciprocity applies;
2. Mutual assistance must always be provided on request and in compliance with all conditions;
3. The mutual assistance does not extend to claims which are considered to be criminal sanctions in the requested State;
4. the procedure of intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of claims must be carried out in accordance with the national law of the requested State;
5. In the recovery procedure, foreign claims do not take precedence over domestic claims;
6. The mutual assistance shall be provided only for the recovery of uncontested claims;
7. The principle of absorption applies: the requesting State must use all the means at its disposal under national law to recover the claim.
Law No 191/2004 provides for three forms of mutual assistance: the provision of information, the notification of legal acts and the actual recovery.
Procedures for outgoing requests to other EU member states
The competent FA shall transmit the request for information, the request for notification of legal acts or the request for recovery, together with the relevant documents, electronically to the CZ Ministry of Finance via the relevant financial directorate.
The Ministry of Finance of the CZ arranges the translation of the request into the language in question, scans it with all facilities and sends it via the communication network or the common interface CCN/CSI to the competent financial authority of the state in question.
A request for recovery assistance must meet the following requirement: the claim must exceed EUR 1 500 and must not be older than five years.
The requested authority may refuse recovery if the requirements are not met.
Procedures for incoming requests from other Member States
The CZ Ministry of Finance must confirm receipt of requests from other Member States as soon as possible, at the latest within seven days.
If it decides not to grant the request, it must inform the requesting authority of the reasons for the refusal, specifying the specific provisions of the directive on which it is based.
The corresponding notification must be sent no later than three months after the date of receipt of the confirmation of the request.
Upon receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance will examine whether the request meets all legal requirements.
If the request for recovery is granted, the FA will have to determine, among other things, the debtor's assets, e.g., by extracts from the land register, information on existing bank accounts and registration of vehicles with the registration office.
After six months from the date of receipt of the receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ shall inform the requesting authority of the outcome of the investigation.
The requesting authority must also be informed if the taxable persons concerned are not available and the claim cannot therefore be recovered.
All sums successfully recovered must be transferred to the requesting authority within one month of recovery.
The Czech FA, which handles the recovery, can agree on the claim hours or instalments with the consent of the requesting state.
The interest or default surcharges imposed on the debtor for the period of delay pursuant to Law No. 337/1992 on the management of taxes and fees
Stand by the requesting state.
In particular, in 2006 and 2007, the CZ's Ministry of Finance delayed sending the relevant FA the recovery requests received.
The same applies to the forwarding of requests for recovery made by the Czech authorities to the competent authority in the requested state.
The audit found that the Ministry of Finance had breached the law on intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of claims, failing to inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the state of the recovery procedure within six months of confirmation of the receipt of the request.
The situation has improved since 2008.
Statistical data
In accordance with Section 13 (4) of Law 191/2004, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ prepares statistics for the European Commission up to 15 March each year. This includes the number of requests for information, notification of legal acts and recovery, including the amount of claims received in the previous year.
On the basis of the data provided by the Member States, the European Commission prepares its report to the Council and the European Parliament on the application of the provisions on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims.
The audit revealed that in 2008 the CZ's Ministry of Finance gave the claims by 5,250,000 euros too low, due to the incorrect indication of the amount of an USt claim submitted in 2008 (caused by the postponement of a decimal point in the conversion of the Czech crowns" claim into euros).
The mistake was subsequently reflected in the European Commission's statistics.
Information on mutual recovery assistance is given in the table below.
4.4.2 Interstate assistance in the recovery of claims in Germany
The legal basis for intergovernmental assistance in tax matters is Council Directive 2008/55/EC of 26 May 2008 (EC recovery Directive) 14 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1178/2008 of 28 November 2008 (EC implementing Directive).
In order to improve readability and clarity, the EC recovery directive codified Council Directive 76/308/EEC of 15 March 197616, the provisions of which had been substantially amended several times.
Among other things, it regulates the recovery of VAT and taxes on income and property, including the associated interest, fees and surcharges.
The EC recovery directive was transposed into German law by the Expulsion Act (EC) 17 of 3 May 2003.
The enforcement procedure in Germany is regulated in the Tax Code (AO).
Section 117 (2) AO states that the financial authorities may provide intergovernmental legal and administrative assistance by virtue of international treaties and legal norms of the European Communities applicable in national law, as well as by virtue of the EC Official Assistance Act.
Part Six of the AO (sections 249-346) contains the legal provisions for the enforcement procedure.
The administrative action of the financial authorities regulates, in particular, the enforcement and enforcement orders.
The Federal Ministry of Finance agreed with the representatives of the Supreme Tax Authorities of the Länder on the principles of mutual assistance in tax matters and transferred its own competence in this area to the Federal Central Tax Office18.
The general conditions for the admissibility of a request for recovery assistance are:
• The legal requirements must be met (§§ 251, 254 AO).
• All domestically available recovery funds have been exhausted.
• The claims for which mutual assistance is requested are unquestionable.
• The period between the issue of the enforcement order or the date on which the claim or title became unassailable and the date of the request may not exceed five years.
• The claim must be at least 1,500 euros.
Procedures for outgoing requests to other EU member states The German requests for recovery of back taxes are forwarded by the enforcement authorities of the FÄ via the competent central authority and the Federal Central Tax Office of the foreign authority concerned, e.g., the Czech CLO.
The details are set out in the factsheet of 19 January 200419 on intergovernmental assistance in the collection of taxes (collection).
This fact sheet is currently being revised by a federal-state working group and adapted to the new recovery directive.
The request, along with equipment, will be forwarded electronically by the FA to the central authority.
The latter checks whether it is correct in terms of content and form.
If not, the request will be returned to the FA in question.
Otherwise, it will be sent to the Federal Central Tax Office.
The Federal Central Tax Office then takes over the necessary communication with the foreign authority in question.
Procedure for incoming requests from other EU member states
Requests for recovery from other Member States are recorded in the Federal Central Tax Office, which sends a confirmation of receipt within ten days.
It also checks whether the formal requirements are met.
In principle, the Federal Central Tax Office forwards these requests to the central authority, which directs them to the relevant FA and supervises the execution.
The Federal Central Tax Office also sends interim or final reports.
If the processing of a request takes more than six months, it reminds the Central Authority of the obligation to submit an interim report pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Directive 2002/94/EC.
After examination of the formal and factual conditions for the admissibility of the request, the enforcement authorities announce relevant measures.
All amounts recovered must be transferred to the bank account specified in the request within one month of receipt.
Statistical data
Information on mutual recovery assistance between Germany and the CZ for the years 2006 to 2008 (as of 31 December 2008).
4.4.3 Examination of selected recovery cases
A total of 21 intergovernmental requests for recovery between the CZ and Germany have been selected for the examination.
The findings are as follows:
1.
On 20 October 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German request for recovery of USt debt from a Czech taxpayer in 2004 and 2005 for a total amount of EUR 3 883 (CZK 109 820).
It was not until 26 February 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the competent FA.
In order to secure the claim to be recovered, the Czech FA charged a property belonging to the taxpayer with a basic lien.
As the contaminated land was not sufficient to pay the entire tax bill, a payment agreement of at least CZK 2,000 per month was reached with the debtor.
An interim report was sent to the German FA on 31 August 2009, according to which the taxpayer had in the meantime paid off tax debts of CZK 49,600 (as of 25 August 2009).
The amount was transferred to Germany. Shortly after, on August 28, 2009, another CZK 3,000 were transferred.
2.
On 7 January 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for the recovery of tax debts (UST, income tax) and interest and fees from a Czech taxpayer amounting to a total of EUR 180 869 (CZK 4 434 915).
It was not until 27 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the competent FA.
After reviewing bank balances, securities, real estate, motor vehicles and other movable assets, the FA found that the debtor did not have tangible assets.
On-the-spot investigations also revealed that the debtor had been absent from his permanent residence for almost a year.
His whereabouts in the CZ were unknown.
The Czech Ministry of Finance received this notification on 6 April 2009 and forwarded it to the German tax administration on 16 April 2009.
3.
On 21 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German request for the recovery of USt, together with interest and fees, amounting to a total of 3 139 euros (84 846 CZK).
It was not until 6 August 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the competent FA. On 18 February 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance from Germany was informed that the Czech tax debtor had now settled the debt.
On 9 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance informed the Czech FA that the case had been closed because the Czech tax debtor had fully paid his debt in Germany.
However, the debt was also settled in the CZ as part of the recovery procedure and the corresponding amount was transferred to Germany on 27 October 2008.
Due to the length of time it took the Czech Ministry of Finance to forward the information to the FA, the tax liability was paid twice - by the tax payer himself in Germany and by means of recovery by the competent Czech FA.
In cooperation with the Bundesrechnungshof, it was found that the amount recovered will be offset against the tax bill from another procedure, which amounts to 6 649 euros and should be transferred to the CZ in September 2008.
In the documents of the Czech Ministry of Finance, there was only a request for recovery in the amount of 3 139 euros for the company in question. The request for recovery in the amount of 6 649 euros could not be found there.
4.
On 15 September 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German request for recovery of income tax, VAT, interest and fees amounting to a total of 39 957 euros = 956 654 CZK.
It was not until 19 December 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the competent FA.
On 1 June 2009, the recovery procedure was initiated and a decision was taken to confiscate the Czech bank balance and the debtor's salary (CZK 7 000).
During the negotiations with the FA, the debtor did not agree with the amount of the tax bill and the amount was disputed.
According to the Czech FA, the debtor had in the past been willing to pay 250 euros a month, but the competent German FA did not agree.
The tax payer pledged to discuss his matter with the German FA in order to agree on a different amount.
The recovery procedure was not completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.
5.
On 19 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German request for the recovery of income tax for the year 2005 as well as VAT for the years 2003 to 2007, together with interest and fees amounting to a total of 113 444 euros = 3 116 304 CZK.
It was not until 14 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the Prague 1 FA, which is authorised to deal with tax cases of non-resident taxpayers in the CZ; on the basis of the available address, a local competent FA could not be determined.
In its investigation, on 19 September 2008, the FA received information and documents stating that the debtor's income was EUR 4 704. However, it could not issue an enforcement order because the request for recovery had been received after that date.
On 26 January 2009, the Czech FA initiated the recovery procedure and issued an enforcement order for the attachment of the debtor's assets to credit institutions.
The recovery procedure was not completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.
6.
On 3 October 2006, the competent Czech FA asked for intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of an USt debt, together with procedural costs totalling CZK 146 223 742.
It was not until 13 May 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the German financial administration.
On 8 September 2008, the competent German FA, through the Bundesbank, transferred to the Czech authorities the sum of EUR 17 700, i.e. CZK 439,226, which was recovered by bank accounts.
A conversion error was discovered during the verification of the amounts recovered.
The amount of CZK 146 223 742 was converted at the exchange rate of EUR 1 = CZK 25,065, but a comma error resulted in an amount of EUR 583 378.
The correct amount of the amount to be recovered was EUR 5 833 782.
As a result, a request for recovery, which was too low by EUR 5 250 404, has been made.
7.
On 1 March 2007, the competent Czech FA asked for recovery for an USt debt plus interest and fees from a Czech taxpayer totalling CZK 1 970 632 = EUR 79 847.
It was not until 10 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the German financial administration.
The German FA asked the debtor to pay the arrears on 4 February 2009.
Taking into account the significant reduction in the company's turnover in the second half of 2008 and in particular in the first half of 2009 as well as the corresponding liquidity situation, the following payments were made to settle the overdue tax debt. On 8 April 2009 - 4,600 euros, on 6 May 2009 -3,000 euros and on 16 June 2009 - 2,500 euros.
These payments were transferred to the account of the competent FA in the Czech Republic.
On 23 June 2009, a further payment of EUR 2 500 was agreed between the debtor and the FA until 30 June 2009.
8.
On 22 May 2008, the competent Czech FA asked for the recovery of tax debts totalling EUR 398 653 = CZK 9 832 779, including real estate tax.
It was not until 2 October 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the German financial administration.
A letter from the German financial management to the Czech Ministry of Finance dated 3 April 2009 returned the request.
The German financial management justified this on the grounds that the real estate tax was not a tax within the meaning of Article 2 (e), (f), (g) and (h) of Directive 2008/55/EC.
In addition, Article 2 (g) relates to liabilities arising from taxes on income and assets.
Accordingly, Article 3 of Directive 2008/55/EC applies to taxes on income and property not mentioned in Articles 1, 3 and 4 of Directive 77/799/EEC.
The Czech Ministry of Finance suggested that a new request for recovery should be sent to the German tax administration, which should no longer include the basic income tax arrears of CZK 61 759, but the arrears of VAT, corporation tax and income tax.
The Czech Ministry of Finance received a new request from the competent FA for the recovery of tax debts of the same taxable person amounting to CZK 7 079 735.
9.
On 6 February 2006, the competent Czech FA sent the Czech Ministry of Finance a request for recovery of income tax and VAT totalling CZK 3 445 782 = EUR 123 328.
The USt debt was CZK 1 133 967.
It was not until 18 April 2007 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the German financial administration
And it was not until 11 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance sent the Czech FA the reply of the German financial management of 9 July 2007,
On 11 June 2007, the German FA issued an enforcement order for the attachment of the bank account, stating that it was not in business contact with the above-mentioned taxpayer.
The request for the German financial management was thus deemed to have been completed.
10.
On 26 September 2005, the competent Czech FA submitted to the Czech Ministry of Finance a request for recovery of USt debt amounting to a total of CZK 1 296 845 = EUR 43 591.
The responsible financial directorate granted the request to the Ministry of Finance on 10 October 2005.
The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request to the German tax administration on 15 December 2005.
Prior to the submission of the request, the Czech FA executed the tax claim by seizing the accounts in banks and salary collection, as well as by charging a property.
Before the request for recovery, a request for information was sent to the German financial administration on 16 March 2005.
According to the letter of 16 September 2005 to the Czech FA, the Czech taxpayer was resident in Germany and had income from non-self-employed activities amounting to EUR 8 437. On 20 April 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a reply to the request for recovery and did not forward it to the competent Czech FA until 12 February 2008.
According to this, the tax liability in Germany is irrecoverable due to the debtor's inability to pay.
No assets were found, the income from non-self-employed activities was already subject to other enforcement measures.
The German financial administration considered the request to be settled.
4.4.4 Comparison and evaluation
In the case of recovery, the requirements of EU law apply to all EU Member States for intergovernmental assistance.
The procedures for processing requests are therefore similar in the CZ and Germany.
Bundesrechungshof and NKÚ have compared the statistics that the two Member States submitted to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.
In the process, disagreements emerged.
In its 200620 report, the European Commission recommended that Member States draw up their statistics with greater care.
In 200921, the Commission concluded that, despite a greater number of requests for assistance, the discrepancies in the statistics have decreased.
Both courts of auditors believe that a renewed discussion at EU level on the statistics would be useful in order to avoid the remaining discrepancies in the future.
If this does not happen, the statistics are conditionally meaningful and cannot be used for comparisons.
In addition, the Courts of Auditors consider that the statistics should indicate both the annual number of requests and the type of claims (e.g., VAT, income tax) and the amount of amounts recovered per Member State.
Through a more detailed analysis of the statistics provided by the Member States, the Commission could assist Member States in assessing their measures to combat USt fraud.
Since the recovery rate can be calculated per Member State, the courts of auditors argue that the Member States with a low quota should at least aim for the average recovery rate within the EU.
At the request of a Member State, the Commission could play an active role in this.
The foreign recovery requests received by the CZ Ministry of Finance were delayed to the competent authorities, especially in the years 2006 and 2007.
The same applies to the requests for recovery made by the Czech authorities.
The audit found that the Czech Ministry of Finance violated Act 191/2004 on intergovernmental recovery assistance in so far as it did not inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the progress of recovery measures within the six-month period from receipt of the request.
4.5 Value Added Tax Examination for Large Businesses
4.5.1 Value Added Tax Examination for Large Companies in the Czech Republic
Background
The tax procedure for large companies is subject to the same rules that apply to other taxable persons.
The examination of large companies is regulated by Czech Law No. 337/1992, the "Tax and Fee Management Act."
The Czech Ministry of Finance defines large companies as natural persons who have set up a business or legal entities which have been set up to operate a business and whose net turnover for the relevant tax period is at least CZK 2 billion according to the income or corporation tax declaration.
The taxable person is classified as a large company on the basis of the turnover level according to the income or corporation tax declaration during the respective tax period; for the first time for the year 2003.
A natural or legal person will no longer be held as a large company for the purpose of taxing sales if, in three consecutive assessment periods, their net turnover in the tax period is less than CZK 2 billion. The period begins at the end of the tax period, for which the conditions were met for the first time in accordance with the tax return.
A taxable person can only be removed from the list of large companies if at least one type of tax has been examined in advance for a period of taxation.
By the end of 2009, all large companies were audited at least every five years.
Since 2010, taxable persons have to be assessed in writing at least every two years, and the subsequent control measures are intended to eliminate the tax risks and their negative effects on the proper tax establishment and collection.
The examinations by the FEA should focus on at least one type of tax; they usually include several periods of taxation.
The large tax-paying companies were audited by the special audit bodies or audit services of the competent FÄ set up at a total of 13 FÄ.
A special audit office carried out audits in its local area of responsibility in accordance with the requirements of the head of the financial directorate.
In addition, it also examined:
Tax payers with unusual and special business activities, and
Those whose examination required a high level of expertise and time.
It also examines taxable persons with complex location distribution and organisational structure,
Taxpayers suspected of large-scale tax evasion
As well as tax payers belonging to chains and networks suspected of large-scale tax evasion and unwarranted deductions.
Information on the number of examinations carried out by the special examination bodies of the FÄ and the additional tax results of these examinations are shown in Table No. 3.
The Czech Ministry of Finance has submitted a proposal to amend Law No 531/1990 for the regional tax authorities. In particular, it is proposed to establish a special tax office with national jurisdiction for selected taxpayers (legal persons established for the purpose of economic activity, with a turnover of at least CZK 2 billion).
4.5.2 Value Added Tax Examination for Large Companies in Germany
Background
The USt examination of large companies is not particularly regulated in Germany. Audits are subject to the general regulations • the Tax Regulations (AO), • the Financial Administration Act (FVG) and • the Auditing Regulations (BpO).
There are also work aids.
Order of taxation
The provisions of §§ 193 to 203 AO "section 4 - external examination" contain, in particular, rules for the admissibility of an external examination and its factual scope, the distribution of responsibilities, the form and content of the examination announcement, the principles of the examination, the duty of participation of the taxpayer and the requirements for final interviews as well as for the transmission of the examination report.
External audits are carried out by the competent authorities (§ 195 AO).
According to § 5 paragraph 1 no. 1 in connection with § 19, it is the responsibility of the Federal Central Tax Office to participate in external audits of the FÄ.
The nature and extent of this participation will be agreed between the authorities involved.
In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office may require certain companies it has designated to be audited at a certain point in time.
In this case, it can lay down rules for the external audit of these taxpayers.
In accordance with Article 108, paragraph 7 of the Basic Law, the Examination Regulation (BpO 2000) was adopted with the approval of the Federal Council.
It applies to external audits by the state financial authorities and the Federal Central Tax Office.
According to § 3 BpO, companies are regularly classified in size classes.
Large companies must undergo a follow-up examination (Ziff. 4.2 BpO).
In accordance with section 33.1 of the BpO, each competent financial authority shall keep a list of companies within the meaning of the regulation.
Working aid for the administration
In addition, the following working aids have been issued for the administration:
• "Unified Handbook for the USt Special Examination";
• Sales Tax-Country Online - USLO (= dialogue system in the intra-Community USt control procedure) with guidance on the use of the data contained in the VIES on intra-Community business relations;
• Work aids for difficult and special situations.
• Central database for the storage and evaluation of USt fraud cases and the development of risk profiles -ZAUBER;
Taxable persons are classified in size classes based on criteria such as turnover and profit, with limits varying according to the type of business.
The figures are published by the Federal Ministry of Finance.
The values are reviewed every three years and set for the following three years.
The number of companies - not just large companies - is regularly recorded (last cut-off date: 1 January 2010).
In general, large companies must be thoroughly audited.
The tests are announced and usually extend to the USt,
In other words, the audit covers all relevant taxes, namely income tax, corporation tax, business tax and VAT.
The value-added tax can be checked either by company auditors or by USt special auditors.
The practice varies and depends on the administrative structure of the individual countries.
The number of tax periods covered by an audit generally fluctuates between three and five years.
The BpO 2000 is based on three years.
All taxes that a company has been subject to are subject to the audit.
4.5.3 Management of the VAT audit for large companies
According to the agreement, both courts of auditors did not examine individual cases. They investigated the question of how the financial authorities proceed with the USt audit of large companies.
With the help of a questionnaire, they collected information from the financial authorities, which is essential for the audit of large companies.
• What statistical records and evaluations for the USt audit of large companies are available to the management of the tax administration?
In particular:
• Are there statistics or records of how far a distinction is made between USt fraud control and general USt testing?
CZ: no, the current version of the ATIS system does not allow such a distinction.
Germany: Financial management does not distinguish between audits to combat USt fraud and general USt audits.
• Are there any statistics or records of the closeness of the exams?
CZ: information on the timing of audits of intra-Community acquisitions of selected USt purchasers is recorded in the ATIS system;
The same applies to information on the start and end of the FA's audit.
Germany: no, the statistics for auditors summarised at the federal level only contain information on the so-called average last audit period (year).
This figure does not give an overview of the audit periods selected for individual companies.
USt special auditors concentrate on the last USt assessment periods and are also authorised to audit large companies.
The federal statistics for USt special auditors do not include information on the size class of the audited company.
• There are statistics or records of the type of multi-result; for example, divided by:
I. real added value (e.g., application of a reduced rate instead of the general rate of VAT) 
II. Unreal additional income (e.g., relocation/postponement of an object not to be objected to under VAT law into another tax period) 
III. Cash effectiveness (payment of the fixed additional result) 
CZ:
The Czech tax administration monitors the number of tax audits carried out, the amount of the tax surplus broken down by type of tax, the number of taxable persons audited and the number of tax periods audited.
Other tax procedures (on-the-spot investigations, payment procedures) are monitored in the same way.
Regardless of this, the amount of late payments and the incoming payments are recorded.
Statistics on tax debts are broken down by type of tax, but no distinction is made between tax debts resulting from a tax return and those resulting from audit actions by the FA.
Germany: no, the statistics summarised at the federal level for auditors and USt special auditors do not differ according to the above criteria.
Most of the financial authorities, where local surveys were carried out, did not differentiate in this respect either.
• Are there any test fields that are likely to produce results?
CZ: Yes, the FA can select audit cases on the basis of criteria linked to selected metrics deposited in the ATIS system.
Germany: There are no federal regulations.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and USt special auditors do not provide such information.
However, the federal and state finance ministries have agreed on a common approach.
According to the report, auditors and tax investigators in the countries have to enter the extra tax income they have achieved if a certain threshold is exceeded in ZAUBER.
In this case, additional information must be provided, e.g., on the origin of the additional USt result obtained.
• What are the most common findings?
CZ:
- Large tax-paying companies have unjustifiably taken advantage of deductions for related supplies and services,
• which were not used for an entrepreneurial activity according to § 72 (1) CZ UStG;
• which were used for representation expenses in accordance with § 75 (3) CZ UStG;
• due to invoices that do not meet the requirements of § 73 (1) CZ UStG
- Tax-paying large companies have omitted the notification of USt to be paid as provided for in § 21 (1) CZ UStG.
Germany: There are no federal regulations.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and USt special auditors do not provide such information.
Findings on the USt from audits of large companies are not recorded separately by the countries.
The Federal Central Tax Office can, however, evaluate the ZAUBER database, into which auditors and tax investigators of the countries have to enter the additional tax result they have achieved if a certain threshold is exceeded.
• Does financial management analyse audit fields that are likely to produce results and draw consequences for strategic management?
CZ: Yes, for example, national audits of risky goods and industries are carried out.
Germany: There are no federal regulations.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and USt special auditors do not provide information on particularly "serious" audit fields.
With regard to the analysis of such information, the usefulness and the manner of its further use, there were different views among the survey bodies.
Some senior financial directorates provide such information to the FÄ, but the FÄ is free to use it or not.
4.5.4 Comparison and evaluation
As a result, large amounts of information are processed automatically in the CZ. For example, data from USt audits, as well as key figures from balance sheets, profit and loss accounts are processed in the system.
The CZ is able to control the selection of risky cases on the basis of a wide range of information.
The same applies to the evaluation and management of USt audits in general.
In the CZ, the establishment of a special financial office for large companies is planned for 2012.
In Germany, financial management does not collect comparable amounts of data.
Accordingly, it is more difficult to carry out these tasks in the same way.
More emphasis is placed on the selection of individual cases in this area.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
On the basis of the information in USt pre-notifications or USt declarations as well as test instructions, qualified examiners select the cases to be examined and ensure the appropriate taxation.
In order to reduce revenue losses at the USt and at the same time increase the risk of being discovered for unreliable entrepreneurs, appropriate management processes and risk management systems must be introduced.

5. Conclusions
The cooperation between the two courts of auditors has proved its worth.
It has thus been possible to gain the necessary knowledge of the systems used in both countries: in particular: • intra-Community transactions, • risk management at the USt, in particular with regard to the selection of risky transactions, • recovery of USt claims and • USt testing of large companies.
The audit revealed differences in the strategies for detecting USt fraud and in the systems explained above.
These findings can be used to improve existing procedures.
In addition, they can be used to initiate a discussion among the interested parties on which audit approaches and strategies can be used to combat fraud, e.g., the relationship within and between the Member States and the EU Commission.
The experience and knowledge gained should encourage the joint examination of the administration of the USt in the future.

Report on the results of the parallel audit of the management of the turnover tax of the Czech Republic and Germany
Foreword
The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, stresses that the courts of auditors have the power to audit all public finances.
The declaration requires the courts of auditors to have the power to examine the tax collection as much as possible.
The organisation of the European Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxes to be an important part of public revenue.
The thematic focus of the VIth EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the audit of public revenue by the courts of auditors.
One of the most important steps towards optimising the audit work of a Court of Auditors is the development of a specific strategy for the audit of public revenue.
This is especially true for taxes as the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of default.
As national economies are increasingly intertwined and interdependent, a situation may arise in which national courts of auditors can only carry out their audit work in cooperation with the courts of auditors of other states.
As an example, the investigation of internationally organized fraud can be considered, which can lead to significant revenue losses in many states.
Cooperation between the authorities is needed in the fight against such crimes.
Audit bodies in this area must be prepared to work closely with each other.
The idea for an audit of the VAT and the VIES system was developed at the VIth EUROSAI Congress in Bonn. This audit was carried out in cooperation between the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Audit Office.
In the course of a thorough preparation, the participating courts of auditors first had to familiarize themselves with the legal framework and procedures of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.
On the basis of the evaluation of the available information, we made the selection of the audit items for the audit planning.
Achieving the efficient and effective management of VAT is a long-standing problem and individual states (in particular EC Member States) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify the collection of VAT and create greater transparency in this area.
We are convinced that the results of our audit can not only contribute to improving the work of financial management, but also form the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international exchange of information.
Report on the results of the parallel audit of the management of the turnover tax of the Czech Republic and Germany
Introduction
File number: CZ) 06/27 (DE) VIII 2 - 2005 - 1215
Subject of examination:
 (CZ) Administration of VAT after the Czech Republic's accession to the European Union
 (DE) Examination of administrative cooperation in the field of VAT pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and 1925/2004
The Commission's audit objective:
 (CZ) The aim of the audit in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedures applied by the tax administration in the area of turnover tax after the integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter "EC") with free movement of goods and services, as well as the use of VIES1, in particular the control of the use of the VAT exemption for intra-Community supplies.
 (DE) The aim of the audit was to examine the system of intra-Community VAT control with a focus on administrative assistance in the area of turnover tax in accordance with the regulations mentioned above.
As a result of the audit, weaknesses should be identified and recommendations made to remedy them.
The audits were carried out jointly by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic ("NKÚ") and the Federal Court of Auditors ("BRH") of the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of an agreement concluded on 8 June 2006.
The cooperation focused on the review of selected business transactions between entrepreneurs from the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the exploitation of information obtained through international administrative assistance between the financial administrations and the comparison of the VAT administration systems in the two states.
A joint final report on the results of the audits was prepared in accordance with European guideline no. 31 for the implementation of the INTOSAI auditing standards.
The audit covered the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005.
Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel examination
The parallel audit of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two courts of auditors.
In addition to the "exchange of information" priority under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and Commission Regulation 1925/2004, other closely related issues have also been examined, such as the registration of taxable persons, tax returns and summary notifications.
In addition, the examination also covered the legal situation for cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach and the comparison of statistical data.
When comparing the systems of VAT administrations in the two states, differences were found in the following areas:
1) Registration for VAT purposes.
While in Germany, entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among others, the essential criterion for registration is exceeding the turnover threshold laid down in the VAT Act.
In the Czech Republic, taxpayers only receive a single tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, the taxable person receives a tax number only applicable to domestic transactions for the purposes of sales tax.
If the German taxpayer wants to make intra-Community transactions, he must request the grant of a special identification number, the so-called USt-IdNr.
As problems arise from the different registration procedures, the rules should be harmonised within the EC (see 4.1).
2) Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach.
In the Czech Republic, the international carriage of passengers by bus and coach is exempt from VAT, but there is a right to deduct VAT.
In Germany, the transport service, as far as the route passes through Germany, is subject to VAT.
Efforts should be made at EC level to unify the situation under Article 393 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of turnover taxes (see 4.2).
3) Tax returns.
Whereas in the Czech Republic, taxable persons are required to file VAT returns only for periods of less than one year (month or quarter), taxable persons in Germany (monthly or quarterly) 
VAT pre-registrations and a VAT annual declaration after the end of the calendar year.
In contrast to the Czech Republic, tax payers in Germany have to submit their VAT registrations electronically.
The introduction of the mandatory electronic filing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of Czech financial management (see 4.3).
4) Summary messages.
While taxpayers in the Czech Republic have to submit their summary notifications to the tax authorities (FÄ), German taxpayers have to submit the summary notifications to the CLO2.
Accordingly, the information from the summary notifications will be available to the FÄ in the Czech Republic immediately after their submission.
The information from the summary notifications will only be available to the German authorities after they have been processed by the CLO.
In order to combat VAT fraud, updated information on intra-Community transactions is needed as soon as possible.
The monthly submission of summary notifications would shorten the period between the date of the turnover and the update of the VIES data.
This would allow for a timely assessment of taxation in the acquirer's Member State (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduce the same time limits.
5) International exchange of information in the area of sales tax.
In the case of in-depth requests for information, the Czech CLO monitors compliance with the three-month period.
The German CLO does not monitor the processing times.
As a result, the German financial administration has completed a significantly lower percentage of requests for information within the prescribed period.
Because of these problems, the BRH has recommended to the German CLO a permanent monitoring of the deadlines (see 4.6).
6) Risk management.
Each of the two Member States is in the process of developing its own risk management system (RMS) with corresponding strengths and weaknesses.
The NKÚ and the BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by one Member State alone.
Successful criteria, elements or approaches of a RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EC Member States. Otherwise, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5.).
As part of the cooperation, the two courts of auditors examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions carried out between Czech and German tax subjects.
Of these, 31 cases were jointly reviewed using CLO's legal options, where there were doubts about the correct taxation or the suspicion of VAT fraud.
The Courts of Auditors found that:
In some cases, the FÄ took advantage of the information obtained in the international exchange of information and re-established the VAT liability of the taxable persons concerned.
In these cases, the taxable persons either unlawfully claimed the VAT exemption or did not declare the purchase of goods in their VAT declaration.
In some cases, the FÄ could not use the information obtained in the exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used because of different legal requirements in the two Member States.
In some cases, the financial management of another Member State refused to provide the requested information.
A number of cases have been uncovered in which tax payers have inaccurately reported transactions in their summary reports.
As a result, the data in the VIES were accordingly incorrect, so that the clerks (the FÄ) had to investigate in these cases (see 6).
Examination procedure
Examination procedure in the Czech Republic
The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by Department II - "State Budget Revenue" and the territorial audit departments of Central Bohemia, North West Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and Northern Moravia.
Audited positions were: Ministry of Finance and 10 FÄ Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadaň, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Třinec.
The College of NKÚ approved the examination findings on 23 April 2007.
Examination procedures in Germany
The audit was carried out in the period July 2006 to February 2007 by the audit area of traffic taxes and employees of the associated PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich.
It was part of the work plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006.
After a test phase, the actual test began in the 4th quarter of 2006.
According to the cases selected by the BRH and later by the NKÚ, the BRH had to announce the examination in several federal states.
Apart from interviews in the BMF and the CLO, the examination was carried out in the following federal states:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
Tax records from the following cases were included in the audit:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, München-Körperschaften, Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nord and Hamburg for large companies, Hannover-Nord, Winsen-Luhe, Bonn-Innenstadt, Cologne-Mit Cologne-Porz, Cologne-South, Sankt Augustin, Pirmasens, Bautzen, Chemnitz-South, Dresden II, Freiberg, Leipzig I and Zschopau.
In addition, talks were held with the FÄ Augsburg-Stadt, Aurich, Düsseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.
The results of the examination were communicated to the BMF in May 2007.
Cooperation between the two courts of auditors
In the run-up to the parallel audit, several meetings were held between representatives of both courts of auditors.
Participants in these meetings familiarized themselves with the organization of financial management, the legislation on sales tax and the system of sales tax administration in the other country.
The subject of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006.
The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.
At this meeting, a timetable for the further procedure was drawn up and the following examination topics were identified for the parallel examinations: 1.
Registration of taxable persons.
2.
International carriage of passengers by bus and coach - legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.
3. International exchange of information, in particular the action of the tax officials in the processing of requests for information and the review of selected problem cases mentioned in the requests for information, as well as spontaneous information between the Czech Republic and Germany.
4. Tax returns.
5.
Summary notifications.
6.
Statistical information on deliveries and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany.
7. Risk management in the VAT area.
At a meeting to coordinate the further examination of the NKÚ and the BRH in December 2006, both sides familiarised themselves with the examination procedure in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of the parallel examinations already achieved.

An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic, whose turnover in the last 12 consecutive calendar months exceeds the amount of 1,000,000 CZK, will be liable for payment on the first day of the third month after the month in which he has exceeded the threshold (§ 94 (1) of Law No. 235/2004 Coll., concerning VAT; hereinafter "Law No. 235/2004").
The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he has exceeded the registration threshold.
The current legislation does not allow the retroactive registration of a taxpayer who has exceeded the registration deadline.
A businessman with a legal seat, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic who provides services subject to VAT or services exempt from VAT with the right to deduct VAT must register for VAT even if his turnover does not exceed CZK 1 million, but he fulfils other conditions mentioned in Law No 235/2004.
An entrepreneur with a legal seat, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic, who does not meet any of the requirements laid down in the law, can voluntarily apply for registration for VAT.
The registration procedure pursuant to Law No. 337/1992 begins with the receipt of the application for registration by the local tax official.
If you want to register voluntarily for sales tax, you have to indicate in your application the date from which you apply for registration as a sales tax.
The financial officer has to check the information provided by the entrepreneur, i.e. the completed application for registration with all investments.
If he has doubts about the information given therein, he has to ask the applicant to explain, supplement or prove the information given.
If the financial officer has verified that the trader fulfils the conditions for registration, he has to give a written opinion on the registration and the allocation of a tax number.
In the communication, the tax official has to indicate the date of entry into force of the registration of the turnover tax and the assessment period for the sales tax.
The predisposition period is the calendar quarter, unless the entrepreneur's turnover for the previous calendar year has reached the amount of at least 10,000,000 CZK.
If this is the case, the predisposition period is the calendar month.
An entrepreneur whose turnover reached at least CZK 2,000,000 in the previous calendar year is entitled to choose the calendar month as a predisposition period and has to inform the tax officials of this change.
The issue of a tax number in the registration notice is always constitutive.
The taxable person must provide the tax number in every communication (including payments) with the tax official, and in cases where a special law requires it (e.g., Law No. 235/2004, concerning the preparation of tax documents) 3.
The tax number contains the coding "CZ" and a basic component in the form of a general identification mark.
In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or another general identification mark, to the extent specified by a special law. In the case of legal persons, the general identification mark is the company identification number (according to the provisions of Section 33 (12) of Law No. 337/1992).
If the entrepreneur has not fulfilled his obligation despite the appropriate request from the finance officer, the local finance officer has to register him ex officio.
A communication will also be issued to the taxpayer.
In the Czech Republic, every business-approved entrepreneur receives a tax number on his first registration for any type of tax.
This also applies to registration as a VAT payer.
Pursuant to Law No. 235/2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, in the event of non-compliance with the duty to register the turnover tax, the tax payer may demand that up to 10% of the proceeds of the taxable transaction, which the person concerned has unlawfully made without taxation, for the period from the date on which the trader should have been registered as a taxable person, until the date on which registration as a taxable person is made available by the tax officials took place (§ 98 (1) of Law No. 235/2004).
The payment of the fixed amount is considered a tax payment within the meaning of Section 98 (3) of Law No. 235/2004, i.e. it is not a fine or penalty.
If the legal requirements are met, the registration of a taxable person can be deleted for two reasons:
1) 
Cancellation of registration at the request of the taxpayer, i.e. mainly for the reason that the turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (§ 106 (1) of Law No. 235/2004).
A taxable person may request the deletion of his registration at the earliest one year after the date of entry into force specified in the registration notice.
2) Cancellation of registration ex officio (§ 106 (7) of Law No. 235/2004) if: a) the taxable person has not performed for 12 consecutive months and has not informed the tax officials of the reasons for this, b) the taxable person has not fulfilled his obligations under Law No. 235/2004, c) the former taxable person no longer fulfils the requirements for tax liability.
B) Taxable persons without a legal domicile, registered office or business premises in the Czech Republic A person who is registered for tax purposes in another Member State and does not have a legal domicile, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic or a taxable foreigner who provides services in the Czech Republic and who, in accordance with Section 108 of Law No. 235/2004, has to file a tax return and pay taxes for these services or deliveries ("non-resident entrepreneur ") the provision of the service in question is subject to tax.
He must apply for registration with the Prague 1 FA at the latest on the day of the delivery in question.
It is obliged to indicate in this application all VAT IDs allocated to it in other Member States or third countries.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration later than on the day of the first taxable supply of services in the Czech Republic, the Prague 1 FA has to register him retroactively, since he became subject to VAT in accordance with Law No. 235/2004 on the day of the first taxable supply of services in the Czech Republic.
In the event of a retroactive registration, the Prague 1 FA must request proof (invoices or written explanations) of the performance from the operators concerned.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration in the Czech Republic before the first performance of a service, the Prague 1 FA has to request the submission of the performance-based contract documents.
As of December 31, 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with the Prague 1 FA, of which 124 were from Germany. As of December 31, 2005, a total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered, of which 233 were from Germany.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 106 (9) of Law No. 235/2004, the tax official is entitled to cancel the registration of a non-resident entrepreneur on 31 January of the following calendar year if he does not accept the obligation to file tax declarations or declarations and to pay taxes.
During the examination of the NKÚ, it turned out that in the case of filing a tax return by post with dispatch abroad on 25 January, i.e. according to the mandatory deadline for filing a tax return, this statement has not yet been received by the FA until 31 January.
In cases where these facts, which are relevant for the possibility of cancellation of the registration, become known to the FA later than 31 January, it is no longer possible to cancel the registration of the non-resident businessman for VAT in the Czech Republic in the calendar year in question.
Registration of taxable persons in Germany
In accordance with the provisions of the tax regulations (§§ 137, 138 AO), every business must be registered with the municipality and/or the competent tax office.
This notification must be made no later than one month after the start of the business.
The municipality forwards the application to the tax authorities.
If the competent tax office finds that a business activity has started but has not been registered, it can also register the taxable person ex officio retroactively.
In Germany, tax payers, regardless of whether they are resident or not, are obliged to register for Zwekke's sales tax if they meet the requirements of Section 2 of the German VAT Act (UStG).
This does not depend on the amount of sales generated.
There is no voluntary registration in Germany.
For foreign-based entrepreneurs, special funds are in charge.
For example, the FA ChemnitzSüd is responsible for those entrepreneurs who are based in the Czech Republic.
As of April 30, 2004, the total number of registered Czech entrepreneurs was 295; as of March 1, 2006, 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered there.
According to the BRH, these bodies with special responsibilities often refused to register so-called bogus self-employed persons residing in the new Central and Eastern European Member States of the EC.
Since, after the accession of these ten countries to the European Community, the free movement of workers is still restricted, these self-employed people tried to circumvent these restrictions by setting up their own business.
These employees do not fulfil the conditions laid down in § 2 UStG for recognition as entrepreneurs, as they are usually dependent on a single client who determines their working time and the type of work carried out.
In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must fill in a questionnaire from the competent FA and provide information on the company and the business activities carried out.
The questionnaire is a mandatory form for all FÄ in Germany.
It is processed either in special organisational units within the Agency or in the organisational units generally responsible for tax assessment.
With the help of this form, a risk assessment is carried out for the individual taxpayer prior to the allocation of a tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions is based on certain requirements:
The first three digits are the identification number for the responsible FA, The following three (or four) digits indicate which department is responsible within the FA, The following five (or four) digits are the identification number for the taxpayer, the last digit is always a control digit.
If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-Community trade, he needs a VAT ID number in order to be able to make tax-free intra-Community deliveries.
This is allocated by the CLO on request, if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany for sales tax purposes.
The VAT ID number is automatically allocated by the CLO if the taxable person declares intra-Community supplies in his VAT registrations or in his annual VAT declaration.
The USt-IdNr. Is composed of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.
The registration of an entrepreneur can be deleted: 1. On request (e.g., if he stops doing business), but only after the completion of all tax transactions (the predisposition of all financial years) or 2. if the financial management determines that he no longer runs a business.
As a rule, the validity of the VAT ID number depends on the validity of the VAT number.
In these cases, the FÄ must inform the CLO of the deletion of the VAT number so that the validity of the VAT ID number can be terminated there at that time.
According to the value added tax law (§ 19 (1) UStG), domestic taxpayers do not have to pay sales tax in the following cases: 1. the turnover of the previous calendar year plus the resulting sales tax has not exceeded the amount of 17,500 Euroand 2. is unlikely to exceed the amount of 50,000 Euroin the following year.
The so-called small entrepreneurs are not entitled to charge VAT to other entrepreneurs, nor are they entitled to deduct VAT.
Although they do not have to pay sales tax, small business owners are required to register with the tax office and file an annual sales tax return.
A small business owner can explain the non-application of § 19 (1) UStG.
This declaration is binding for the following five years.
He is then allowed to charge the sales tax and deduct the pre-tax.
Non-resident taxpayers can appoint a fiscal representative (§ 22a UStG).
The prerequisite for this is that they only make tax-free sales and refrain from deducting VAT.
The fiscal representative fulfils the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur, so that he does not have to register for VAT purposes.
The invoices indicate that a fiscal representative has been appointed.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation in the two states is different.
While in Germany, entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first requirement for registration (among others) is the excess of the threshold amount specified in the VAT Act.
If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he can register voluntarily.
The registration procedure in Germany is standardised, but differences can occur due to different organisational structures in the individual federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the taxable person receives a tax number for any tax at the time of his first registration.
In the case of its registration for VAT, this tax number also applies to intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, an entrepreneur who registers for sales tax purposes receives a tax number exclusively for intra-German sales.
If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must specifically request the allocation of a VAT ID number.
Both NKÚ and BRH found that the German two-tier registration system could lead to significant misunderstandings in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which provides a single identification number for both national VAT registration and intra-Community transactions.
On the other hand, the two-tier system allows for retroactive (national registration) in cases where the taxpayer does not register his business with the municipality or the competent FA.
This retroactive registration allows an accurate assessment of the value added tax for previous assessment periods, in particular an accurate estimate of the value added tax liability.
As the different registration procedures lead to problems, the rules should be harmonised for the whole EC.
The German Parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number.
This is to be allocated by the Federal Central Tax Office to every natural person after birth.
This number applies to natural persons resident in Germany for life.
If a natural person starts a business, the competent FA will apply for a commercial tax identification number that serves as a VAT ID number.
In the future, therefore, there should be no delay between the national registration of a taxable person and the allocation of the VAT ID number.
Work on the implementation of an IT procedure for the management of numbers has not yet been completed.
International carriage of passengers by bus and coach
The legal regulations in the Czech Republic
According to the provisions of Section 70 of Law No. 235/2004, since 1 May 2004, the carriage of passengers between the individual Member States and between the Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic has been exempt from VAT and there is a right to deduct VAT.
The exemption from VAT applies even if the transport is carried out by persons registered as taxable persons in other Member States or by foreigners who are subject to tax in their own country.
The return journey is considered to be a separate transport operation.
If non-resident entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic do not carry out any economic activity other than the cross-border carriage of passengers by bus and coach, they are not obliged to register in the Czech Republic as subject to VAT.
Cross-border passenger transport in the Czech Republic has been exempted from VAT in accordance with the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Annex V, Chapter 5 (1) (b).
"For the purpose of applying Article 28 (3) (b) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Czech Republic may, in accordance with point 17 in Annex F of the Directive, maintain the tax exemption for cross-border passenger transport either until the condition of Article 28 (4) of the Directive is met or until the same tax exemption is applied by any of the current Member States."
The legal regulations in Germany
According to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006, as implemented in Germany by Section 3b (1) of the UStG, a transport service is carried out where the transport is effected.
Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and cross-border passenger transport.
Only the domestic part of the transport service is subject to tax in Germany.
German taxation also does not distinguish between resident and non-resident (bus) entrepreneurs.
If a non-resident taxable person moves through Germany, the part of the transport that is attributable to Germany is considered to be a taxable transport.
Before providing its services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must notify the competent FA of his intention to provide passenger transport services.
This registers it for tax purposes (compare 4.1.2) and gives a special certificate for each bus and coach named in the taxpayer's application.
The entrepreneur has to declare his taxable transport services in a German VAT declaration.
As of 1 March 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered with the Chemnitz-Süd FA.
If the transport service is provided to a domestic operator, the non-resident taxpayer does not have to pay the VAT himself to the FA.
In its place, the domestic customer of the services has to pay the VAT to the tax office and the invoiced net amount to the non-resident taxpayer, which is referred to as "the transfer of the tax liability" and is in accordance with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.
In addition to the registration by a non-resident taxpayer and his income tax return, the German tax administration has several means of verifying the accuracy of the tax return in respect of taxable passenger transports:
Mobile customs control groups check the certificates of buses registered abroad, which are used for passenger transport through Germany.
After each inspection, the mobile control groups submit an inspection report to the responsible FA.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group can require the bus driver to pay the VAT before continuing his journey.
The non-resident taxpayer can deduct the VAT paid in this way from the tax liability stated in his VAT return.
If the FA has doubts about the accuracy of a VAT return, it can order an audit to be carried out in the FA, or it can use the means of mutual assistance referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 (see point 4.6).
Even if the foreign taxable person refuses to pay the legally established turnover tax, the FA may request assistance in accordance with Council Directive 76/308/EEC.
The BRH considers these means of mutual assistance in tax matters for checking the VAT return or compliance with the tax obligation by a non-resident bus operator to be too burdensome in relation to the small amount of VAT on taxable passenger transports.
In particular, the examination of the books of a non-resident taxpayer incurs disproportionately high costs for the taxpayer himself and for financial management.
The latter must examine foreign books, which requires knowledge not only of the foreign language, but also of foreign accounting principles.
Accordingly, the time required for such an examination is higher than for a resident taxable person, although the examination is limited to the passenger transports taking place in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident taxpayer must accept not only the audit rights of his national financial management, but also those of the other Member States, as far as he carries out passenger transports there.
In addition, for each Member State in which a single passenger transport is carried out, the taxable person must fulfil all existing tax obligations in the various languages and on the basis of the forms of the financial services of the EC Member States concerned.
This means that the correct taxation of cross-border passenger transport services will result in a disproportionate administrative burden.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation is different in the two states.
In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between different EC Member States, as well as between Member States and third countries, is exempt from VAT under the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic to the EC.
In Germany, the transport service is subject to a turnover tax in accordance with the transport route, which is part of the German territory.
If a non-resident taxpayer provides such a transport service for the first time, he must notify the relevant FA in advance.
This registers the taxable person, who must declare the taxable share of the transport service in a tax return in Germany.
The law enforcement in Germany is very time-consuming.
At least three out of four Czech taxpayers registered with the Chemnitz-Süd FA have passenger transport as a business purpose.
The tax revenue in question is quite low in relation to the administrative burden.
Member States - which collect VAT under Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax - have a high administrative burden in relation to the relevant tax revenue.
In order to avoid the disproportionate cost of VAT, cross-border passenger transport should only be subject to tax in one Member State.
This could be the state where the transport begins or where the service provider is located.
Such a form of taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006.
VAT returns
Filing and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic
Unless otherwise specified by the law, even if no tax liability has been incurred, the entrepreneur is obliged to file a VAT return on the form specified by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the end of the tax period.
The tax liability arises at the end of the period for the filing of the VAT return. Except for this regulation, according to law No. 235/2004, the value added tax is on the import of goods. Here, the due date of the tax is determined according to the customs regulations.
If, as a result, an above-average amount of deductible tax is claimed for a refund, this amount will be refunded to the taxpayer within 30 days of the determination of the deductible, without having to make an application for it.
The time limit is not applied in cases where the tax officer initiates a tax procedure with regard to the taxable person's tax liability.
Pursuant to Section 73 (11) of Law No. 235/2004, the right to deduct VAT can be asserted at the latest with the regular tax return for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the right to deduct VAT has arisen.
At the end of this period, the deduction can still be claimed within three years of the end of the tax period during which the claim would have been possible for the first time.
In order to do this, however, a supplementary declaration of VAT is required.
An amendment to Law No. 235/2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, allows the filing of a supplementary VAT declaration only for the period during which the right to deduct VAT could have been asserted for the first time.
A taxable person must file a supplementary VAT return if: (a) the sum of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax liability, (b) he makes corrections which do not alter the last known tax liability, but only change previous information, (c) he makes corrections to the VAT rate and the tax liability in accordance with Section 49 of Law No 235/2004.
A taxable person may file a supplementary VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax liability.
The taxable person must file the supplementary tax return by the end of the month following the month in which the facts were established.
The sales tax declaration can be submitted electronically either via the Internet or by means of data carriers.
The submission via the Internet can be done with a certified electronic signature or without it.
If it is done without an electronic signature, it must also be submitted on data carriers.
The form for the VAT return contains separate lines for the indication of the value of intra-Community supplies and purchases.
The value of related services must be stated in separate lines of the VAT return.
Some sections are used for automated primary controls under the ATIS system.
The value of the goods delivered to other EC Member States to persons registered there as taxable persons is compared with the data provided by Czech taxpayers in their summary notifications.
The value of purchases of goods from other Member States from persons registered there as taxable persons is compared with the information in the summary notifications of taxable persons from other EC Member States with the help of VIES.
Within the framework of the ATIS system, a credibility check of VAT returns is carried out at the FA.
This is done automatically, as the VAT return cannot be processed without the prior check.
The credibility test includes a calculation of the standards of credibility and an assessment of the risks of VAT returns.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 37 (1) of Law No. 337/1992, the FA can repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who do not comply with their non-monetary duties under this or a special tax law or a decision under this law.
Automated tax information system - Automated tax information system used by Czech tax authorities to provide technical support for tax collection.
The NKÚ found during its examination that the FÄ rarely made use of the possibility of imposing a fine on the tax payer in case of non-payment of the VAT declaration.
Filing and processing of VAT returns in Germany
In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly VAT pre-registrations and the annual VAT return.
Those taxpayers who are required to file VAT pre-notifications will still have to file an annual VAT return.
Even small business owners, who are not obliged to pay the sales tax, have to make an annual sales tax declaration.
The taxable persons are, in principle, obliged to file a preliminary VAT registration by the 10th day after the end of the calendar quarter in which the turnover tax is generated (§ 18 (2) of the German Stock Corporation Act).
However, if the VAT liability is more than Euro6,136 in the previous year or if it is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur is obliged to file monthly VAT pre-notifications no later than the 10th day after the end of the month in question.
The taxable person can also opt for the filing of monthly VAT pre-registrations if he has received a refund of Euro6,136 in the previous year (§ 18 (2a) UStG).
If the annual turnover tax is not more than Euro512, neither VAT pre-registrations nor VAT returns are to be made.
A resulting VAT liability is to be paid 10 days after the end of the tax period.
A refund can lead to a more thorough audit by the financial management.
 (legal) deadlines for the processing of VAT returns and for the refund of VAT overpayments do not exist.
In order to receive a timely refund, a security for the refund amount can be offered.
In principle, VAT returns, including reimbursement cases, must be processed expeditiously.
The German VAT Act allows an extension of these (delivery or payment) costs (§ 18 (6) UStG).
The extension of the deadline must be requested separately.
If it is granted, the VAT pre-registration and the corresponding payments may be made one month later. However, in the case of monthly notifications, a special advance payment must be made for this.
This payment will be offset against the VAT liability established for the pre-notification period of December.
If an error is detected, the trader must file a corrected VAT pre-registration.
There is no "additional" VAT return.
Once the VAT return, which must be submitted by 31 May of the following year, has been submitted to the tax office, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect VAT pre-notification, but only the incorrect annual VAT return.
Corrections of this VAT return to the taxpayer's advantage or disadvantage are possible within four years after the end of the year in which the first VAT return was issued.
After the end of this four-year period, a VAT return can usually only be corrected in cases of a frivolous tax cut or tax evasion.
Taxable persons are required to file VAT pre-notifications by electronic means.
The FÄ can grant exceptions to this rule in order to avoid undue hardship.
The annual VAT return can be issued either in paper form or via the Internet with or without certification.
If the tax is not certified, the taxpayer must also make the declaration on paper and with his personal signature.
If no VAT pre-notifications or declarations are made, the financial management is entitled to make a rough estimate of the turnover achieved by the taxpayer6.
In the event of a late levy, the taxable person may be subject to a late payment (up to 10% of the tax bill or up to an amount of Euro25,000).
In a previous audit, the BRH found that the FÄ often do not charge this delay surcharge.
In cases where the FÄ collected the delay surcharges, the amount was determined inconsistently and arbitrarily.
The delay surcharge therefore misses its purpose of reducing the average delay, in particular in the filing of the annual VAT return.
The form of the VAT return contains separate lines for value information on intra-Community deliveries or purchases.
There are also separate lines for the provision of services.
Non-taxable sales must be stated in a separate line of the VAT declaration.
The VAT returns filed on paper must either be scanned or electronically recorded by specially designated personnel.
The data of electronically filed tax returns are directly available to the financial administration.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
According to which all data is electronically recorded, they are subjected to a risk management procedure and a case selection is made on the basis of certain standards.
The VAT returns selected in this way must be checked by the responsible clerk on the basis of the automatically generated test notices (see 5.2).
Although the financial management only has to make a rough estimate of the VAT liability, it still has to be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, taxable persons must submit their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the end of the tax period.
Depending on the taxable person's turnover, the tax period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
In Germany, taxable persons have to file their previous applications at the latest 10 days after the end of the calendar quarter or the calendar month, depending on the amount of their tax liability in the previous year.
The annual VAT declaration must be submitted no later than 31 May of the following year.
The obligation to issue an annual VAT return has some advantages and disadvantages:
+ At the end of the calendar year, the taxpayer can correct the errors in the monthly pre-registrations by filing a single VAT return;
- If the taxable person reports his information on intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be attributed to a specific reporting period of the cm;
- The federal states do not share VIES data on intra-Community acquisitions of German taxpayers until the annual turnover tax declarations have usually been processed.
According to the registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs must submit a VAT declaration regardless of the amount of their turnover.
This tax obligation enables the German financial administration to check compliance with the sales ceiling for small business owners.
In addition, the competent FA can compare the annual sales tax declaration with the corresponding declarations for direct taxes and with the annual accounts of the company in question.
In the Czech Republic, the financial management can only check the amount of the turnover on the basis of the income tax return.
In contrast to the current regulations in the Czech Republic, German taxpayers are obliged to pay the VAT pre-registration electronically.
The introduction of the duty of electronic filing of the tax return in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of Czech financial management.
Summary notifications
Filing and processing of summary notifications in the Czech Republic
In accordance with the provisions of Section 102 of Law No 235/2004, a trader who supplies goods to a person registered in another Member State for tax purposes has to make corresponding summary notifications (hereinafter referred to as "ZM").
The value of the goods delivered is always stated in Czech currency in the Central Bank, broken down according to the VAT IdNr7, the individual taxable persons under which they are registered in the other Member State.
Information on services is not provided in the ZM.
The taxable persons with a calendar monthly or quarterly period of taxation have to hand over the ZM to the local FA no later than the 25th day after the end of each quarter.
Incorrect data must be corrected in a correction ZM within 15 days of the detection of the error.
Incorrect data in the ZM are always replaced by the data from the correction ZM.
Similar to the tax returns, tax payers can also hand over the ZM electronically.
If a taxable person does not issue a ZM or correction ZM, even though he is obliged to do so under Law No. 235/2004, the tax official shall ask him to surrender the ZM in question, pointing out the consequences of the non-delivery. In the event of non-monetary duties, the tax official shall be entitled to impose repeated fines of up to CZK 2 million in accordance with Section 37 of Law No. 337/1992.
The NKÚ found during its investigation that the FÄ mostly did not use its power to impose fines on its delinquent taxpayers.
In particular, in the case of the surrender of the ZM, the taxable persons are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their duties, since the failure to surrender a ZM does not affect the amount of their VAT liability.
Pursuant to Section 102 (5) of Law No. 235/2004, the tax officer is obliged to check the information in the ZM or Amending ZM, to remove all ambiguities and to use the information to determine the tax liability.
In case of non-conformity
8 of the information in the ZM with which The taxable person corrects false information in the ZM by submitting a correction ZM either on his own initiative or upon request.
The financial officer has to correct the data on deliveries of goods to other Member States in the ATIS system if:
- The taxpayer does not prove the accuracy of the information reported in the ZM (or correction ZM) and therefore corrects it by submitting a correction ZM,
- The tax official has demonstrated the inaccuracy of the information reported by the taxpayer in the ZM or correction ZM.
Corrections entered by the tax officer, without the taxpayer having made a correction, do not replace the duty of the tax payer to make a correction, but only lead to the correction of the data in the VIES, so that they are up-to-date, complete and accurate.
The data from the CMMs will be sent to the Member States concerned.
Only the national tax authority designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the area of VAT is allowed to transmit and receive this data.
This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic, this function is performed by the Department of International Administrative Assistance in the field of VAT in the Ministry of Finance) and the "O_MCTL" message is automatically received by the CLO from the other Member States.
It contains all incorrect USt IdNr. Specified in the transmitted ZM lines.
If the incorrect USt-IdNr. Is used in some of the transmitted lines of the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry is entered in the list of false USt-IdNr.
The list contains a "report of doubts concerning USt-IdNr."
The financial officer checks the data and enters the result of the review into the system.
When purchasing goods from another Member State, the taxable person must state this in his VAT return and enter the value of the purchase in the lines of the VAT return specified for it.
Selected cases of differences between the value of the purchases made by the Czech taxpayer in his VAT return and the value of the goods supplied by the supplier from the other Member State in his VAT return will be forwarded by the CLO to the competent FA for examination.
The clerks there must investigate the deviations.
There can then be three different situations:
A) The value indicated by the Czech buyer in the relevant sections of his VAT return is lower than the value of the deliveries indicated by suppliers from other EC Member States.
In this case, the financial officer checks the accuracy of the information.
B) The difference is zero.
This situation can be caused either by a change in the information within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects his ZM) or by a change in the information in the VAT return (the Czech taxpayer in the meantime gives an additional VAT return on his own initiative).
In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax official to check the accuracy of the information in the VAT return anyway.
C) The value of goods purchased from other Member States, as indicated by the Czech taxpayer in his VAT return, is higher than the value of the goods supplied by the suppliers of the other EC Member States.
Here, in turn, it is up to the Treasury official to check the accuracy of the information.
After reviewing the differences and clarifying the reasons for their occurrence, the Treasury official gives the results of his review in ATIS.
These results will be forwarded to the CLO.
The number of transactions sent by the CLO for examination can be seen for the individual quarters of 2005 from graph no. 1 (source: Czech Ministry of Finance).
Graph 1 above shows that the number of cases reported by the CLO has decreased for the individual quarters of 2005.
The significant reduction in the number in the 4th quarter of 2005 is due, among other things, to the fact that the Czech CLO has raised the threshold for a case selection, taking into account the minimum threshold for a request for information to the other EC Member States.
Deviations between the information in the VAT returns and the data from the EC do not always have to be based on a fault of the domestic buyer.
There may also be an error on the part of the taxpayer in another Member State, or an error caused by the fact that in the individual EC Member States, certain types of supplies are indicated differently in the CMD.
The most common reasons for deviations in the value of reported business transactions found in the audited business transactions are shown in Table 1.
Filing and processing of the summary notifications in Germany
Traders who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EC Member States or take part in triangular transactions are required to make quarterly ZMs listing intra-Community deliveries to purchasers (§ 18a (1) UStG).
The ZM must be surrendered no later than the 10th day of the month following the calendar quarter in question.
If a long-term extension is granted for the filing of VAT pre-notifications, this also applies to the ZM.
The ZM must be handed over to the CLO.
The electronic levy has been mandatory since 1 January 2007.
The competent FA may allow exemptions for individual taxpayers in order to avoid undue hardship.
If the taxpayer finds that the ZM was faulty, he is obliged to issue a correction ZM within one month.
In the case of non-delivery of the ZM, the CLO initiates an enforcement procedure.
This includes the following steps: - first reminder - second reminder, with the threat of a penalty payment and - setting the penalty payment.
Although the German tax code allows the imposition of a penalty payment of up to 25,000 Euro (§ 329 AO), the CLO imposes three penalty payments of 125, 250 and 500 Euro.
In addition, § 26a (1) No. 5 UStG states that the taxable person acts in a disorderly manner if, intentionally or frivolously, he does not give a ZM properly, completely or in a timely manner or if he does not correct a ZM or does not correct it in a timely manner.
This breach can be punishable by a fine of up to Euro5,000.
Data on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered by the FÄ into the VIES, because only the CLO is responsible for the processing of the ZM.
The data of the ZM is only stored at the CLO.
The information from the summary reports is only available to the FÄ after their processing by the CLO.
The deadlines for processing ZM are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
The data of the ZM must be stored within three months of the calendar quarter in question (in VIES).
In the case of incorrect VAT ID number in the ZM of German taxpayers, the German CLO receives a notification "O_MCTL" from the other Member State.
The CLO then turns to the entrepreneur and asks for the right data.
If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case will be submitted to the relevant FA.
It is then up to them to request the correct information.
In the course of its audit, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs corrected the USt IdNr. At the request of the CLO.
However, remembering, threatening and fixing up to three successive penalty payments takes too much time when a taxpayer may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.
The cases, which were ultimately reported to the competent authorities, were usually closed within one to two months.
The relevant FA denied tax exemption for reported intra-Community supplies in 73% of these cases9.
If the taxpayer presented the correct VAT ID number, the FA asked him to hand over a corrected VAT number to the CLO, because the FÄ cannot correct the VIES data itself.
The BRH found that neither the FÄ nor the CLO controlled the surrender of the corrected ZM.
As the CLO does not have access to the data of the VAT returns, there is no comparison of the information given in the VAT pre-notifications or the VAT declaration on goods deliveries with the corresponding information in the ZM before these data are forwarded to the CLO of the other Member States.
This comparison can only be made by the FÄ, which is usually done during the preparation of a special VAT check.
Data received from other Member States will be processed by CLO.
Incorrect VAT ID numbers are detected and reported to the Member States concerned.
The data will be used for the control of employment taxation in the Federal Republic of Germany.
As soon as they are available in the system, it compares the CLO with the data of previous calendar quarters.
If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control notifications will be issued and sent to the competent authority.
This is done on an ongoing basis, whereas a list of the acquisition data of all tax payers will be drawn up later and forwarded to the tax office.
The risk management system (RMS) for the predisposition procedure then compares this data with those for intra-Community acquisitions.
The system checks in full (only) those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct the pre-tax.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries to a person registered for VAT in another Member State must surrender a ZM to the local FA within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter.
The FÄ process the ZM and forward the data to the CLO.
The values of intra-Community supplies reported by the taxable persons in the Central Tax Office will be compared with the values of intra-Community supplies indicated by the same taxable persons in their VAT returns.
The results of the settlement will be taken into account in the tax assessment.
In Germany, taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries are obliged to pay quarterly VAT within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter10.
Since 1 January 2007, taxable persons have had to submit the ZM electronically to the CLO.
The data from the ZM are only available to the FÄ after their processing at the CLO.
In both the Czech Republic and Germany, the taxable persons in the ZM only declare the deliveries of goods.
The provision of services is not specified in the ZM. Unlike the Czech FÄ, the German FÄ cannot correct erroneous information in individual lines of the submitted ZM itself.
Due to this limited access to the German MIAS data, incorrect VAT ID numbers were not corrected even if the taxable person reported the correct VAT ID number to the FA.
The German tax administration does not compare the information on intra-Community deliveries made by German taxpayers in their VAT registrations with the information provided by the relevant ZM.
Differences between the data of the pre-notification and the ZM are regularly not revealed before the German CLO forwards the VIES data to other Member States.
On the basis of these findings by the BRH, it is obvious that a comparison would improve the reliability of the transmitted VIES data.
The data provided by other Member States on the supply of goods to Czech taxpayers will be compared in the Czech Republic with the data on purchases of goods indicated by Czech taxpayers in their VAT returns.
The Czech CLO makes the comparison for each calendar quarter separately.
The most serious cases of deviations are sent to the FÄ for examination.
Unlike the Czech tax administration, the German tax administration does not generally examine the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.
Such general control will only be carried out on taxable persons who are not fully entitled to deduct VAT.
In addition, the German tax administration only controls the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other taxable persons if the RMS produces an audit report or if the taxable person has already been selected for an audit.
This procedure relieves the FÄ from clarifying the reasons for any differences.
On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
In order to combat carousel fraud, updated information on intra-Community acquisitions must be available as early as possible.
The current system of the ZM, in particular VIES, provides financial authorities with information that may well be half a year old.
This time delay could be reduced to up to four months if taxpayers had to surrender monthly ZMs.
The monthly levy would only increase the administrative burden insignificantly, since most taxpayers in the Czech Republic and Germany are already obliged to file monthly VAT returns or pre-notifications and for which ZM no more information is required than for VAT returns or pre-notifications.
In order to avoid bureaucracy, the levying of the ZM could be linked to the filing of VAT returns or pre-notifications.
However, an obligation to provide ZM on a monthly basis would cause more periodic discrepancies between the information on intra-Community supplies and those on intra-Community purchases and increase the flow of data between CLOs.
In 2006, the Federal Government considered the general introduction of monthly ZMs.
The implementation failed due to the concerns of the federal states.
They feared that a monthly transmission of VIES data to the CLO of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In order for the obligation to provide ZM on a monthly basis to be effective, it is necessary to agree on the uniform monthly fee at European level, so that a monthly update of the VIES data is possible.
Statistical information on goods deliveries and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany
In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.
The total turnover of intra-Community trade between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Table 2.
Both auditors requested data on the number of false tax numbers or VAT ID numbers in the O_MCTL reports, which were exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for each of the audited quarters.
These data can be found in the tables below.
They have significant differences.
The reason for the differences can be a different calculation basis for the number of O_MCTL messages.
While the Czech CLO refers the numbers to the calendar quarter for which the ZM was issued, the German CLO refers its numbers to the calendar quarter in which O_MCTL was received.
International exchange of information at level 3
Implementation of the international exchange of information in the Czech Republic
The international exchange of information allows tax officials to obtain information from other Member States on intra-Community transactions and on the taxable persons who have exported them.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on mutual assistance in the field of VAT, which repealed Directive (EEC) No 218/92 (hereinafter "Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003"), distinguishes between two basic types of exchange of information: exchange of information on request and spontaneous exchange of information (without prior request).
The international exchange of information on request is carried out by means of a request for information (RFI) using the standardised SCAC form.
Financial officials in the Czech Republic send their RFIs or their responses to a received RFI through the Financial Directorate to the CLO, which translates the information provided in the standardised SCAC form into the foreign language and forwards it to the other Member States.
In addition, the CLO receives requests for information (RFI) from other Member States and the responses to requests sent. It provides for their translation into the Czech Republic and their distribution to the competent authorities for processing.
Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 sets a maximum period of three months from receipt of the request for its processing.
All RFIs exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany during the audited period were audited by NKÚ.
Out of the total number of 94 RFIs received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were dealt with within the three-month period; in a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) this processing period was exceeded.
In the remaining one case, no answer had been sent to Germany until the examination by the NKÚ. More detailed information on the deadlines within which the Czech Republic responded to the requests made by Germany can be found in Figure 2.
Out of the total number of 335 requests for information (RFIs) sent to Germany from the Czech Republic, a response was received in 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) within the three-month period; a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were processed after the expiry of this period, and in 19 cases no response was received from Germany at the time of the examination by the NKÚ (in the remaining one case could not be determined on the basis of the declared information). When Germany answered the request for information).
More detailed information on the deadlines within which the requests for information from the Czech Republic from Germany were answered can be found in Figure 3.
The percentages of intra-Community transactions indicated in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Figure 4.
The graph above shows that the sales audited in connection with requests for information were mostly worth more than Euro60,000.
The international exchange of information without prior request is either automatic, structured automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.
The tax officials of other Member States are often provided with information without prior request, which is important for determining the value added tax liability.
In the Czech Republic, all information is collected at the CLO.
The exchange of information between the individual Member States takes place electronically.
"Automatic exchange" under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 means the systematic transmission of previously defined information to other Member States at regular, pre-determined intervals, without prior request.
"structured automatic exchange" means the systematic transmission of previously defined information to another Member State, without its prior request, as soon as the relevant information is available.
The Czech Republic informs the other Member States of the automatic exchange of information on deliveries of new vehicles.
The financial officer obtains this information from the pre-printed notification of the delivery of a new vehicle pursuant to Section 19 of Law No. 235/2004, as well as from the copy of the invoice issued.
When processing this form, the financial officer enters the required data into the corresponding document template and forwards it directly to the responsible employee of the financial directorate, where the data is collected and sent to the CLO for further processing, after which the data will be transmitted to the other Member States within the specified period, at the latest within two months of the end of the quarter in which they were obtained.
The Czech Republic also provides other Member States with information on mail order transactions that are tax-free in the country of origin, on intra-Community transactions that appear to be inadmissible and on potential "missing traders."
This information is transmitted to the other Member States by means of a SCAC form of spontaneous exchange of information.
Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany
In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information originates from the local FA.
The FÄ send the completed form SCAC 2004 by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which forwards the SCAC forms to the foreign CLO.
The FÄ are instructed to write their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the SCAC form used is one-size-fits-all.
Half of the German requests for information examined by the BRH were sent in order to ensure the taxation of employment in the other Member State or to prove the tax exemption of intra-Community supplies from Germany to the other Member State.
If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it checks whether the value of the deliveries specified in the request exceeds the minimum amount of Euro15,000.
If there is no reasonable justification for the request, the German CLO refuses to provide information regarding a turnover below the minimum amount limit.
In addition, the German CLO is concerned with the translation of freely formulated texts in the SCAC form [ (B1-17) or (E) ], if they are not written in German or English.
In order to answer the request for information, the CLO directs it to the responsible FA and refers to the three-month period.
No further deadlines have been set at the various levels of German financial management.
Although the German CLO has the technical means to monitor compliance with the deadline, it does not have the necessary personnel capacity to remind the FÄ of answering the unfinished requests for information.
The FÄ will receive the required information by writing to the taxpayer or conducting an external audit.
The external auditors usually choose between two types of audit: the special sales tax audit, which covers all taxable transactions within a period of several months, or the so-called sales tax review, which may only refer to a recent transaction.
This short and flexible form of examination does not require an announcement to the taxpayer and has proved its worth in the examination of a single turnover.
In the case of the automatic exchange of information, Germany provides the other Member State with the following information: - via USt-IdNr., which has been allocated to companies established in other EC Member States - on the refund of VAT to entrepreneurs established in other EC Member States.
In addition, Germany has undertaken to provide the following information to the other EC Member States in the framework of the structured automatic exchange of information:
A. The supply of new vehicles to traders without UStIdNr., b. distance selling (shipping) to other EC Member States not subject to VAT in Germany, c. Significant discrepancies between the purchases reported by a taxable person and the MIAS data transmitted by other Member States, i.e. intra-Community supplies of goods subject to taxation by the taxable person in Germany, e. potential "Missing Traders" which have made intra-Community transactions, regardless of whether their VAT number is still valid or has already been deleted, as well as for taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries to potential "missing traders" or to customers who have misused a VAT ID number.
Comparison and evaluation
The sending of requests for information or spontaneous information takes place both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the initiative of the local authorities, who send the corresponding SCAC forms to the CLO.
While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCAC forms (Czech-English) and translates information provided into English or German, the German FÄ follow the instruction to write requests for information or spontaneous information in a monolingual form only in German.
The German CLO does not produce translations of German texts.
When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany in the period 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005, the NKÚ found that the Czech financial administration handled 74.5% of the requests for information received within the three-month period, while the requests for information sent to Germany were only dealt with by the German financial administration in 40.6% of the cases within that period.
Although the German CLO refers the FÄ to the three-month period, it does not monitor its compliance.
Due to the absence of memories, there is a high proportion of time-limited requests for information.
That is why the BRH has recommended a continuous reminder procedure to the German CLO.
The situation has now changed.
According to the information available to us, the German CLO is now reminding the tax authorities to respond to the outstanding requests for information.
VAT risk management
Risk management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several organizational units at different levels of financial management are involved in risk management in the area of sales tax.
Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organizational units are responsible for risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:
The department of methodology and economic management of sales tax, or its risk management unit, deals with the identification of potential risk areas for tax revenue and evaluates the trends in these risks in domestic and intra-Community trade.
At the national level, this body coordinates the requirements for the "credibility of VAT returns" criterion and uses the VIES data to detect possible tax evasions in the context of intra-Community deliveries and purchases.
Based on data on the Czech Republic's trade balance, it evaluates risk-prone goods, prepares conceptual risk management in the area of sales tax and cooperates in this area with the relevant EC institutions and the other Member States.
The Department for International Administrative Assistance in the field of VAT provides inter alia for the exchange of information, participates in the creation and maintenance of a relevant information database, evaluates the data of other Member States available in the VIES system, carries out public relations work and is responsible for other forms of intergovernmental assistance within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003.

The Tax Examination and Tax Investigation Department conducts, among other things, risk analyses in the context of the methodical control of tax audits, sets priorities for the work planning of the financial directorates with regard to the selection of cases to be examined, prepares risk analyses to combat tax evasion and, in this context, collects information from financial management and other sources and makes proposals for measures to combat tax evasion.
Tax investigation bodies exist in the financial directorates. Their tasks include the search for taxpayers and sectors that are risky in terms of the frequency of tax evasion (e.g., Internet transactions, gold, pharmaceutical industry), the search for unregistered taxpayers (e.g., in the sectors of Internet services, employment services, electronic and print media, etc.), the investigation of links in chain fraud cases and the information of the local financial authorities.
Special testing units have been set up in 12 selected cases.
They have a regional competence and, on the basis of appropriate authorisation, carry out tax audits outside the local area of competence of the FÄ.
The need to set up the special audit units arose from the increase in identified new and "improved" forms of tax evasion, especially in the context of chain transactions.
These special units check according to the needs of the tax investigators or concentrate on taxable persons with certain activities, multinational companies and taxable persons with particularly high turnovers.
The following mechanisms for reducing the risks in the area of VAT have been integrated into the ATIS system: - the task of "credibility of VAT returns" to assess the risk of tax returns, - the task of "selecting the taxable persons to be audited," selecting the taxable persons to be audited on the basis of certain criteria - the task of "MIAS" which allows tax officials access to the data provided by the other EC Member States.
The task of "MIAS" allows, among other things: - verification of the validity of the VAT ID of taxable persons from other Member States, - confirmation of the value of the goods delivered to a Czech taxable person, as indicated in the ZM by all suppliers of the taxable person from other Member States, - creation of a list of taxable persons who have not surrendered a ZM, - formal control of the information provided by taxable persons in the Czech Republic in their ZM. before this information is sent to other Member States - drawing up a list of taxable persons in whose VAT returns the information on goods delivered to other Member States does not match the information in the CMD - drawing up a list of taxable persons in whose VAT returns the information on the value of goods purchased from other Member States does not match the information in the CMD of all their suppliers from other Member States13.
As part of their mission to combat tax evasion, tax officials have access to data from public authorities such as commercial registers, land registers, motor vehicle registers, business registers, etc.
More detailed information can be found in Section 4.4.1 Dispensing and processing of summary notifications in the Czech Republic.
Risk management in Germany
Due to their federal structure, both the federal financial authorities (in particular the CLO) and the financial authorities of the 16 federal states are involved in the development and implementation of a RMS in the Federal Republic of Germany.
It is true that there are joint working groups for development, but neither the CLO nor the financial authorities of the federal states have a complete uniform database.
At the level of the CLO, the unit ST I 2 (hereafter "KUSS" - Coordinating Unit for special sales tax audits and tax investigation measures) collects the audit findings on fraud in the OPUS database.
In cooperation with the countries, another database called ZAUBER has been set up at KUSS, where the tax authorities can enter and query the names of discovered Missing Traders or VAT fraudsters.
The KUSS coordinates both related cases of VAT fraud at national level and cases of cross-border VAT fraud.
The experiences of the KUSS are brought into the development of the RMS through their cooperation in the working groups.
In addition, experts from several other organizational units of the CLO and the BMF are also involved.
The formal review of the composition of UStIdNr. Of other Member States, which appear in the ZM of German taxpayers, will be carried out at the CLO.
This formal review takes place before the transmission of the ZM to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of the VIES data and thus its usefulness (see 4.4.2).
The validity check in the USt-IdNr., referred to in the ZM, is carried out on the basis of the O_MCTL identifiers sent by the other Member States (for the procedure for the correction of invalid USt-IdNr., see also 4.4.2).
In addition, the CLO's RMS is based on the VIES data transmitted by the other Member States and generates various types of notifications for the discovery of suspected Missing Traders, using certain characteristics that usually occur in carousel transactions.
The FÄ of the federal states are instructed to process these communications and have to forward the results of their investigations to the CLO in certain cases.
The audit by the BRH has confirmed that all available features must be included in order to conclude with sufficient probability a case of tax fraud (instead of focusing mainly on the turnover of a company).
Accordingly, the BRH has recommended to the BMF to work with combinations of different clues in the preparation of communications.
The risk management system should also take into account other factors, such as the payment behaviour of the taxpayer, the industry or the company's shareholdings.
A second level of risk management exists in the financial administrations of the federal states and focuses on the processing of VAT pre-registrations and annual declarations.
For example, the system draws up a list of those taxable persons who have indicated intra-Community supplies in their VAT pre-notification or annual declaration.
This list is sent to the CLO for the purpose of monitoring the complete surrender of the ZM.
Furthermore, in this type of risk management, the purchases indicated by the taxable person in his annual VAT return are compared with the data in the VIES.
The financial authorities of the federal states avoid a comparison of the quarterly data, as this would result in too many discrepancies, which are due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud; e.g.:
- Suppliers and purchasers assume different timings for the execution of intra-Community sales;
- Different accounting records and tax declarations of Skonti and rebates.
In addition to comparing the information from the VAT returns with the VIES data, many federal states have certain risk management mechanisms, which are based on information in the VAT returns and certain other indications (e.g., company name, age of the owner/participant, number of employees and mode of payment of the taxpayer).
Bavaria has introduced a rules-based risk management system that allows a team of specialists in the fight against tax fraud (hereinafter referred to as "risk managers") to program their own rules in such a way that suspected tax fraudsters are filtered out.
This system is used in the processing of VAT pre-registrations by the FÄ.
This will give the responsible FA the advice of the RMS before the sales tax is set.
Since this system is not capable of learning, the risk managers have to adapt the rules according to the feedback from the fae.
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has developed an adaptive neural network based on the data of detected evasion cases.
Based on this data, the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.
The system draws up a monthly list of tax cases where there is evidence of tax evasion.
On the basis of this list, the competent authorities decide on the examination of the taxable persons concerned.
After the audit, the tax auditors must report their findings so that the RMS can learn from the results of the audits it has proposed.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rules-based fuzzy system.
Based on a lot of data from processed VAT returns and some other evidence, this Neuro-Fuzzy system (also known as the data-mining system) calculates how likely it is that a taxpayer is entangled in tax fraud.
It then compiles a monthly list of suspected tax fraudsters.
On the basis of this list, the FÄ selects the taxable persons concerned for examination and reports the audit results to the data centre in question.
The introduction of these three RMSs is underway in the federal states.
Since each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three anti-fraud systems appears fit for purpose.
It remains to be seen whether the hoped-for effects will materialise in actual use.
Comparison and evaluation
Although it is not possible in this report to deal with the specific criteria of the RMS in the Czech Republic and Germany, the NKÚ and the BRH have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.
Like the different approaches in the three German federal states mentioned above, the RMS of each European state has its particular strengths and weaknesses.
There is currently an exchange of experience between the financial authorities of the European Member States on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.
VAT fraud - in particular carousel fraud - has proved to be not a national problem, but an European one.
The people involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one, but in several Member States.
A Member State alone cannot develop an effective RMS.
Successful criteria, components or approaches for a RMS need to be exchanged and implemented in each EC Member State. If this is not the case, fraudsters will seek out the Member State with the weakest RMS for their crimes.
The tax losses caused by Europe-wide VAT fraud do not necessarily affect the Member State in which the initiator is located.
Any other Member State involved in the fraud may be affected.
That is why there should be an European exchange of experience on the RMS.
Selected results from the examination of individual sales As part of the parallel examinations, the NKÚ and the BRH examined the quality and usability of information on selected deliveries or services.
Which were the subject of the international exchange of information between the financial authorities of the Czech Republic and Germany.
In addition, the two courts jointly examined the handling of several deliveries, which were in doubt about their implementation, or which the taxpayers of both states stated differently in the tax returns or ZM.
At the request of the BRH, NKÚ examined a total of eight business transactions between eight Czech and eight German taxpayers.
In addition, in 43 cases, on the basis of communications from the BRH, NKÚ examined the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany indicated by Czech taxpayers in their tax returns and ZM.
At the request of the NKÚ, the BRH reviewed a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech taxpayers.
The relevant information was exchanged exclusively on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 on CLO.
The examination of the selected cases showed, among other things, that the different procedures for registration in the EC Member States lead to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:
1.
According to the VIES data, a Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth Euro60,500 from a German taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004.
When the Czech taxpayer declared an acquisition of only Euro29,869, the Czech tax administration sent a request for information to Germany for the purpose of verifying the value of the goods delivered.
The German side stated in its reply to the Czech request for information that the German taxpayer in question had delivered goods worth Euro27,381 to his Czech business partner in the second quarter of 2004, Euro31,997 in the third quarter and Euro10,276 in the fourth quarter.
It also emerged from the reply that the VAT ID of the German taxpayer was not valid until 28 September 2004. However, the German CLO had accepted another application from the German taxpayer and brought forward the validity of the VAT ID number retroactively to 1 May 2004.
The German taxpayer corrected the ZM.
On the basis of this information, it was a (inter-Community) acquisition of goods by the Czech taxpayer.
Through a request to the competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that in 2004 the Czech taxpayer had issued additional VAT returns for the individual (under-year) tax periods in which he declared a higher value of purchases from other Member States and at the same time sought the deduction of pre-tax from purchases from other Member States.
On the basis of these additional VAT returns, the competent clerk of the Czech tax office could not clearly determine whether the declared purchases also included the value of the deliveries of the above-mentioned German supplier.
In response to a request for information from the NKÚ, the BRH found that the German supplier had been registered as subject to VAT in September 2003.
Je-doch had not applied for the allocation of an USt-IdNr., but only a tax number applicable to Germany at the time of registration.
Although it is generally not possible in Germany to retroactively assign a VAT ID number to a taxable person, in 2006 the competent clerk of the German financial administration did so retroactively as of 1 May 2004.
The German CLO retroactively allocates an USt-IdNr. If the German entrepreneur did not cause the delayed allocation; e.g., if the CLO caused the delay after the taxpayer's request for the grant of an USt-IdNr.
In this case, the CLO grants the USt-IdNr. Retroactively, because the entrepreneur does not need a valid USt-IdNr. For an intra-Community delivery according to § 6 UStG.
Conversely, a German acquirer does not need the (valid) VAT ID of its supplier to declare the intra-Community acquisition.
Because of these procedural differences between the Member States, the German CLO granted USt-IdNr. Retroactively in this particular case.
2.
As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech tax official asked for a review of the German businessman's registration tax.
According to the VIES data, the date of registration is 5 March 2005, while a registration certificate issued by the local German FA indicates 1 October 2004.
In their reply, the German authorities announced that the German taxpayer had been registered on 1 October 2004, but had not been allocated a VAT ID number in Germany until 16 February 2005 for organisational reasons.
By request from the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ learned that the tax official had carried out a VAT check on the Czech taxable person for the tax periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.
During this examination, the tax office found that the Czech taxpayer had declared in his VAT return services worth CZK 9,897 that he had provided to the German taxpayer prior to his registration (i.e. Before 1 October 2004).
The (Czech) tax office imposed a tax liability of CZK 1,880 on the Czech taxpayer for the third quarter of 2004.
On the basis of the NKÚ's request, the BRH found that the German taxpayer had not been allocated the VAT ID number until he registered his company, which was founded in 2004, with the FA on 16 February 2005.
In addition, the FA registered it retroactively from 1 October 200415 for the purposes of sales tax, in order to be able to monitor the filing of the sales tax declaration for 2004.
In this VAT return, the taxable person declared intra-Community acquisitions from the Czech Republic worth 160 Euro (about 5,000 CZK).
3. In its VAT declaration for September 2004 as well as in its ZM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech taxable person reported goods deliveries worth CZK 114,615 to a German taxpayer.
When reviewing the registration of the German taxpayer in the VIES system, the Czech tax official stated that this registration was only valid from 11 November 2004 and thus after the delivery of goods to Germany.
The Czech tax payer issued a supplementary VAT declaration stating sales from domestic deliveries worth CZK 114,615 and sales tax of CZK 21,777, which he paid.
Through a request to the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer subsequently submitted a request for the resumption of the tax procedure in respect of the supplementary VAT return. As evidence, he submitted a confirmation from the German tax administration that the German taxpayer had been registered since January 1, 2000.
Accordingly, the Czech tax official reviewed the validity of the registration of the German taxpayer in the context of the international exchange of information.
According to the German information, the German taxpayer was not allocated a VAT ID number until 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.
As a result, the Czech tax official dismissed the request to resume the tax procedure.
The BRH found that there had been no intra-Community acquisition of goods in this case because the German taxpayer had only received a VAT ID number on 11 November 2004.
The German recipient, however, declared both the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and the value-added tax, and also demanded the reimbursement of pre-taxes at the same rate.
Because this did not lead to a change in the amount of the tax liability of the German taxpayer, the German tax official did not correct the information in the VAT declaration.
The BRH also found that the company of the German taxpayer named in the request for information was changed during the processing of the reply in Germany, which led to confusion between two German taxpayers.
This change in the name of the German taxpayer also confused the Czech tax official.
4.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax official reviewed the purchase of goods in the first quarter of 2005 by a Czech taxpayer from a German taxpayer worth Euro22,686.
Through a request to the local tax official in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax official had examined in the course of an external examination with the Czech taxpayer whether the intra-EU supply had actually taken place and whether the Czech taxpayer had recorded and paid the invoice for the delivery of the goods.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare the intra-EU purchase in his VAT return because the German supplier did not indicate his VAT ID number in the invoice, but only his tax number for transactions within Germany.
According to the VIES data, the German taxpayer is not registered for VAT in connection with intra-Community transactions until 21 April 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech taxpayer.
The Czech tax official also requested that the German tax administration send a copy of the registration certificate of the German tax payer, so that he could initiate a corresponding tax procedure if necessary.
The Czech FA considered this business to be the purchase of goods from a non-business (private) person in Germany and therefore did not set a sales tax for the purchase of goods from Germany.
The BRH found that under German law, a taxable person who supplies goods to other Member States does not have to have a VAT ID number for intra-Community supplies in order to benefit from the VAT exemption for such a delivery.
The supplier must only have the UStIdNr. Of the buyer in the other Member State and be able to prove the transport of the goods in question to the other Member State.
In this case, the turnover under German tax law is a (tax-exempt) intra-Community supply, which should be subject to employment taxation in the Czech Republic.
In any case, it is important that the Czech finance officer took note of this business incident, because the delivery of a machine of this value was not part of the core business of the German supplier.
As described in Section 4.6.2, the German CLO rejects requests for information on intra-Community transactions if they are below the minimum threshold of Euro15,000:5.
According to the VIES data, in the third quarter of 2004, a Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth Euro12,561 from a German taxpayer.
The Czech tax official carried out an audit for this tax period.
In the framework of the intergovernmental assistance, the Czech financial administration requested the examination of this delivery of goods by means of a SCAC form.
The Czech taxpayer said that he had not received the goods, had never been in business with the German company and that the purchase of the goods in question had not been recorded with him.
The German financial administration rejected the request for the transfer of documents - contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents - because the turnover was less than Euro15,000 and no other justification had been given.
Since the Czech tax official did not receive documentation for the ex-post taxation of the purchased goods, the tax assessment was inconclusive, and the original tax assessment was maintained.
Following a request from the NKÚ, the BRH found that the German taxpayer acted as a "fiscal representative 17" (§ 22 (a) - (e) UStG).
The German taxpayer declared these deliveries in his VAT declaration and in the ZM.
His right to tax exemption has been recognised.
On the basis of the notification by the BRH, the German FA will send the documents required for the ex-post taxation of the purchased goods to the Czech Republic.
In Section 4.6.1, it was shown that the answers given by the German tax administration to requests for information exceeded the three-month period more frequently than the answers given by the Czech tax administration:
6. During its examination, the NKÚ found that on 5 October 2005 the Czech financial administration sent a request for information on the value of deliveries of goods to Germany in the 4th quarter of 2004.
In the ZM for this quarter, the German taxpayer had reported a delivery of goods to the Czech taxpayer worth Euro86,307; however, the Czech taxpayer declared only the purchase of goods worth Euro35,314 for the same period in his VAT return.
In the reply to the request for information submitted to the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after the expiry of the maximum processing period specified in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German side stated that the request for information could not be processed since the German company had been dissolved at the end of 2005.
Because the German tax administration did not meet the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the documents necessary for taxation in the Czech Republic.
7. In 2005, a Czech tax official, using a SCAC form, asked for a review of the delivery of motor vehicles to a German taxpayer in the third and fourth quarters of 2004, worth Euro1,265,554, with evidence of carousel fraud.
The NKÚ found that at the time of its examination, a German response to the request for information had not yet been received.
Through a request to the local tax official, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer had not declared in his VAT return the delivery of new vehicles to this German taxpayer worth CZK 11,816,103.
The Czech tax official corrected the information in the tax return and the Czech tax payer issued a corrected tax.
Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not forward this request for information to the local FA for examination.
Following the notification by the BRH, a special VAT check was carried out on the German buyer in Germany, where it was established that the purchase of all the cars in question had been correctly taxed, and that the vehicles were sold to other taxable persons in Germany.
8. According to the VIES data, in the fourth quarter of 2004, the Czech taxpayer purchased a car worth Euro48,500 from a German taxpayer.
However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.
By asking the local tax official in the Czech Republic, NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer had not filed a VAT return since August 2004.
The Czech taxpayer did not file any tax returns even after the request of the tax official. Consequently, on 23 May 2005, the FA set the VAT liability for the period October to December 2004 at zero.
On 2 June 2005, the CLO issued an instruction to examine the said delivery from the German taxpayer.
As the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the tax official, he sent a request for information on the above-mentioned delivery to Germany.
Since the answer to the request for information was only received on 7 February 2007, it was not known until the conclusion of the examination of the NKÚ how the Czech tax official used the information obtained in the international exchange of information.
Due to non-compliance with the obligations under the Czech VAT Act, the VAT registration of the Czech taxable person was deleted with effect from 23 August 2005.
In some cases, only a partial reply was sent because, at the time of the examination of the NKÚ and the BRH, the competent FA had not yet completed the external examination:
9.
In 2005, by means of a SCAC form, the Czech tax official asked for a review of the delivery of motor vehicles to a German taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004, with evidence of carousel fraud.
In his reply to the request for information, the German tax official stated that he only had the invoices issued by the Czech taxpayer for supplies worth Euro16,335.
On the basis of the NKÚ's request, the BRH found that the external audit carried out by the German FA had not yet been completed by the acquirer in Germany.
The German purchaser declared the purchase of goods worth Euro16,335 twice in its preliminary VAT registrations for the months of August and September 2004.
10. In 2005, a Czech tax official, using a SCAC form, asked for a review of deliveries of motor vehicles to a German taxpayer worth Euro198,167 in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, with signs of carousel fraud.
The German tax administration sent a partial response to the request for information to the Czech Republic, in which it confirmed that the German taxpayer had purchased several vehicles, and that the investigation in Germany had not yet been completed.
The NKÚ found that the local FA had carried out several external audits on the Czech taxpayer in order to verify the deduction of higher than average input taxes.
However, an unwarranted claim has not been established.
The BRH found that, for the period in question, the German taxpayer had declared in his VAT returns the purchase of goods from other Member States with a total value of Euro579.114, and that the examination of the German FA by the acquirer in Germany has not yet been completed.
Section 4.4.1 describes the reasons for disagreements between the declaration of intra-Community acquisitions in the recipient's VAT return and the information in the supplier's VAT return.
In the cases examined, it emerged that periodic discrepancies18 or the incorrect declaration of a turnover as an intra-Community supply of goods were not the most common reasons for the differences:
11.
According to data from VIES, in the first quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth Euro35,716 from the German taxpayer, but the Czech taxpayer did not declare the acquisition.
Since the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the tax official and did not do business at the company's legal headquarters, the Czech tax official asked for a review of how the German taxpayer had communicated with the Czech within the framework of the international exchange of information.
The German response to the request for information revealed that, according to the findings of the German financial management, the Czech taxpayer was unknown at the specified address and the goods were picked up by an agreed freight forwarder.
The total value of the order was Euro155,000, but the German taxpayer only delivered goods worth Euro21,659.
The Czech taxpayer sent the German taxpayer a false confirmation of payment of Euro155,153 in favour of the German taxpayer.
After the discovery of the fraudulent behaviour of the Czech buyer, the German taxpayer, with the support of his other Czech clients, managed to recover the supplied material with the exception of a part worth Euro7,916.
Through a request to the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that, on the basis of the information received, the tax administration subsequently imposed on the Czech taxpayer, among other things, a tax on sales of goods from other Member States, amounting to CZK 388,522.
Following a request from the NKÚ, the BRH confirmed that, after corrections, the German supplier had only reported a consignment of goods to the Czech taxpayer worth Euro7,916.
In accordance with German legislation, the German taxpayer declared the cancellation of the delivery and the reduction of the tax base in the quarter of the cancellation.
His ZM included the following information concerning Czech taxpayers:
12.
In the context of the international exchange of information, the German financial management asked for a review of the delivery of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005 by means of a SCAC form.
According to the request for information, during the period in question, the Czech taxpayer had supplied goods to the German taxpayer with a total value of Euro396.126 and provided services worth Euro11,885.
The NKÚ found that the Czech tax administration had carried out an audit on the Czech taxpayer in order to investigate this delivery.
In response to the request for information, the Czech tax administration announced that the Czech taxpayer had supplied and installed a production plant for the German one.
The Czech taxpayer supplied the individual parts of the production plant prior to the Czech Republic's accession to the EC and the production plant was assembled on the basis of the order after 1 May 2004.
The German taxpayer did not take down the assembled production plant and claimed faults.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer charged the German production plant for Euro107,100 and Euro11,885 for services.
The German taxpayer received the bills, but did not recognise them and did not pay them.
By asking the local tax official in the Czech Republic, NKÚ found that all invoices on the books of the Czech taxpayer had been properly accounted for.
The VAT returns for the third quarter of 2005 included only the amounts documented by the Czech taxpayer relating to invoices invoiced after the first of May 2004.
The BRH found that, on the basis of the Czech financial management's reply, the local FA concluded that these transactions were a single (goods) delivery of the Czech taxpayer to the German assembly, including the assembly performed.
In this particular case, the place of performance of this so-called factory delivery is the place where the production plant is assembled.
The German recipient of the delivery of the work owes the sales tax in accordance with the German sales tax law.
At the same time, the recipient can claim a deduction in the same amount.
As the German taxpayer's liability for turnover remained unchanged, the German FA did not issue a correction to the VAT declaration.
13. According to the VIES data, in February 2005, Czech taxpayer A purchased a machine worth Euro58,000 from the German taxpayer C.
The Czech tax official sent a request for verification of this information to Germany.
In response to the request for information, the German side announced that the German taxpayer C had delivered this machine to the Czech taxpayer B in 2004, but returned it to the German taxpayer C in October 2004.
According to the German tax administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but to the establishment of the German taxpayer C in the Czech Republic.
The reply to the request for information also revealed that the German taxpayer C had delivered the machine to the Czech taxpayer A in February 2005.
He received the machine at the headquarters of the German taxpayer's office in the Czech Republic.
Since this delivery (from C to A) took place only within the Czech Republic, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods.
By asking the local tax official responsible for the taxable person, the NKÚ found that, according to the VIES data, in the third quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer C had supplied the Czech taxpayer with goods (another machine) worth Euro88.027.
Tax payer B said he did not receive the goods, so the local Czech tax official sent a request for information to Germany.
The answer was that the machine had been delivered.
In the course of further investigations with the taxable person B, the tax official stated that the machine, worth Euro88.027, had not been registered with the taxable person B and that it could be the same type of machine as the branch of the German taxpayer C had delivered to the Czech taxpayer A in February 2005.
The NKÚ also found that the local Czech tax official responsible for the taxable person A had carried out an audit on the latter.
The tax official had the invoice of the German taxable person C of 7 February 2005, in which the taxable person A is indicated as the recipient of the machine.
The Czech tax official noted that taxable person A had not recorded this invoice.
Taxable A had signed a lease agreement with another Czech company, the subject of which was a machine of the same type.
The leasing company delivered the machine on February 9, 2005 and also provided transport.
The Czech FA did not use the information provided in the reply to the request for information to determine the tax liability of the taxpayer A.
The BRH found that the German taxpayer C had delivered the machine, worth Euro88.027, not to the Czech Republic, but to another German taxpayer D.
Accordingly, there was no intra-Community supply of goods, but a taxable supply within Germany.
Consequently, the German tax official did not recognise the claim of the German taxpayer C for VAT exemption and corrected the information in his tax return.
The German taxpayer D supplied the machine to the Czech taxpayer B.
According to German law, this delivery was not subject to tax in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.
The BRH also found that the German taxpayer C had indicated in its ZM for the first quarter of 2005 the delivery of a machine worth Euro58,000 to the Czech taxpayer A.
This delivery was not checked during the tax audit carried out by the German FA.
The figure below represents the contractual relationship between the business partners involved in the above-mentioned transactions.
14.
When examining requests for information received, the NKÚ found that on 4 October 2005 the Czech tax administration received a request for information from Germany, in which a German tax official requested the verification of intra-Community supplies of a German taxpayer worth Euro879,680.625 to a Czech taxpayer.
The German tax official said there was a suspicion that this was a fictitious intra-Community delivery of goods.
The German taxpayer has not been active since 1999.
The NKÚ found that the Czech tax official had carried out an external audit on the Czech taxpayer.
The head of the Czech company said that it was probably a claim of the German taxpayer against the German financial management, which the Czech taxpayer had made as a shareholder in the German company to the German FA.
According to the information provided to the NKÚ, the Czech tax official has so far no information that the German tax administration is handling the case with reference to the Czech taxpayer.
According to the information available, it was not a delivery of goods; nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored in the MIAS as an intra-Community delivery of goods from Germany to a Czech taxpayer.
The main reason for these disagreements was the failure to mention the intra-Community acquisition in the tax returns of the recipients (see Section 4.4.1):
15. According to the VIES data, in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005, a German taxpayer supplied goods to a Czech taxpayer with a total value of Euro33,205.
However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare the intra-Community acquisition.
The Czech tax official asked for an examination of the delivery of goods from Germany as part of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In its reply to this request for information, the German side stated that the German taxpayer had sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech taxpayer, and that the other goods had been picked up personally.
Through a request to the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer had submitted an additional VAT return for the period in question before receiving a reply to the request for information.
Nevertheless, the differences regarding the value of the acquisitions could not be clarified, so the Czech tax official recommended a tax check with the Czech taxpayer.
This test has not yet been carried out.
16. According to the VIES data, in the third quarter of 2004, a German taxpayer had delivered goods worth Euro46,854 to a Czech taxpayer.
For the same period, a Czech taxpayer declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only Euro14,856.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech tax official asked for verification of the actual value of the delivery.
With the German reply to this request, three invoices were sent which showed a total value of the goods delivered of Euro31,999, i.e. an amount equal to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech taxpayer and the VIES data.
By asking the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ found that after receiving the reply from Germany, he contacted the accountant of the Czech taxpayer and stayed with her in such a way that, after checking the invoices, she wanted to discuss with the company owner the issue of a supplementary VAT return for the third quarter of 2004.
Until now, no additional VAT declaration has been issued.
The Czech tax official informed the NKÚ that he would proceed in such a way that the deadlines for a retroactive VAT fix for the relevant tax period would be respected.
17.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer delivered goods worth Euro11,600 to the German taxpayer.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the German tax official asked for confirmation as to whether the above-mentioned Czech taxpayers actually existed, since the alleged capital owner of the German taxpayer had set up a number of bogus companies in Germany.
In the course of the FA's review of the transaction, the Czech taxpayer confirmed the purchase of the goods.
According to the Czech taxpayer, however, the goods were not delivered from Germany to the Czech Republic, but were resold in Germany in 2005.
The Czech taxpayer presented evidence of the sale in January 2005.
The Czech taxpayer was not registered as a taxable person in Germany and had not taxed the sale of the goods in question in either the Czech Republic or Germany.
All of these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany, and the Czech tax official provided this information in his response to the request for information to the German tax administration.
Through a request to the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer had issued a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004 on the basis of a tax assessment, in which he declared, among other things, the value of the goods he had purchased from a German taxpayer and at the same time asserted the right of deduction for the purchase from other Member States.
In his Czech VAT declaration, he did not declare a sales tax on the sale of goods in Germany.
On the basis of a supplementary VAT declaration issued after the external audit, the Czech tax official fixed the VAT liability unchanged.
According to Czech legislation, in this case, there was no purchase of goods from other Member States, as the goods were not shipped or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.
Thus, the Czech tax official came to the wrong conclusion during the external audit.
The BRH found that immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information, which revealed that the goods had not left Germany, the German tax official corrected the tax return of the German taxpayer and demanded the payment of sales tax worth Euro1,600.
In addition, the competent FA sent a control notice to the FA, which is responsible for the actual recipient of the goods, to ensure that the resale of those goods is properly taxed.
In the following cases, traders declared intra-Community supplies that may not have been carried out:
18.
The Czech tax official received a request for information from the German tax administration on whether the Czech taxpayer had purchased a car worth Euro47,400 from the German taxpayer in February 2005.
A copy of the VAT registration certificate of the Czech taxpayer was attached to the request for information.
As a further attachment, a photocopy of the passport was attached to the person who was supposed to have transferred the vehicle.
In the course of his investigation, the Czech tax official found that the passport had been stolen, that the person named in it had not imported a vehicle into the Czech Republic and said that he had no contacts with a German taxpayer.
The VAT registration certificate, the imprint of which had been sent by the German side, had not been issued by the Czech tax administration.
With this information, the Czech tax official answered the request for information and at the same time stated that he could not confirm the purchase of the car.
By asking the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ stated that the Czech taxpayer does not have his seat at the address indicated in the commercial register and that the company's managing director cannot be reached.
Following a tax redress procedure for the tax period of February 2005, the Czech tax official set the tax liability of the Czech taxpayer at zero.
In the course of a further investigation, the Czech finance officer found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had purchased it on the basis of an internet advertisement.
The BRH found that the local German tax official had rejected the German taxpayer's claim to exempt this supply from VAT on the basis of the Czech response to the request for information.
19. In the course of an external audit, a German FA was unable to clarify a difference of Euro3,000 between the value of the purchased goods specified in the VAT declaration and the reported values from other Member States.
A Czech taxpayer should have delivered goods worth Euro89,424 to a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.
Since the acquisition declared by the German taxpayer did not comply with the VIES data, the German tax official asked for the verification of deliveries and their payment as part of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In his reply to the request for information, the Czech tax official stated that the sole managing director of the Czech company had been deleted from the commercial register on 8 July 2005 and that a new managing director had not yet been registered.
The German recipient of the goods was presumed to be a relative of the shareholder of the Czech company.
The Czech tax payer issued a VAT declaration and a ZM, which was signed by a person not authorised to do so, namely this shareholder of the company, after the deletion of the managing director in the commercial register.
The accountant of the Czech taxpayer informed the tax official that the owner of the capital had paid the payment received for the goods invoiced in euros into the company's account.
Cash receipts have not been issued.
Through a request to the local Czech FA, the NKÚ found that the tax official recognised the Czech taxpayer's right to VAT exemption for supplies of goods to other Member States worth CZK 1,326,307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 in the first quarter of 2005.
The BRH found that the German tax official did not correct the VAT declaration of the German buyer, since in the meantime a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German taxpayer.
Since the previous external audit showed no signs of tax fraud, there was no prospect of actually being able to collect a fixed value-added tax debt.
20. According to the VIES data, in 2005, a German taxpayer purchased goods from the Czech Republic worth Euro4,251,196, according to which he had purchased goods worth Euro43,274 in the previous year.
The German taxpayer did not declare the intra-Community acquisitions either in his 2004 sales tax declaration or in the one for 2005.
In addition, it did not declare any initial sales in terms of value.
Due to these disagreements, the German FA submitted a request for information concerning the 4th quarter of 2005 and the 1st quarter of 2006.
In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-Community supplies of goods for a total value of CZK 167,246,083.
On 6 September 2006, the request for information was received, in which the German side asked to check whether the delivery reported by the Czech taxpayer had actually taken place.
In response to this request for information, the Czech financial management stated that the German request could not be met because the Czech company did not have a managing director (or other legal representatives).
From the documents provided to NKÚ by the competent tax official, it can be seen that, together with the managing director of the Czech taxpayer, a protocol was drawn up on 30 March 2006 on the start of the audit of turnover for the 4th quarter of 2004 and the period from January to December 2005.
At the same time, the tax payer was asked by the tax official to provide all accounting and tax documents for that period, but failed to do so.
According to the commercial register, the term of office of the sole managing director expired on 16 May 2005 without the appointment of a new managing director.
The Czech taxpayer has not issued any turnover tax returns since April 2006.
In the context of the parallel examination, the NKÚ, in cooperation with the BRH, investigated several cases of intra-Community supplies between the Czech Republic and Germany, which were not the subject of a prior exchange of information between the two countries.
The two courts of auditors exchanged information on the cases examined through the CLO of both countries.
21. A Czech company (UCR), which is not based in Germany, informed the competent FA (Chemnitz-Süd) that it wanted to do taxable business in Germany.
On the basis of this information, the company was registered as of June 2005, but did not receive a German VAT ID number.
The (UCR) accepted an order from a Danish company (UDK) for the production of wind turbines and their delivery to Austria on behalf of, at the risk and for the account of the Danish customer.
Due to insufficient production capacity, the Danish company passed on part of the order to a German taxpayer (UDE) resident in Germany.
The following figure shows the contractual relations and the transport route of the wind turbines:
According to German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:
- The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines to Austria on its behalf, at its risk and for its own account.
Due to the installation, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the delivery of the wind turbines is controllable in Austria.
- Because the freight forwarder was commissioned by the Danish company (UDK) and the latter had the transport carried out in its own name, at its own risk and for its own account, the place of delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE) is where the transport started, i.e. in Germany.
Although the wind turbines were delivered to another EC Member State (AU) and the receiver is registered as taxable in an EC Member State (CR), no tax exemption could be claimed for the delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE), since the EC Member State for which the delivery was intended is different from the State of the Czech company19.
Accordingly, the delivery is properly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the deduction in its VAT returns.
The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) also depends on the place where the transport started.
However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.
- The delivery of wind turbines produced in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
- The delivery of the remaining wind turbines, which were manufactured in Germany, took place in Germany.
Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) provided both intra-Community supplies from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-Community supplies from Germany to Austria.
The BRH found that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare intra-Community supplies either in its German tax returns or in its ZM delivered to the German CLO.
Thus, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-Community supplies uniformly as intra-Community supplies from the Czech Republic.
The NKÚ found that (UCR) did not report intra-Community deliveries to Austria, but intra-Community deliveries to Denmark.
In order to ensure the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria, cooperation would be required from at least four financial administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German), although in this case there is no evidence of tax fraud or evasion.
In addition, the NKÚ and the BRH examined case designs to show the size of the differences between the information in the VAT returns and the VIES data caused by the different legislation in 2004.
The cases examined also show that it will take some time for taxpayers and the tax authorities to apply the new legislation:
22. In its ZM for the second, third and fourth quarter of 2004, a Czech taxpayer reported goods deliveries to a German taxpayer with a total value of CZK 792,977,452.
During the same period, another Czech taxpayer reported intra-Community supplies to another German taxpayer in his ZM for a total value of CZK 18,157,265.
The information provided by the BRH to the NKÚ revealed that both were electricity supplies.
Both Czech taxable persons took into account the above supplies in their domestic accounts in accordance with Czech Law No. 235/2004, applicable in 2004.
In a further examination of these transactions, an audit group of the NKÚ found that in 2004 different legal regulations concerning the supply and purchase of electrical energy between the Czech Republic and Germany applied.
Whereas in the Czech Republic, taxable persons declared the supply of electrical energy as an intra-Community supply of goods in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 235/2004 in force in 2004, according to the German legislation in force in 2004, it was not an intra-Community acquisition of goods, but taxable and taxable transactions in Germany.
The differences in legal regulations were eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Law No. 635/2004, which changed some tax provisions with effect from 1 January 2005.
23. During the examination of intra-Community supplies or acquisitions in cooperation with the BRH, it was further established that a Czech taxable person declared intra-Community supplies for the first and fourth quarters of 2005 to a German taxpayer with a total value of CZK 240,411,163 and another Czech taxpayer declared intra-Community supplies for the same period to another German taxpayer with a value of CZK 263.470.776.
Information provided by the BRH to the NKÚ revealed that in both cases it had been the supply of electrical energy.
In accordance with the provisions of Law No 235/2004, applicable from 1 January 2005, the place of performance for the supply of electrical energy shall be the place where the purchaser has his legal domicile, his place of business or his place of business for which the delivery is made.
For this reason, the Czech taxpayers should not have indicated the electricity supplies in their ZM for 2005.
The fact that both taxable persons treated the supply of electrical energy in their ZM as intra-Community supplies led to a difference in the amount of CZK 503,881.939 in VIES.
Concluding remarks
Through cooperation, the objectives of the BRH and the NKÚ have been achieved.

DFB boss in firing line: Özil-Causa: sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
With serious accusations, Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the authority of interpretation in the long-running dispute topic Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish president heavily criticised the handling of the ex-world champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib mosque in Cologne, the head of the DFB defended the association line.
Early on Sunday morning, Grindel, who was personally attacked by Özil, announced the consequences of the Causa in the ZDF sports studio in Mainz.
"In the future - because we also have many immigrant players in the U-teams - we have to draw very precise conclusions that this kind of thing does not happen again," said the 57-year-old, and wants to win a national player without a migrant background as a further integration officer.

At the same time, he announced his intention to stand in front of players in the future.
That someone says: if I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm a migrant - that's not possible.
"I very much regret that he has such an impression," Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said that.
However, he does not see any basis for Özil's return to the national team.
In addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration officer is to be appointed as a follow-up.
"If someone without a migrant background is clearly involved in society and football and says, "The issue is important, we have to take care of it," that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration has to work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his persona after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he plans to run for office as DFB president again next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," Grindel said.

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve the burden on relatives in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can continue to be taken only with explicit consent, Swisstransplant points out.
 (dpa) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes will then be available from Swisstransplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can continue to be taken - as in Germany - only with explicit consent, Swisstransplant points out.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases will a card be found at the crucial moment with possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the wish of the deceased.
"They then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very stressful," said Immer.
A similar registration system is already in place in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on possible organ donation on the health insurance card, according to Marita Völker-Albert, spokeswoman of the Federal Centre for Health Education.
"There is no register in which people can register their wishes - for or against organ donation," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has called for a new regulation on organ donation.
Under his proposal, everyone would initially be considered an organ donor, unless they or relatives disagree.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.

Farmers will be allowed to start annual kink maintenance on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start the annual knick-care on Monday.
The "green ramparts" that are unique in Germany have been shaping the landscape of the low-forest federal state for around 200 years.
The tree and scrub hedges, up to five metres wide, are "rolls" and, for many animals and plants, the last retreats.
Knicks connect scattered habitats as corridors through which the exchange of organisms can still function, said Ingo Ludwichowski, managing director of the German Nature Conservation Union (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were created on the orders of the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundaries and cattle fences, they also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
His name "Knick" also comes from that time: the dense, intertwined boundaries could develop due to the "knicking" of the branches.
Today, around 45,000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, giving the image of a wooded, diversely structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used as a substitute habitat by around 7,000 animal species.
In one kilometre of knick, up to 1800 different species could live and up to 30 pairs of birds could breed.
However, the knick can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is properly cared for in winter.
Otherwise, it stunts into a light row of trees, which, in addition to biodiversity, also loses the wind protection effect, Ludwichowski said.
Kink care is only allowed to operate outside the breeding season from October to March, according to the Department of Agriculture.

High-quality transport networks are essential for maintaining and raising the standard of living in Europe.
Ensuring fast, safe, reliable and economic passenger and freight transport is an important task for the state.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
It requires a high level of organisational, technical and financial effort.
The establishment and development of a sustainable European transport infrastructure often requires difficult compromises with European and national policy objectives, such as the preservation of the environment.
It is precisely because of the necessary environmental protection measures that the construction of the transport infrastructure is expensive.
When planning and awarding the construction of transport routes, administrations can save considerable financial resources and use them for other useful purposes through careful action and decision-making.
One of the tasks of state audit authorities is to identify defects that prevent an optimum of economy, efficiency and effectiveness in spending on the construction of transport facilities.
The audit authorities should not only draw the attention of the administrations to the shortcomings that have been identified, but also suggest improvements for the benefit of the citizens and for the benefit of Europe.
Summary
In 2005 and 2006, the two Supreme Audit Institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic, the Federal Audit Office (BRH) and the Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad (NKÚ), carried out parallel audits of expenditure on the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway (D8 motorway in the Czech Republic and A17 motorway in the Federal Republic of Germany).
The two highways are connected by a border bridge jointly financed by the two states.
The cooperation with the NKÚ enabled the BRH to carry out an in-depth examination of the cost-effectiveness of the use of funds in the construction of the border bridge.
In the course of the cooperation with the BRH, NKÚ received data from German bridges and tunnels for its own cost comparisons.
In 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany signed a contract for the construction of the border bridge.
According to the planning progress, the completion date was finally set at the end of 2006.
During the award procedure, however, the Road and Motorway Directorate of the Czech Republic (RMD) made mistakes that delayed the procedure and reduced the available construction time.
The contract with the contractor was therefore concluded later than planned.
The contractor secured the accelerated construction of the bridge until the end of 2006.
For this, however, the RMD had to accept significant additional costs.
As part of the joint audit work, the prices of motorway bridges on the D 8 and the A 17 were compared. The benchmark for the price comparison of the bridges was the size of the bridge surface.
A price analysis using statistical methods identified bridges with high costs per square metre.
The analysis showed that the border bridge was the most expensive among the large bridges, with lengths of more than 100 metres.
This was also due to the increase in prices as a result of the delays in the award.
The comparison of the prices of the tunnels showed that the prices of the tunnels in the course of the D 8 are considerably higher than the prices of comparable tunnels in Germany.
In future audits of the cost-effectiveness of transport infrastructure spending, both BRH and NKÚ can rely on a data collection of bridge and tunnel prices.
Both courts of auditors recommend standardizing bridge constructions and performing steel composite and special constructions only where prestressed concrete structures are not fit for purpose.
The course of the examination was characterised by teamwork and an open approach.
During the parallel examination, the examiners from both sides exchanged their expertise and skills.
Introduction
The subject of this report is the parallel examination of expenditure on the construction of the motorway from Dresden to Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).
The focus of the audit was on the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of funds.
The parallel tests were conducted by the BRH in Germany and the NKÚ in the Czech Republic
In 2005 and 2006.
The NKÚ examined the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the expenditure for the cross-border section 0807 of the D8 motorway in the amount of about 20 billion CZK gross (about 690 million Euro).
Of this amount, Euro64 million will come from the EU's Structural Funds (ISPA).
The BRH had already examined the planning and construction of the A17 motorway in the years 2003 to 2005, regardless of the parallel tests with the NKÚ.
Of the financial volume for the construction of all three sections of the A17, of around Euro670 million, Euro277 million will be co-financed by the European Fund (ERDF).
The Prague-Dresden motorway is part of the Pan-European Corridor IV Dresden - Central and South-Eastern Europe - Istanbul.
The D8 runs from Prague via Usti nad Labem to the Czech/German border,
The A 17 from the border to Dresden.
At the time of the test, the cross-border sections of the motorways were under construction.
Both sections were opened to traffic on 21 December 2006.
While the motorway is thus completed on the German side as far as Dresden, the D 8 remains incomplete on the Czech side, as the section 0805 over a length of 16.4 km between Rehlovice and Lovosice is still in the planning phase.
It is planned to cross a protected landscape area in the Bohemian Central Mountains.
According to Czech forecasts from 2001, the traffic volume in 2008 in the cross-border section 0807 of the D 8 motorway will be 22 940 cars per day.
German forecasts estimate the volume of traffic on the A17 at the Czech border in 2010 to be around 25 000 cars per day.
In 2000, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic concluded a contract for the merger of the German A 17 motorway and the Czech D 8 motorway at the common state border by establishing a border bridge.
Since both states are involved in the construction of this bridge, this single construction project was an important aspect of the parallel audits of both courts.
Cooperation between BRH and NKÚ
From mid-2005, the two courts of auditors held joint discussions on cooperation in the examination of the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway.
Both sides had important reasons for this cooperation:
1.
Germany is partly financing the construction of the border bridge.
Planning and construction are the responsibility of the Czech Road Administration.
There was no possibility for the BRH to examine this building project itself.
2.
The NKÚ did not have any comparative data to assess whether the funds were used sparingly in view of the overall construction costs of the bridges and tunnels on the D8.
3.
The NKÚ also had to examine the effectiveness of the expenditure, in order to examine the essential technical parameters of the bridges and tunnels, which should ensure the same quality of use on both sides of the border.
Following preparatory negotiations, the presidents of the two courts of auditors concluded an agreement on the coordination of the examinations of the Prague-Dresden motorway on 4 January 2006.
The auditors of both audit institutions met in the course of 2006 at about six to eight-week intervals.
In doing so, they dealt with current problems and tasks. They developed an uniform methodology for the examination of bridge and tunnel prices, exchanged test results for the construction of the border bridge and produced joint reports.
The ongoing exchange of information was an essential part of the cooperation.
While the BRH focused on the comparison of the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels as well as the procurement procedures, the NKÚ mainly developed the methodology for the analysis of bridge and tunnel prices.
In Germany and the Czech Republic, the legal basis for financial control is different, and so is the way in which the two courts of auditors complete their audits.
For this reason, the two authorities each produced separate national reports on their audit results.
This report takes into account the results of the two parallel tests.
The cooperation will end with the signing of a final communiqué in the first half of 2007.
Construction of the border bridge
In the 2000 treaty, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed to complete the border bridge in 2005 if possible.
She later postponed the date by mutual agreement until the end of 2006.
RMD acted as the contractor for the construction project.
Germany is contributing 42.13% to the construction of bridges.
Initially, the RMD envisaged a prestressed concrete structure for the border bridge.
However, in 1999 RMD agreed with its German partner on the construction of a steel composite structure.
They justified this decision by the possible reduction of the number of pillar pairs from seven to five and the associated environmental benefits for the Talaue.
In addition, a comparative calculation of the RMD had identified the steel composite construction as the more cost-effective solution.
However, this was due to a calculation error.
The calculation was based on a length of the new steel composite construction of only 397 m,
In fact, however, it is 5% longer.
During the award procedure, the RMD made serious errors,
By inadequately preparing the award documents and by imprecisely describing both evaluation criteria and sub-criteria.
These errors led to subjective and ambiguous assessments by the Commission of Valuation and the Director General of the RMD.
An inferior bidder challenged the outcome of the award procedure.
The subsequent investigation by the Czech cartel office delayed the signing of the construction contract for the border bridge.
As a result, the summer construction season following the bid review was lost in 2004 and the total construction time available was reduced.
The contractor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter period of time, leading to a significant price increase.
The measures offered included the double-assembly of the superstructures, the modification of the pillar shape and the construction of an assembly hall.
In addition, the contractor was unable to procure the type of steel originally intended.
The new type of steel - whose higher costs of around Euro4 million were borne by the customer alone - made it possible to shorten the construction time required for corrosion protection and thus the overall construction time.
Compared to the offer price of around Euro18.3 million net, the acceleration measures and additional supplements will significantly increase the overall construction costs of the border bridge.
The reduced construction time alone led to a price increase of about 5.9 million Euro.
Without price guidance, the cost is currently around Euro25.9 million net (as of October 2006).
Comparison of the prices of bridges and tunnels
Both courts examined the bridge prices on the D 8 and the A 17 in order to identify the bridges, which were characterised by particularly high prices and to compare the bridge prices on the German and Czech sides.
The investigation was based on mathematical statistical methods.
The tunnels on the D 8 were compared with similar tunnels on the German A 71, A 38 and A 4 motorways, as there were no similar tunnels on the A 17.
In the preparation of this part of the examination, a precise definition of the concept of price was important.
For the comparison of bridge prices, both courts agreed on detailed specifications, such as: to use the current price paid for the bridge without VAT.
 (VAT rates in the Czech Republic and Germany are different and may change) not to take into account the cost of special start-up measures, to use for currency conversion the rate of the European Central Bank of 30.12.2005. (29 CZK = 1 Euro).
Bridges of various types (steel concrete, prestressed concrete, steel composite and steel) and of different sizes are available both on the D 8 and on the A 17.
In order to ensure the comparability of the tested bridge structures, the bridges were grouped according to their design.
The analyses also took into account the bridge size within these groups.
By far the most common on both sides of the border were concrete bridges (20 bridges on the D8 and 36 bridges on the A17).
The study focused on this type of bridge, as the size of the sample allowed the use of mathematical statistical methods and improved the reliability of the results.
The study showed that the m2 price of the concrete bridges on the D 8 / A 17 depends on the size of the bridge (length, road surface): the larger the bridge, the lower the price per square metre.
In the case of German bridges, the correlation between price and size is more pronounced than in the case of Czech bridges (see figures below).
Two bridges were found on the A 17 and four on the D 8 at a significantly higher price.
These bridges were determined partly by a method for detecting significant deviations within a sample and partly by regression analysis of the correlation between bridge price and size (based on the distance to the regression curve, atypically expensive bridges can be identified).
However, the atypically high price of these bridges should only serve as an indication of which bridges to focus on.
In order to draw definitive conclusions, the causes of the respective high price have to be determined on a case-by-case basis.
This could be due, for example, to uneconomic management, but also to environmental protection requirements or other legitimate reasons.
Taking into account the larger average length of Czech concrete bridges compared to the German ones (see table 1), the proven negative correlation between the price of the bridge and the length expected the Czech concrete bridges to be cheaper.
This was also supported by the lower labour costs in the Czech Republic compared to Germany.
However, the evaluation of the results showed that the price of the concrete bridges on the D 8 is higher than on the A 17.
Two reasons for this were identified during joint discussions:
1.
In Germany, construction contracts for bridges are mostly awarded separately.
This also allows medium-sized companies to participate in the award competition.
In the Czech Republic, many bridge buildings are awarded as part of larger contracts for the construction of several kilometres of motorway sections.
Orders of this magnitude cannot be handled by medium-sized companies.
2.
In the Czech Republic, the variety of bridge constructions built is greater than in Germany.
In this context, the NKÚ noted that the construction of bridges will be determined long before the start of construction,
This is already the case when the application for planning is submitted by the RMD.
At this point, it chooses a particular type of bridge construction from several alternatives, but profitability plays a minor role in this decision.
Only a thorough analysis of the construction sectors of both countries would have made it possible to reach a final conclusion with regard to bridge prices in the Czech Republic and Germany, but this would have gone beyond the scope of this examination.
The border bridge is the most expensive steel bridge on the D 8 and A 17.
The prices for the tunnels on the D 8 are about twice as high as in Germany.
However, a comparison of the technical parameters between the tunnels on the D 8 and the tunnels in Germany showed no significant difference.
The significant price differentials may result from under-developed competition for tunnel construction in the Czech Republic.
However, the small number of tunnels did not allow for generalising conclusions.
Efficiency and effectiveness of the Dresden-Prague motorway
The independent Czech Republic was founded in 1993.
In the same year, the government approved the plan for the extension of the motorway network.
The plan was to gradually expand the D8 from Prague to the state border with Germany.
The section 0805 should be built through the Bohemian Central Mountains in front of the borderline section 0807.
The Czech Republic finances the D8 as part of the programme's financing.
The programme number 327 220 "Construction of the D 8 Prague motorway - Ústí nad Labem - Czech national border" defines two objectives:
1.
As a national objective: to improve the connection between Prague and Ústi nad Labem;
2.
As an international goal: the connection between Prague and Berlin as part of Pan-European Transport Corridor IV BerlinIstanbul.
The programme planned to complete the construction of the section leading through the Bohemian Central Mountains in June 2008 and the construction of the cross-border section 0807 in June 2007.
It should be noted that the end of the works is not identical to the date of commissioning.
The NKÚ noted that the planning decision had already been taken for the construction of the section leading through the Bohemian Central Mountains.
Environmental groups have appealed against this decision.
A final verdict has yet to be reached.
In comparison with the timetable provided for in the programme documentation, it was therefore not possible to rule out a delay in the completion of section No. 0805 for several years.
In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed a postponement of the completion date of the construction phase No. 0805 to 2010.
As a result, the construction of the border section did not achieve the national goal of improving the connection between Prague and Usti nad Labem.
The RMD examined the cross-border section No. 0807 of the D8 and Section No. 0805 of the Bohemian Central Mountains in the years 1999 to 2001.
The investment costs were approximately Euro639 million for both sections No. 0805 and No. 0807.
Table 2: results of the economics study (EIRR = internal rate of interest) 
Variant Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.
Traffic in the northern part of the border section 18,000 cars per day in 2010.
Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.
Traffic in the northern part of the border section 22 000 cars per day in 2010.
Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.
Traffic in the northern part of the border section 25 000 cars per day in 2010.
The economic feasibility study carried out in 2001 was based on the assumption that the cross-border section and the section leading through the Bohemian Central Mountains will be cut off at the same time.
At the time of the examination, it was obvious that the section through the Bohemian Central Mountains would not be opened to the original date.
This reduces the above-mentioned EIRR values.
The cost of both sections as of 31 December 2005 was Euro897 million excluding VAT, 27.4% higher than in the 2001 economic assessment.
In addition, there is a risk that Section 0805 will have a different, more complex internal process, which would affect the cost-effectiveness of the project.
The economic assessment showed that the construction of both sections of the motorway, with a daily traffic of at least 18 000 cars per day in 2010, is economically justified. The forecast for 2008 had predicted 22 940 cars per day.
However, a study of diversion routes as an alternative to the missing section through the Bohemian Central Mountains predicts a traffic volume of 12,600 to 13,750 cars per day in 2007 and the project is below the economic efficiency limit.
A higher volume of traffic on the routes intended to replace the missing section with the Bohemian Central Mountains is likely to result in congestion and thus increased external costs, which were not taken into account in the initial economic assessment.
The mentioned reduction in revenue and increase in costs means that the already low EIRR for the construction of the cross-border section of the D 8 will not be achieved.
The construction of the border section of the D 8 is therefore uneconomic.
The construction of the A 17 also saw an increase in costs, such as the construction of the two above-mentioned sections of the D 8.
In the context of the overall economic assessment for the Federal Transport Route Plan in 1992, the Federal Ministry of Transport assumed investment costs of around Euro320 million.
In doing so, it determined a benefit/cost ratio of 4.6.
In the meantime, costs have increased to around Euro670 million and the benefit/cost ratio has been reduced by more than half.
Regardless of the parallel tests with the NKÚ in the years 2003 to 2005, the BRH had examined the cost-effectiveness of the planning and construction of the A17 motorway.
He noted that the authority responsible for the approval called for an unnecessary landscape tunnel for the third section of the A17.
In the course of the examination, the BRH succeeded in convincing the Federal Ministry and the road construction administration of the excess fluidity of the landscape tunnel.
This has prevented Euro10 million in construction costs and Euro150,000 in annual operating costs.
When examining the first section of the A17, the BRH found that the construction was insufficiently prepared.
The following example illustrates this:
During the planning phase, the administration of the road construction refrained from recording the condition of the rock on the surface of the Dölzschen wall, as it was difficult to access it.
It wasn't until the tunnel drive reached the wall that she caught up with it.
It turned out that the rock was more weathered than was assumed at the tender.
Costly measures such as anchorages, injections and stone-cutting protection nets for around Euro3.3 million were necessary.
The road construction administration not only bore the costs for additional, already necessary ironworks, such as securing the Dölzschen wall, but also for those that would not have been necessary if the building had been properly prepared.
These include expenses resulting from disrupted construction processes (Euro3.2 million), additional training of the propulsion team (Euro0.5 million) and increased wages and material prices due to the extension of construction time (Euro7 million).
This additional expenditure of around Euro10.7 million has no lasting added value.
The BRH took this and other measures as an opportunity to call on the Federal Ministry to make better use of its specialist supervision of major road construction measures.
In this context, it should insist that road building authorities introduce quality assurance systems.
Benefits of cooperation for BRH and NKÚ The cooperation met the expectations of both audit institutions.
The BRH received information on the planning, procurement and implementation of the construction of the border bridge.
Both audit institutions developed a database on bridge and tunnel prices, which will be helpful for future audits.
The NKÚ found that the most important structural parameters for bridges, tunnels and roadway of the D8 are not different from those of the A17.
The auditors from both audit institutions involved in the cooperation gained valuable experience, which will be useful in future audits.

FC Schalke 04 after beating Mainz: You felt the fear
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief at Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
However, the time factor also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
That was no different in the home match against Mainz 05.

And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty area," said Schalke 04's sports executive - and breathed a sigh of relief.
After all, the Königsblauen still managed to wrap up the narrow 1-0 win against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first win of the season.
In fact, things could have been different.
After the lead given by Alessandro Schöpf 11th to the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco, Tedesco said: "In sum, the first half was good, both playful and pressing," the head obviously played more and more with the length of the game.
Don't actually make a header monster
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours for me," said Heidel. "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore retreated further and further.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three counts of the season.
"We all liked a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who had no insignificant part in it with his header: "I'm actually the worst header player in the team."
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, including, of course, Tedesco.
"We wanted to start presciently in the early stages and make a firework out of it," said Schalke's head coach.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can look forward to a few hours.

"then it wouldn't have been a treble victory," said Tedesco: "You've already felt the fear a bit."
