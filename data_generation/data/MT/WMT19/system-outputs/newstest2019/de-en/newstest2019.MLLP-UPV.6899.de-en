DFB chief Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB president Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil to return to the national team.
"This is a question that depends, of course, on the fact that you get into the conversation, that you also talk to him about why he apparently felt one or the other in the way that is laid down in his statement," Grindel said in the football podcast "Phrasenmoher" of the "Bild" newspaper.
Despite months of debate over Özil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of 92-time national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued playing for Germany.
I also assumed up to a certain point that this would be the case, "Grindel said.
The 29-year-old declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and justified it by saying that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The head of the DFB reiterated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with German coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to create any pressure, but he knows from football that "when you leave a team or change a club, you talk to your coach about it and I think it's a pity that this conversation hasn't come about so far."

Returned from the Ethnological Museum to Native People in Alaska
The Foundation for Prussian Cultural Property (SPK) will return nine objects from the collection of the Ethnological Museum of the State Museums in Berlin to the Chugach Alaska Corporation.
The Board of Trustees has today approved a corresponding proposal from the President.
The objects are funerary gifts from Native people from southwest Alaska.
They were among the objects that Johan Adrian Jacobsen, who travelled between 1882 and 1884 to the American north-west coast and Alaska on behalf of the then Royal Museum of Ethnology (now the Ethnological Museum), brought to Berlin.
Hermann Parzinger, president of SPK, said:
"At the time, the objects were unlawfully taken from the graves of their deceased without the consent of the Native People, so they do not belong in our museums."
"We will now return you to Chugach Alaska Corporation, with whom we have been collaborating since 2015 on the reworking of our collection."
In the future, the reinstated objects will be presented in the Chugach Community, among others within the annual Chugach Spirit Camp, which serves the exchange of knowledge between the generations and the various tribes that now belong to the Chugach.
As part of John Johnson's current visit to Berlin, a memorandum of understanding with the Ethnological Museum has also been prepared.
The objects are burial objects from Chenega Island and Sanradna, now unknown, in Kachemak Bay.
Among them are two broken masks and a children's sash, as well as a wooden idol.
After use, masks were mostly burned or placed in graves, which is why today there are not many masks of the Chugach.
The red colour on them points to the funeral context.
The wood idol is believed to be a shamanic figure who was supposed to protect people from danger and death.
In total, the Ethnological Museum owns almost 200 objects of the Chugach.
The Chugach region in southwest Alaska has been home to thousands of people who call themselves Sugpiaq or Alutiiq and used to be called Pacific Eskimos.
About 1,000 to 1,500 years ago, Athabasan-speaking Indian groups, today's Dena'ina (formerly called Tanaina), also immigrated.
Today, Alaskan natives who call themselves Chugach live around Prince William Sound and Cook Inlet.
They live in seven communities: Chenega, Eyak, Nanwalek, Port Graham, Seward, Tatilek and Valdez.
Regular contacts with Europe have existed since the time of Tsar Peter the Great.
In November 2015, a delegation of the Chugach Alaska Corporation visited the Ethnological Museum with the aim of initiating cooperation for future projects.
Among other things, the background was the interest to create a virtual collection of all Chugach objects worldwide.
Subsequently, the Corporation asked the Ethnological Museum for assistance in the repatriation of any burial objects available in the region.
Chugach Alaska Corporation (www.chugach-ak.com) has been an advocacy group for Native people in the Chugach region of Alaska since 1972.
Among other things, it is committed to preserving the cultural heritage of these groups.
The government of the USA supported the request for return by means of a diplomatic note.
In accordance with its basic approach to dealing with its non-European collections and research into its provenance, the SPK carefully examined the context in which the burial objects, which are in the Ethnological Museum, originate.
In the present case, everything indicates that the objects originate from a burial plot and not from an approved archaeological excavation.
It is clear from Adrian Jacobsen's travel diaries that the graves were only opened for the purpose of extracting their contents.

At the end of the 19th century, Johan Adrian Jacobsen travelled to the American Northwest Coast and Alaska for the Berlin Ethnology Museum.
For the purpose of building a collection, the director of the museum, Adolf Bastian, had commissioned it to collect objects as "original" as possible, uninfluenced by European culture.
Jacobsen brought around 3000 objects from the northwest coast and around 4000 objects from Alaska to Berlin.

Treysa is struggling with vandalism and rubbish
The entrance to the 36-kilometre-long railway cycle path in the Red Riding Hood region in Treysa is difficult to find and littered.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are scarcely emerging.
Shards, cigarette butts, rubbish and rubbish, demolished rubbish bins and now dismantled signs - this is how the entrance to the bike path on the Haaße Hill in Treysa has been presented for some time.
For the showpiece object, the railway cycle path in Rotkäppchenland is more than an unruly sight.
The topic has also been occupied by members of the local ADFC group Schwalmstadt and others for some time, according to Ulrich Wüstenhagen, the city's cycling commissioner.
The problem has already been addressed in the Cycling Advisory Council.
So far, there is no solution.
The proposals ranged from the installation of the seating group to the regular emptying of the waste bins and the cleaning of the areas at the entrance.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also brought the issue to the local advisory council.
It is not just the rubbish that drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting place for celebrations at weekends.
Not only does it often get loud, but it also destroys the railings: Knocks poles out of the ground, demolishes rubbish bins, knocks over signs, smears seating furniture.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions, however, are only the proverbial drop in the ocean.
They are angry that the rest area on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting place for refreshments.
"Along the entire cycle path, the focus here is clearly on the Haaße Hill," confirms the cycling commissioner, who is now also concerned about the new cycling facility in Ziegenhain, which will open today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea is video surveillance on the hillside: "This may set the threshold much higher for trespassing on public property.

It must be made more attractive.

Music Contest at the Culture Station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in togetherness.
"D a song for Hiltrup," is the appeal of the Hiltrup district offensive, in the "Music contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians."
A contest "with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family," as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family meeting for coffee and cake by the volunteers of the Culture Station.
There were seven groups, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, an Albany long living in Hiltrup, the Nine of the "Hiltruper Star Colors," three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Lummerland Kindergarten and finally the Rider Zwarties and ZWeßling.
This contest, declared district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We have not yet seen that in other parts of the city.
What did the copywriters see as connected?
The towns of Hiltruper See and Marktallee were particularly frequently mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue "Kö von Hiltrup" in his hit-like song.
The cultural station was also honoured.
Time and again, it was a matter of experiencing togetherness in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about their work.
So it was learned from Humberg that he had actually studied chemistry, but was now also teaching guitar.
From the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke knew that he had recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the programme.
And Alvin Jasic has put a lot of things on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a present from Hiltrup gastronomy.
Nevertheless, there was something special for the jury's favourites - so that others could also listen to their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel untied can record an entire CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup hit, which particularly impressed Franke with its musicality, and the "Lummerland pack": "A very beautiful performance" with ten children and two teachers on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children made another appearance at the finals - and even sounded "really good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KVG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the business association as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive launched the event on the occasion of its tenth anniversary.

The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each side there is a screen, in which there are four cards with keywords, which you can only decipher - the old trick with the red foil - once you have put them in.
This ensures that the other side cannot read anything by mistake.
On the cards, for example, you can read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2 window.
3. Dice.
4th feast. "
These are the terms that will henceforth have to be coded.
After all, it is not the concepts that should be guessed, but codes.
Alternately one player per team is the encoder.
He gets a code card that says "3.4.2."
In "Decrypto," it is not the terms behind the secret slide that are to be guessed, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "cube," "feast" and "window" in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not, if possible, win the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
The encoder thus notes and reads aloud: "Throw" for the dice, "lots" as a contrast to the party; here, of course, something like "party" and "Prague" would be possible, because he paid attention at school and knows the crash of the windows there.
So it goes on round by round, team by team.
You may not know the terms of the other side, but you can better rhyme with any hint that the encoder gives there.
The transcriptions should be as mysterious as possible, but not too twisted, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "decrypto" is the rule book.
The players will probably have to study it quite long and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanatory video at decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But once you get started, you will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game.

On her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dream ship," Heide Keller became a star.
Now she speaks openly about the fact that the series may have been complicit in her marriage break-up with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as the head hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "dream ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1st, 2018, she went on board forever.
The series that made her a star could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That may also have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, travelled around the world alone with a suitcase, and many colleagues I admired saw me at eye level, "says Keller in an interview with Bild am Sonntag.
At first she was only "the wife of Hans von Borsody," but that changed with the "dream ship."
Because now the journalists only called at Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it that much."
She thinks it is possible that her then husband may have been envious, but "like many men, Hans was afraid of talking about problems and feelings."
Keller had always tried to be "the only right thing for Hans von Borsody" and he did not want to get to know my fears, my weaknesses.
This means in good German: I have changed my mind, "she explains.
She had always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman who, in truth, I never was, even though I sometimes appeared cheeky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever. "
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid that it might go wrong a second time."
The day before the civil ceremony, I sat in the cloakroom howling and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why it never worked out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
At the time, Keller had imagined love "like in the film."
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday life.
I approached love far too naively. "

Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Send after last-minute bust "destroyed on the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball association ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat." His defenders were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29: 30 (12: 14) - bust - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.
As in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, they had not played badly over long periods, the Sendens said.
Only the initial phase "did we fall asleep completely," the ASV coach was annoyed.
The hosts quickly led with 8: 1, and even the early break that Bieletzki had taken did not bear fruit at first.
"But then suddenly a ruck went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter of an hour.

But they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now it must be a damn victory," said Bieletzki, who served completely.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).

About 150 bikers celebrate service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schroeder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service for the motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
At least the final service for the bikers was on the agenda.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and is thus responsible for the pastoral concerns of the two-wheelers, who are strong on horsepower.
Between April and September, the traditional motorbike service (MoGo) takes place on the last Sunday of a month at Haus Nordhelle.
Bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Peace Church in Eveking.
On Sunday, around 150 bikers gathered there to conduct a service that was anything but ordinary.
As early as 10 a.m., the cars were lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
First of all, the biker early shopping was on the agenda and could be strengthened with coffee and cake, or even with a hearty curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, there were also Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach.
The sermon was delivered during the biker service by priest Dirk Grählrek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical background.
"Although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill strikes a more poetic and calm tone," said Pastor Frank Schröder.
This too was certainly a novelty in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.

1: 4 against Frankfurt: Hanover with fourth bust of the season: "Shitty situation"
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth successive Bundesliga defeat, coach André breitenreiter rallied his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around him and courted them.
However, there was not much positive in the 1: 4 (0: 2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you've got to get out of it as a team," said 96-year-old football professional Pirmin Schwegler, pausing: "It's disappointing, of course, because you always have a lot going for you."
The still undefeated Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86th) joined, are at the bottom with two counts and are a relegation candidate in their current condition.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt, on the other hand, celebrated their first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored in front of 46,300 spectators for the DFB cup winner, who, after the successful rehearsal for the Europa League match against Lazio in Rome, advanced to the mid-table with seven points.
Croatia's vice-world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of the Hessen in his starting debut and never got to grips with Hannover's defence.
With his pace and assertiveness, the striker, who was a long shot after the World Cup, showed why he is so valuable for the tie.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, who was on loan from Liverpool FC, was for the first time in the initial formation of Frankfurt, which began to swing.
A header deflected onto the net by Lucas Torró (17th) put them in danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller, in a promising position, was stopped at the last moment by the 96 defence around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the owners was almost inevitable and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a deflected corner, Haller extended it head-on in front of the goal, where Ndicka only needed to keep his foot up.
It was the first league goal for the defender, who came from the French second-division side AJ Auxerre in the summer.

At half-time, Hannover coach reacted more broadly to the poor performance of his team, bringing in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt two new offensive forces.
Although the Lower Saxony played a little more boldly forward, igniting ideas remained until just before the end, when the connecting goal was still possible.
The Hessen were much more efficient.
After less than an hour, Rebic launched a solo shot and then put it squarely on De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty net.
The rest was just a show for the Frankfurt team against overwhelmed guests, with Jovic also hitting a minute before the end.

Inauguration: New residential home on Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstrasse
In Münsterblickstrasse, Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller is opening a new residential home for people with disabilities.
The fact that "a very special house" is now being handed over to its destination in Münsterblickstrasse - all those present at the inauguration were in agreement.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the living quarters of the Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time depend on the special architecture of the new building.
In his concept, architect Rudolf Bader has considered wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas.
The first planning began around eight years ago, when the former US Army officer's building was put to the test for residents with a mobile phone cap: "The house had come into the years and was no longer up-to-date in terms of equipment," Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, excavators arrived to demolish the house.
The new building should be as friendly and bright as possible, so that residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Life support Danube-Iller opens new residential home
Life support invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.

The life support manager, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between an barrier-free and at the same time fire-safe construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen, with the many requirements, had built a home that allowed the residents the freedom to move even without foreign help.
Gertrud Kreutmayer, head of the social administration of the district of Swabia, said similarly: "The house is oriented towards the special needs of its inhabitants, who need tools to be mobile."
The comfort and functionality were well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The property in this location is a real stroke of luck, because it can no longer be purchased in the current situation."
In total, the new residential home in Münsterblickstrasse offers space on almost 1500 square metres for 30 people with disabilities, divided into three residential groups.
Life support managing director Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed according to tariffs.

Colour powder and eggs: Barcelona riots ahead of Catalonia anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of Catalonia's disputed independence referendum.
But there have been riots before.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017, clashes broke out between separatists and police in central Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence demonstrators with paint powder, among other things, as they tried to prevent them from approaching a National Police and Civil Guard demonstration.
Around 3000 officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units planned to pay tribute to their colleagues who were at the polling stations last year in what was considered an illegal referendum.
The attempt to prevent citizens from voting also resulted in violence at the time.
The Catalan police have formed a chain to keep separatist demonstrations and central state security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
However, some of the 6000 or so separatists then attempted to break through the police chain by force and threw bags of paint and eggs at the officers, among others.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured, the authorities said.

Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Assembled helplessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate without a goal
Red-white Ahlen continues to stand on the spot.
Even with FC Gütersloh, it was only a 0-0 draw.
In front of 438 spectators at the Heidewaldstadion, the final and the third last one turned out to be a total of perplexity.
The first half was very manageable due to the entertainment factor.
Therefore, those who preferred to get a beer or a bratwurst could do so without worry.
There was no risk of missing a goal chance, because there was practically none.
First shot after half an hour
For the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire match, Nick Flock was responsible for the goods in the 28th minute.
The Ahleners had the best - and in principle the only real - opportunity when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling into a parade with a shot from the penalty area after 32 minutes.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, Sinan Aygün came for him.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the increasing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel aimed from 18 metres just over the crossbar and after an hour, the Gütersloans also made an offensive appearance for the first time.
After Matthew Wieckowicz won the ball, things were fixed.
Nick Flock (62) "crowned" the keeper of Sinan Aygün, who was quickly subdued, with a shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
They also trailed by a header from Wieckowicz (66.) after a corner ball from ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut reacted, bringing first Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.).
It worked - nothing.
The Ahleners did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
It was only in the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but neither did he score.
Angelo Daut then tried to point out the positive: "I like the fact that we played to zero," but unfortunately the zero was also at the front.
"We were not as dangerous as against Holzwickede this time and even though our opponent had no desire to play here," said RW Ahlen's interim coach.
Offensively, "everything was a little bit like that" against a team "that just wanted to defend.
In any case, I didn't feel we could get the opposite, "Daut said.
To his sorrow, however, the spectator did not feel as if his team could score a goal.
The performance was too poor for that.

Lubricants with a local political message: Not a successful advertisement for a skate park
In Lengerich, unknowns have promoted the construction of a skate facility in a way that is hardly conducive.
There are lubricants in several places, says Jürgen Kohne from the city council, when asked by the WN.
In at least one case, criminal charges of property damage have been filed with the police.
The three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" Are emblazoned in large letters on signs at, among others, the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that already after the trade fair on 19 September, a corresponding lettering was discovered on the advertising sign at the staircase to the Gempt bistro.
Since the short message was apparently "only" left with Edding at the time, it could easily be removed.
"A few days later, however, it was back, this time sprayed," Rottmann said.
He believes that the appropriate advertising label must be replaced.
This case gets a special note precisely because several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skatepark is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
According to Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department of school, sport and culture, there are already commitments, without mentioning names.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that stand on the smeared plaque.

Air traffic control bottleneck gets worse
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong winds and then the storm will come," the head of the air traffic control union, Matthias Maas, told the German Press Agency ahead of the aviation summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight cancellations is the long-known shortage of staff in European air traffic control systems, for which there is no quick fix.
"Airlines and airports can make rapid improvements for the coming year, but training new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.

Maas again blamed the European Commission's requirements for the pilot malaise.

The resulting cost requirements and personnel savings in national air traffic control systems are now fully reflected in the operating business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that "do not cut off the air even further" for air traffic control systems.
At the moment, the EU guidelines are being coordinated until 2024 and further tightening is to be feared.
The EU is subject to constant lobbying from airlines.
"Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have been sowing themselves over the last few years," said Maas.
He hopes that the high cost of delays will lead airlines to rethink their thinking.
The GdF will only cooperate in improving the situation if German air traffic control (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future pact," said Maas.
The previously announced intake of 120 pilot pupils a year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for the age-related declines.

Public procurement of works and prevention of corruption
Joint report by the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NK) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel audits
Introduction and overview
The award of services by public authorities is of great importance for the state as well as for the economy.
The state has the task of using public funds as economically and economically as possible, as well as ensuring fair and regulated competition.
In the European Union (EU), the award of services by public authorities is an important element in the creation of a single economic area.
In order to be able to ensure a largely unrestricted competition across borders, the contracting authorities have to comply with EU requirements for their contracts above certain value limits (thresholds).
For this purpose, the EU member states have to transfer and apply the EU's public procurement law into national law.
This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.
It is up to individual countries to regulate the award of public contracts below the EU threshold.
In addition, the award of services is also an area at risk of corruption.
Due to the fundamentally high potential for damages, the contracting authorities therefore have to implement appropriate measures to prevent corruption and inadmissible benefits in the award of their contracts and to prevent them.
In January 2011, the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (NCA) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed to carry out parallel audits for the EU-wide allocation of construction services as well as for the prevention of corruption.
The tests focused on the application of the EU public procurement law, which has been transposed into national regulations, as well as the prevention of corruption in the award of construction services in the construction, road construction and transport infrastructure.
The awards below the EU threshold were also included in the considerations with regard to the prevention of corruption.
The audit results of both courts are summarised in this joint report.
The report should also be addressed to international bodies, such as the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).
Auditing areas and audited bodies The evaluations of the Federal Audit Office on the listed topics are mainly based on cross-sectional audits, which he carried out in 2011 / 2012 in the construction services, which are responsible for the construction of roads and buildings of the Federal Government in Germany.
He examined, for example, the construction of motorways and major construction projects.
In addition, the Federal Audit Office drew on results from previous investigations.
From 2008 to 2011, the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic based its evaluations of the results of the examinations, which included construction measures in road construction, railway track construction, hydroelectric construction, building construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.) and other construction areas in the Czech Republic.
The award of public contracts by the federal government is mainly carried out in Germany by the building services of the federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the state building administration is centrally responsible for public contracts in the field of transport infrastructure.
In the construction, the contracts are carried out in a decentralized manner by those bodies that use the state budget.
In both countries, freelancers will also be involved in parts of the tendering procedures.
When comparing the evaluations, differences in the procurement law and the market structure for construction services in both countries must be taken into account.
Development of public procurement law in both countries
In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide tendering procedures is laid down in laws and regulations.
Procurement procedures limited to the national area are governed by budgetary law and the administrative provisions that are based on it.
In addition, for both EU-wide and national awards, many complementary individual regulations are provided for by internal administrative provisions,
Such as the so-called "award books" of the Federal Government, in which the legal requirements are supplemented or formulated in greater detail, in accordance with the law on public procurement.
In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure is governed exclusively by the Public Procurement Act and other legal requirements, which apply to areas above and below EU thresholds.
The law on public procurement was significantly amended in 2012.
The new regulation increased transparency in the handling of public funds, allowed for greater competition and limited the opportunities for corruption in the procurement procedure.
Guidelines of public procurement law in both countries
In both countries, EU-wide contracts are subject in particular to the open procedure, the non-open procedure and the negotiation procedure.
In Germany, the measures below the EU threshold are subject to the national types of tendering (public tender, limited tender, open-ended award), which, however, largely correspond to the EU-wide types of tendering mentioned above.
Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of priority of the open procedure (for EU-wide contracts) and the public tender procedure (for national contracts).
Any interested company can submit an offer at the open procedure and at the public tender.
Another essential feature of German public procurement law is the promotion of medium-sized enterprises.
The division of an overall construction project into technical and partial ones serves this purpose above all.
The individual award of these lots is intended to enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.
Both of the above features of German public procurement law are proven tools for achieving economic results.
In Germany there are over 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees.
In the Czech Republic, EU-wide tendering procedures are also applicable to projects below the EU threshold.
An exception here is the simplified procedure, in which a less stringent procedure may be applied below the thresholds and under certain conditions.
Czech public procurement law, in accordance with EU law, provides for contracts to be concluded if competition is guaranteed and a favourable price is achieved.
The current legal regulations in the Czech Republic allow contracting authorities to choose between the open and the not open procedure.
There are over 85,000 construction companies in the Czech Republic, including around 1,900 companies with 20 or more employees.
Volume of public contracts and shares of the types of contracts in both countries
In Germany, the total construction volume in 2011 was 307 billion euros.
Of this, public construction (15%) accounted for 45.5 billion euros, which includes, in addition to the federal construction, in particular the construction measures of the federal states and municipalities.
The construction volume of the federal government in the construction and construction of highways (without railway track construction and hydroelectric construction) amounted to 8.5 billion euros.
The volume of contracts for construction services in the construction and highway construction of the federal government was distributed among the types of contracts in 2011 as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public tenders, 12.7% not open procedures and restricted tenders and 6.6% negotiation procedures and public contracts.
Of these, 33.2% were Europe-wide contracts.
The volume of public works in the Czech Republic amounted to 4.7 billion Euros in 2011, which was about 25% of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.
In 2009, the volume was 7.8 billion euros, corresponding to 37% of the total construction volume.
Breakdown by type of tender for 2011: 65.1% open procedure, 14.3% non-public procedure, 9.5% negotiation procedure, 8.4% simplified procedure for volume of contracts, below the 2.7% threshold
The data refer to all public contracts for deliveries, services and construction services awarded by public contracting authorities in 2011.
The above data show that the parallel audits of both countries are directed at a significant part of public contracts, which are of great financial importance in the prevention of corruption in all contracts, and which have a prominent place in the award of contracts through the open procedure and the public tender.
Summary of the results of the parallel tests
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NK) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have carried out parallel audits in their countries for the EU-wide allocation of construction services and for the prevention of corruption.
In this context, the working groups of both courts compared the appropriate legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany, as well as the results of their parallel audits, which they carried out in particular in the fields of construction and road construction.
In doing so, they found essentially:
The EU directives on the award of works by public authorities have been transposed into national law in both the Czech Republic and Germany (points 1 and 3.1).
In addition to the EU requirements, the two countries' public procurement regulations, which differ in part in their focus and detail, serve to prevent corruption (No. 3.2).
In both countries, a fundamental requirement of the award documents is that they must contain all the information required for the proper preparation of an offer.
The performance descriptions must be neutral and must not be subject to advertising restrictions.
In Germany, the award documents have largely complied with these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, it is still a problem to determine the object of the order sufficiently.
In Germany, construction services have to be divided into lots, if possible, in order to promote competition.
According to the findings of the BRH, this requirement has been largely implemented in Germany.
In its tests, especially in the field of road construction, the NCA found that the award of extensive services without lots or with very large lots can hamper competition and lead to a restriction on only a few large companies.
Narrowing the market potential can lead to significant increases in costs and risk price or other collusion.
According to the regulations of both countries, the contracting bodies can, under certain conditions, in principle agree with the already commissioned companies on additional or amended services, which prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (No. 4.1).
The respective requirements for determining the type of contract were largely followed in both countries.
According to the regulations of the Czech Republic, the awarding bodies can choose between open and non-open procedures.
In Germany, on the other hand, the priority of the open procedure for EU-wide tenders, which corresponds to the open procedure for national contracts, is legally and budgetary.
This will allow more companies to make offers.
This reduces the risk of corruption, makes price fixing between bidders more difficult and leads to the most economic results.
In the case of construction projects whose estimated total contract values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited building services awarded the construction services in principle throughout Europe.
The correct estimation of the expected contract value is an essential basis for choosing the right type of contract.
In Germany, cost databases are used to determine the costs of public buildings, in particular in the construction sector.
Which are based on the evaluations of completed construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the field of road construction, but it is not yet an effective instrument (No. 4.2).
Preliminary information and announcements are to be published for construction services to be awarded throughout Europe, which should strengthen the competition by enabling interested companies to adapt to the planned contracts at an early stage.
The audited building services generally complied with this requirement.
In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or a lack of controls may affect competition (point 4.3).
The selection of candidates for participation in non-public procurement procedures is particularly susceptible to manipulation.
Under EU law, the number of invited candidates must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not discriminate and must be disclosed beforehand.
In addition to the requirements of the EU, the contracting bodies in both countries should switch among the companies to be required as frequently as possible when selecting the candidates.
In order to counter the threat of manipulation, there are in some cases very detailed guidelines in Germany.
In some cases, the audited administrations disregarded these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, decisions on the selection of candidates were not always comprehensible (point 4.4).
In both countries, during the bidding phase, in the interests of equal competition, it must be ensured that the companies interested in submitting an offer receive the same information.
To avoid anti-competitive collusion, a contact between these companies and freelancers, who were involved in the creation of the service description, must be avoided as far as possible.
The corresponding regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.
However, the audited building services in Germany sometimes did not comply with these requirements (No. 4.5).
When opening the offers, the principle of transparency and the principle of multi-eyes must be observed in both countries.
The requirements for marking, documentation, custody and confidentiality of the offers are intended to limit the scope for manipulation and are particularly well defined in Germany.
Tests in both countries showed few complaints (point 4.6).
In both countries, the assessment and evaluation of the offers are determined by requirements for the organisation of construction and the organisation of operations.
The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been consistently observed by the audited contracting bodies.
For example, awarding agencies passed on offers for inspection to third parties, without first looking through the offers and sufficiently documenting conspicuous events.
As a result, the offers were insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulation (No. 4.7).
At the conclusion of the EU-wide tendering procedures, the companies taking part in the competition will be informed of the intended assignment prior to the award of the contract.
This legal protection also has a preventive function against corrupt behaviour.
The Czech Republic also provides for the possibility of judicial review for non-EU tendering procedures.
Only in a few cases did the awarding authorities not respect the specified deadlines in the award of contracts or deviate from the bidders' offer in terms of content (point 4.8).
The documentation of the tendering procedures was not always complete or comprehensible for the audited building services in both countries.
In this respect, the EU-wide requirement for transparency was not sufficiently implemented in the award notices of some procedures.
Also, some of the shortcomings identified diminished the anti-corruption function of the documentation.
The contracting authorities of both countries largely complied with their reporting and reporting obligations (point 4.9).
Foundations of EU public procurement law and the prevention of corruption
EU public procurement law
In order to ensure unrestricted competition within the European Union with free movement of services and goods, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, among other things, the award coordination and appeal directives, which were to be transposed into national law by the eight Member States.
The general award principles of the European Union are, in particular, the principle of competition, the principle of equal treatment or the prohibition of discrimination, as well as the requirement of transparency.
In order to achieve these objectives, the award coordination directive contains specific regulations for building services to be awarded across the EU for construction projects.
In order to do this, their prospective orders must reach or exceed the current sum of 5,000,000 euros.
The regulations concern in particular the content of the award documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, the adherence to deadlines, inter alia for the receipt of the bids, the documentation of the award procedure, the requirements that can be placed on the qualification of the candidates and the appeal directive forms the basis for the legal protection of the applicants and bidders.
In the case of possible violations of public procurement law, affected companies can have the decisions of public contracting authorities reviewed in review proceedings.
Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the directives of the European Union into national law.
Prevention of corruption
The importance of preventing corruption
There is no legal definition of corruption in either country.
Generally, corruption is the abuse of a position of trust for private gain,
Which is usually caused by the beneficiaries of these decisions.
Corruption can hamper competition and cause significant economic damage.
It is estimated that the global cost of corruption is 5% of the world's economic output.
For the European Union, the cost is estimated at 1%.
In the case of public contracting companies, restrictive agreements or unfair practices can call into question confidence in the integrity and functioning of the administration.
Preventing corruption is therefore one of the basic tasks of public authorities.
In doing so, they will have to check the structure and organisation of their administrations for areas that are particularly susceptible to corruption, in order to make appropriate safeguards against corruption.
Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly reduce the vulnerability of decision-making processes to corrupt abuse.
The award of public works is generally regarded as a particularly corrupt area of work.
Anti-corruption measures
In Germany, corruption - in particular bribery and bribery, as well as the acceptance and approval of benefits - is prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
In order to prevent corruption, the Federal Government has adopted a guideline and recommendations on the prevention of corruption 12 in the federal administration, according to which, in addition to risk analysis, the following basic principles must be observed for the award area: Priority of public tenders and open procedures, the principle of transparency and transparency, the basic separation of planning, awarding and settlement, the proper and complete documentation of procurement procedures.
In addition, further anti-corruption requirements have been incorporated into the public procurement rules.
In 2011, for example, the responsible Federal Ministry of Public Procurement introduced an electronic control system in the area of the federal highways,
The award data - such as the estimated costs and the amount of the order - as well as information on the freelancers involved are collected across the board and evaluated for abnormalities.
In the Czech Republic, corruption is also prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
The legal requirements of transparency and equal treatment of bidders, as well as the prohibition of all discrimination, are the most important principles for preventing corruption.
For public procurement, the Czech government has defined anti-corruption measures in a anti-corruption strategy paper for the years 2011 to 2012 and updated them for the years 2013 to 2014.
Some of the measures recommended in it have already been transposed into national public procurement law and corresponding administrative provisions 14.
The new legislation contains essentially the following rules: Reduction of the threshold for smaller contracts, obligation to make the tenders known to the tendering authority in advance, including the reasons for the tender, prohibition of the restriction of the number of bidders in non-open procedures and thus the abolition of the possibility of bidding by means of lots, introduction of the obligation to publish the contract documents and all the annexes, introduction of the obligation to publish the actual price and the list of subcontractors.
Examination results of the various phases of the award procedure
Tender documents
Award Documents The award documents must contain all the information that bidders need to make a proper bid.
In particular, the award documents must enable a valid calculation.
The bidders must not be given risks that are not calculable for them.
The award documents consist in particular of the description of services and the terms of the contract.
In addition, they contain the requirements for proving the qualifications (suitability) of the bidders as well as the criteria that determine the selection of the most economical bids.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
The requirements of EU law for the award documents are specifically addressed to the technical specifications.
These must be equally accessible to all bidders and should restrict competition as little as possible.
The performance description must be product neutral in principle.
For this reason, information on products or manufacturers as part of the service description is only permitted under strict conditions.
Avoiding anti-competitive requirements in the procurement documents is also a fundamental principle of preventing corruption.
In addition, unclear or incorrect information in the award documents must be avoided, as they open up scope for speculation in the production of the offers and for manipulations in their valuation.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Similar or similar regulations In both countries, EU regulations on technical specifications have been transposed into national law.
In principle, the services are product-neutral without tendering factory specifications.
In the service descriptions, the individual services must normally be subdivided into performance units with specific quantity specifications.
Prices are to be agreed on the basis of performance units (e.g. Euro per m ² or per piece).
Only in exceptional cases can services be defined by functional targets.
In any case, the descriptions must be complete and unambiguous.
They must contain precise figures and must not include services where it is not clear whether they are needed.
Compensation by lump sum or time is to be avoided if possible.
These provisions are intended to prevent speculation and manipulation based on unspecified requirements in the award documents.
The service descriptions must enable bidders to make their offers safely and without extensive preparatory work.
The tender will not be made public until the tender documents have been completed.
Divergent regulations
There is no obligation to tender for construction services in lots in the Czech Republic.
If it is possible according to the type of service to be supervised, the public contracting authorities can divide construction services into several lots.
In Germany, construction services are to be divided into lots, separated by quantity (partial) and / or by type or specialism (non-skilled).
The aim is to enable medium-sized companies to participate in the competition, to expand the number of possible suppliers and to make it more difficult to agree on prices.
This type of award is considered to be the most economical in general.
Evaluation criteria in the Czech Republic must be specified in the award documents, both in the EU-wide and in the national procedures.
This will allow applicants to be fully and conclusively aware of the criteria under which their offers are to be evaluated.
In Germany, the specification of evaluation criteria in EU-wide notices, but at the latest in the award documents, is only required in EU-wide tendering procedures.
In the case of national tendering procedures, the evaluation criteria should only be recorded in an internal administrative notice.
Procurement documents, which are prepared by commissioned freelancers, must not contain any information on these offices or on the planners or experts involved in building construction or road construction in Germany.
The aim is to prevent individual companies from gaining additional information or other illegal competitive advantages without the knowledge of the client about the contact with these freelancers.
This is also the reason why freelancers are not allowed to send tendering documents or interpret planning documents for inspection.
The company's contact person is the client alone.
There is currently no regulation in the Czech Republic.
Additional or amended services, which prove to be necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (amendments), are almost always required for large construction projects.
In both countries, the legal provisions make it possible, to a certain extent, to award additional sums to the company that has already been commissioned, without the need for a public procurement procedure.
According to the EU guidelines and the German regulations, the compensation of supplementary benefits may not exceed half of the main mandate.
In addition, the additional services cannot be separated from the main contract without significant disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.
In the Czech Republic, a tighter limit of 20% applies to a corresponding award without public notice.
However, this may increase the risk of delayed completion of the project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the construction work that is already underway.
If supplementary payments are also transferred to the already commissioned company, an arbitrary price increase for these services by the contractor is in principle not possible according to the regulations in Germany.
In determining the compensation for the additional services, it is to be assumed that the agreed prices and the basis of the price calculation of the order already issued are the basis.
In addition to supplementary benefits, there may also be a reduction in the scope of services.
In the Czech Republic, it is not possible to charge smaller amounts with additional supplementary payments.

BHR
Technical specifications and product-neutral tender
In individual cases, the service descriptions included references to national technical approvals or standards that had already been replaced by Europe-wide standards.
Some performance descriptions also contained product-specific specifications - for example, for graffiti protection, tapes or noise protection panels - without the need for this.
In some cases, performance requirements were described in such detail that only one product was eligible.
Lists of services subdivided according to partial performance
The BRH has not found any infringement of the bid in any of the examined proceedings to tender services in principle in a list of services subdivided according to partial performances.
Completeness of the service descriptions
In the vast majority of cases, the tender documents were completed before the beginning of the tenders.
In some procedures, the tender documents had to be corrected during the tender phase, as some positions or deadlines had changed.
In some cases, the power registers contained positions where it was not clear whether they were needed.
Almost half of the service list for demolition work consisted of such requirements.
Loose and score criteria
For many contracts, there was a lack of the prescribed reason why the benefits, which were mainly advertised to the unskilled, were not further divided into partial ones.
There were no complaints when specifying the criteria to be used in the evaluation of the offers.
References to freelancers
A small part of the performance descriptions contained references to the freelancers involved.
Their names were in part on the cover pages or in attached plans or expert opinions.
In one case, the awarding authority even expressly asked the applicants to contact the architect "regarding the questions of the tender."
In the construction sector in particular, the awarding bodies attributed the complaints identified mainly to the failings of the freelancers charged with drawing up the service descriptions.
The building services pointed out the lack of capacity in order to be able to sufficiently control the performance descriptions.
NK
Technical specifications and non-product tendering In the public contract for the construction of a residential building with 12 residential units, a supplier and a specific product brand were specified in the service description.
The contracting authority did not allow the use of comparable products without justifying it.
During the construction of several university buildings, suppliers and products were also specified in the tender.
Performance descriptions with power units
In the case of construction projects in some industrial areas, the contracting authority did not clearly specify the scope and type of services required in the service descriptions.
As a power unit, it simply gave the converted space of the individual buildings in cubic metres.
Completeness of the service descriptions
During the construction of a motorway bypass, the service descriptions were amended four times in the period August to September 2009, under a non-open procedure,
Since the scope of services has increased significantly and the technical requirements have changed.
Tender documents for social buildings included inaccurate location information, inadequate preliminary structural studies and incomplete construction drawings, requiring additional services to be commissioned.
During the construction of a large library building, the performance description of the interior did not contain any requirements for product quality.
As a result of these missing requirements, some subcontractors built over-priced and unreasonably high-quality equipment.
Loose and qualifying criteria
In the Czech Republic, the division of construction measures into partial or partial contracts is not mandatory.
An examination of the three major sections of the construction of a motorway ring showed that, if selected parts were allocated on the spot, savings of up to €31.6 million would have been possible, with a total cost of €620.3 million.
For example, in the case of six different buildings alone, which were the subject of a single contract, 2.5 million euros (25%) could have been saved if they had been awarded on the spot.
If the construction of 20 bridges had been awarded on the spot, savings of 11.5 million euros (25%) would have been possible compared with a total allocation.
When awarding construction services in road construction, the central contracting authority set very extensive reference requirements as criteria for suitability.
During the construction of part of a motorway, the tendering authority required bidders in an open procedure to prove, among other things, that at least three road construction projects had been carried out, each worth 28 million euros over the last five years.
In the Czech Republic, a maximum of nine operators met these requirements.
The public procurement of another section of a motorway included six separate construction projects in which the contracting authority had set an annual construction volume of at least 480 million euros in the last three years as a criterion for the suitability of the companies.
Two thirds of the funds raised for road projects in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. 2.5 billion Euros out of a total of 3.7 billion Euros) were allocated by a total of five companies that carried out the contracts alone or as a working group.
In 46 tendering procedures with an order volume of 528 million euros, only two bidders, or even only one bidder, made an offer.
The NICU showed that a reduction in the market potential could lead to significant cost increases.
Additional services
In the case of the construction of a motorway bypass, the contracting authority did not apply any of the procedures required by law when awarding additional services, nor did it conclude any written contracts for the additional services.
Due to unclear quantity and quality requirements, amendments were made in the first case of up to 63.7 million Euro (net) and in the second case up to 165.4 million Euro (net), which increased the respective order volume by 21% and 91% respectively.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
For several university buildings, some services were not listed in the award documents, although their necessity was already known when the award was made.
Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the 20% of the original contract value set by the national public procurement law, the tendering authority conducted negotiations with the contracted companies without announcing the contract.
In the case of the construction of a large courthouse, the tendering authority reserved the right to award additional construction services in negotiations without tendering.
During the construction period, the contracting authority extended the scope of the work by EUR 2 million.
The unit prices for the additional construction work awarded without competition were considerably higher than comparable services provided by the same company.
Further findings
Based on a sampling of construction projects, the NK found that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway in the Czech Republic is up to 14.6 million euros.
In Deuschland, on the other hand, according to an analysis of long-term data from the Federal Ministry of Building, the average cost of a four-lane motorway is up to 10.4 million euros.
This comparison suggests that highway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.
Summary findings
The basic regulations on the award documents are broadly in agreement in both countries and take into account the EU requirements.
They serve both comprehensive and fair competition and the prevention of corruption.
For example, the requirement for the sufficient determination of the service descriptions should enable bidders to properly calculate and create their offers,
Protect the client from additional services to be subsequently agreed and also limit the scope for speculation.
In Germany, the common basic requirements for the award documents are supplemented by regulations that further reduce competition restrictions and opportunities for manipulation.
In the Czech Republic there are no requirements to this extent, but transparency is increased by the publication of the evaluation criteria in non-EU tendering procedures.
The requirements for the performance description have been largely complied with in both countries.
In some cases, however, there have been objections, which may have led to restrictions on competition.
The imperative for the formation of lots in Germany promotes competition and leads to economic results.
In the Czech Republic, according to the audit findings of the NCO, the award of extensive services without lots or with very large lots can lead to restrictions of the provider field on only a few large companies.
The extensive reference requirements in road construction in the Czech Republic have meant that public contracts are only awarded to a narrow range of operators and small and medium-sized enterprises are not allowed to take part in the competition.
Also, a limited number of competitors often lead to higher prices and increase the risk of price or other collusion.
In the case of the award and remuneration of additional or modified services, the regulatory approaches in both countries differ.
According to the EU guidelines and the German regulations, supplementary services with a value of up to half of the main contract can be awarded under certain conditions without a public notice procedure.
In the Czech Republic, there is a tighter limit of 20%, up to which additional services can be awarded to the original contractor in the negotiation procedure without notice.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This limit is often exceeded,
Since the scope of services for public contracts is often insufficiently determined.
If the excess exceeds 20%, the additional services must be advertised with public notice.
By dividing services into lots, restrictions on competition and the resulting adverse effects can be avoided.
Setting the type of contract and taking into account the EU threshold
By specifying the type of contract, the client determines the number of companies participating in the competition.
It can leave the circle of potential candidates and bidders largely unrestricted, for example, by choosing an open procedure or by imposing non-public tendering procedures.
For construction projects that meet or exceed a threshold set by the EU, Europe-wide tendering procedures must be applied.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
When choosing the type of contract, the contracting authority has to take into account, in particular, European bids for competition and transparency.
If the estimated total contract value of the construction services of a project is at or above the EU threshold of currently 5,000,000 Euros, construction services are to be awarded in principle throughout Europe according to open or non-open procedures.
In exceptional cases, negotiation procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.
The contracting authority may, to a limited extent, deviate from the principle of Europe-wide contracting in construction projects that reach or exceed the EU threshold and award construction services in national contracts, provided that the estimated contract value of the respective lot is less than 1,000,000 euros and the sum of these lots does not exceed 20% of the estimated total contract value of all construction contracts.
A single construction project must not be divided into individual measures without any compelling reason or consciously valued at too low cost values, in order to deprive it of the obligation to award construction services across Europe in principle.
Since restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of the method of award is of great importance in the prevention of corruption.
The detailed reasoning of the chosen award method as well as the examination of the obligation to apply the EU procurement regulations are important components of the documentation of the award procedure.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed the EU legal requirements on tendering procedures and the threshold into national law.
Divergent regulations
The Czech Republic has also transferred the fundamental equivalence of open and non-open procedures contained in the EU directive to its construction contracts, which are not subject to EU requirements.
There is freedom of choice between the open and the not open procedure, without the decision being documented or substantiated, whereas other procedures are only possible according to certain legally defined conditions.
In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure, or - in the case of national contracts - the public tender procedure, which is determined by budgetary and public procurement law as well as by the guidelines for the prevention of corruption, has priority.
Other types of tenders - such as the non-open procedure or the limited tender - are only possible in exceptional cases, which are finally regulated in public procurement law.
The existence of an exceptional case must be substantiated and documented.
The principle of the primacy of the open procedure or public tender is intended to ensure that competition is as unrestricted as possible, to exclude the possibility of manipulation by setting certain bidders and to make it more difficult for bidders to agree on prices.
The principle of public tendering is a central element in preventing corruption in Germany.
The correct estimation of the expected contract value is an essential basis for choosing the right type of contract.
The construction authorities in Germany can rely on planning and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations to determine the expected costs in the area of public construction.
These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects. Among other things, the databases contain cost specifications for building categories, use units, building elements or individual construction services.
On the basis of such cost parameters, the expected order value of a planned plan or a construction output to be awarded can be determined.
In Germany, only a few building services have corresponding cost databases for road construction.
However, a nationwide introduction for all road construction administrations is planned.
Contracting agencies in the Czech Republic cannot rely on central databases or average price estimates of comparable construction measures to determine the likely cost of construction services.
In most cases, the cost assessment is based on estimates by the financing authority or results from the amount of funds made available to the building services.
Measures to standardise cost assessment procedures are still in their infancy.
As part of the anti-corruption plan for 2011-2012, the competent ministries were given the task of creating a database of standardised building materials and materials.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The purpose of this database is to collect information on material costs and on construction and construction works, as well as other cost-relevant data, in order to enable the calculation of costs and the determination of unit prices.
For better cost control, the Czech Ministry of Transport has also published a data collection for construction projects,
Which is to be used as a benchmark in price fixing in the financing plan and is currently being updated.
Essential test results BRH
Selection of the award procedure
The audited contracting bodies largely wrote out the construction services in an open procedure or in public tender and thus complied with budgetary and public procurement regulations.
In 2011, 59.5% of the building services of the federal government were advertised in public or open procedures.
In road construction, this figure was 94.8%.
In the choice of non-public tenders, there was a partial lack of substantiation as to why the awarding bodies had to deviate from the principle of open procedure or public tendering.
In a cross-sectional investigation, based on more than 16,000 tendering procedures, the BRH found that non-public tendering methods have significant disadvantages in terms of competition compared to open procedures and public tenders, and increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.
In the construction sector, more than twice as many bids were submitted in public tenders as in limited tenders and almost three times as many bids as in open-ended tenders.
The study also showed that the average bid price for limited tenders and freehold contracts was 6% and 10% higher, respectively, than for public tenders.
Parallel investigations by the Federal Ministry of Building and the National Audit Office confirmed the economic differences between public and non-public contracts.
As a result of its investigations into economic efficiency, the Federal Ministry of Building even found twice as many differences between public and non-public tendering procedures.
Taking into account the EU threshold
In the case of the construction projects, for which they had determined a probable total order sum of more than 5,000,000 Euros, the inspected contracting bodies usually set out plans in which the construction services to be awarded according to EU and national tendering procedures were determined.
According to the award plans, a share of more than 80% of the construction work was to be awarded throughout the EU.
It was not possible to determine how to avoid the obligation to award EU-wide contracts by means of cost estimates that were too low.
However, it was partly due to erroneous calculations that the minimum share of EU-wide tendering procedures fell below the actual figure.
During construction, some contracting agencies improperly altered the specifications of their procurement plans.
They did not justify these changes and did not prove that the minimum level of EU-wide tendering procedures was still being observed.
For most of the audited construction measures, the share of EU-wide contracts according to the settlement results was usually lower than planned under the award plan.
In some cases, the contracting bodies breached the requirement to tender all 1,000,000 euros and more in comprehensive individual cases in EU-wide proceedings for projects above the EU threshold.
And chose national procedures instead.
NK
Choice of type of contract
For several major construction projects, such as the construction of some sections of the motorway, construction projects in the context of a major sports event and housing projects, the contracting bodies divided construction services into several sub-contracts, although these services were similar or comparable.
Due to these divisions, the individual services were no longer above the threshold and were subsequently awarded in simplified procedures or even in defiance of legal requirements.
Calculation methods for the estimated order value
In the field of road construction, the price databases available for this area were only an insufficient instrument for determining the expected order values.
The data were based on recently completed construction projects, where there were, however, indications of a lack of economic efficiency, unnecessary additional expenditure on services or excessive profits of the contracted companies.
For three sections of a motorway ring, the actual prices were about 37% below the probable order values determined by means of the database.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Transport revised the databases in order to be able to take into account not only the supply prices of recent years, but also comparable market prices and price growth indices in the construction sector.
In the construction, the prospective contract values were based on estimates of costs estimated by the project architects or on estimates by investors.
The actual order values differed sharply from the estimates.
The estimated price for the conversion or expansion of a large library was twice as high as the contract value agreed later, but eight additions in the course of construction resulted in an increase in costs of 2.1 million euros and 27% respectively.
Similarly, the actual contract value for the construction of a library depot was 33% lower than the estimate price, with cost increases in the construction phase.
In other cases, supply prices exceeded estimates and increased during construction.
In the case of the construction of a large library, the estimated price was exceeded by 16 million euros, or 22%. In the case of the construction of a judicial building, the costs rose disproportionately by 139%, since the usable space had expanded by only 12%.
Summary findings
Both countries have transposed the EU regulations on the definition of the type of contract and on taking into account the EU threshold into national law. Therefore, the respective regulations are largely in line.
However, the priority of the open procedure or public tender in Germany goes beyond the EU requirements and the regulations in force in the Czech Republic.
In comparison with non-public procurement procedures, more companies have the opportunity to participate in the competition in public procedures or public tenders.
The public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of bids and the most economical results.
The risk of corruption is greatly improved by the fact that the applicant field is not limited by manipulative requirements of the client and that price agreements between the bidders are made more difficult.
The investigations have confirmed the advantage of the priority of the open procedure or public tender in Germany.
According to Czech legislation, contracting authorities can award contracts in an open or non-open procedure.
Following the latest changes in public procurement law, the number of bidders may no longer be limited in proceedings with previous competition.
Thus, the non-open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.
In Germany, the awarding bodies have largely complied with the requirements for the priority of the open procedure or public tender. In the Czech Republic, some services have been unlawfully distributed in order to avoid the requirements for the selection of the award method.
When considering the EU threshold, errors had to be detected in Germany, which resulted in a fall below the minimum proportion of benefits advertised throughout the EU.
In the Czech Republic, there is still no satisfactory solution for determining the probable costs of construction services and construction projects.
The building services should ensure, if necessary, through further controls, that the requirements for the selection of the type of contract and the scope of services to be advertised throughout Europe are complied with, or that the conditions for determining the true costs are created.
Advance Information and Notice
In the case of construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe, the public builder must inform interested companies of the planned contracts in advance of the tender.
Preliminary information and announcements form an important basis for Europe-wide competition.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
The preliminary information should contain the essential information on the planned construction projects in accordance with public procurement law.
They are required for construction projects where the estimated total contract value exceeds or exceeds the EU threshold and where the client wants to shorten the offer periods of open or non-open procedures.
In notices, the client must provide details of the planned construction contracts to be awarded throughout Europe.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Among other things, it has to make known the scope of services, the procedure and execution dates, the special requirements as well as the evaluation criteria and their weighting.
When describing the subject of the order, the common procurement vocabulary (CPV codes) should be used in a uniform manner throughout Europe.
Preliminary information and announcements will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the procurement profile of the client.
In order to prevent discrimination against foreign interested parties, announcements at the national level must not contain additional information and must only be issued to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union once the notice has been sent.
Incomplete or incorrect information in the notice may adversely affect competition and may even support manipulation.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed the EU legal requirements for pre-information and publicity into national law.
Divergent regulations
In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and announcements are also to be published for construction services not to be awarded throughout Europe.
Tendering procedures may not begin until one month after the sending of the pre-information to the EU Official Journal (for EU-wide contracts) or to the national Official Journal (for all contracts).
Only in exceptional cases can the publication of pre-information be avoided.
In Germany, the non-EU tendering procedures do not require advance information.
In the national tendering procedures, announcements for public tenders and participation competitions must be published on the Internet portal of the Federal Government and, if necessary, in newspapers or journals.
For restricted tenders without competition, notices of services to be awarded from 25,000 euros are required (ex ante transparency).
All planned lots of the construction projects must be listed in the preliminary information.
In Germany, this is particularly important because of the small size of the construction contracts.
In the Czech Republic, the impact of the scheme is limited, as much less construction work is divided into lots.
Essential exam results
BRH
Preliminary information
The surveyed contracting bodies published preliminary information on all audited construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe.
In some open procedures, however, they reduced the offer period, although the 52-day period required between the dispatches of the preliminary information and the announcements had not yet expired.
Other shortened procedures were only tendered after the 12-month period of validity of the pre-information had already expired and before it had been extended.
In the case of many published preliminary information, there was no indication of the planned division of construction services into lots.
Announcements
The announcements of the audited bodies contained some CPV codes, which deviated from the information provided in the preliminary information or which did not cover the required services in an appropriate manner.
In individual cases, announcements at national level were published earlier or contained more information - such as implementation deadlines - than announcements in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Ex ante transparency
The contracting bodies of an audited building administration had commissioned a service company to publish the national tendering procedures.
The company published the notices on its own chargeable contracting platform.
However, the contracting bodies did not check whether the company had forwarded the messages to the federal government's free internet portal as required.
Spot checks showed that only a third of the reports of the audited administration were published on this portal.
NK
Announcements
During the construction of a wastewater treatment plant, the awarding authority did not specify in its notice the criteria on which it wanted to select the bidders.
The awarding authority could not prove how the bidders were selected.
The restriction of the number of bidders was permitted under the law in force at the time.
In the case of the construction of a motorway ring, in a non-open procedure, the awarding authority did not specify in the announcement or in the documentation of the award procedure, according to which it would evaluate the qualifications of the candidates and how many candidates it wanted to admit to the competition.
The award body came to the conclusion in its assessment that all six candidates complied with the qualification requirements, but excluded the candidate with the worst ratings from the further procedure.
The procedure of the awarding authority was not transparent because it did not disclose any information on the qualification criteria and the evaluation procedure at the time of the procedure.
Publication of announcements
During the refurbishment of the former military site, the tender office did not publish the tender.
Summary findings
The two-stage information system with pre-information and publicity is an important element in order to implement the transparency requirement for Europe-wide awards, strengthen competition and thus also prevent corruption.
Both countries have implemented the EU requirements and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures in the national procurement sector:
Selection of candidates for non-public contracts
In contrast to the public procurement procedures, in the non-public procurement procedures, not every company interested in the performance of the services to be awarded can participate in the competition.
In the case of non-public tendering procedures, the awarding authority must make a preliminary selection of which companies are to be invited to submit bids.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption The EU rules allow a limitation of the number of candidates in the EU-wide non-public procurement procedures.
However, in the case of non-open procedures, at least five companies are required to submit bids.
At least three companies are to be invited to negotiate with tenders.
In any case, the number of invited candidates must be sufficiently high to guarantee genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be disclosed beforehand.
The selection of companies to be required is a process within the tendering procedure, which is highly vulnerable to manipulation, for example by giving preference to certain companies.
In addition, limiting competition to a few companies also favours possible agreements between applicants.
In both cases, the result can be significantly affected at the expense of the client.
The awarding bodies must therefore take special precautions against possible manipulation, carry out sufficient checks and, in particular, ensure the transparency and traceability of this process.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
The rules for selecting candidates are similar in both countries.
In addition to the EU requirements, the awarding bodies should switch among the companies to be required as frequently as possible when selecting the candidates.
Nor must competition be limited to companies based in certain regions.
The awarding bodies have to justify the selection of the candidates and document the process of the selection procedure in their award notices.
Divergent regulations
In Germany, in the case of limited tenders, at least three and in the case of open-ended contracts, several suitable candidates are to be invited to submit bids.
According to the new Czech regulations, apart from two special areas, it is illegal to restrict the number of bidders for non-open procedures and negotiation procedures.
In Germany, the multi-eyes principle must be observed when selecting companies.
For example, if an employee has proposed a number of companies for a non-public tendering procedure, the management level of the construction agency or a contractor from the tendering body will usually have to amend this proposal by taking out a proposed company and / or adding a new company.
The aim is to prevent a single person from being able to determine the final circle of companies to be involved in the competition.
Otherwise, in the case of manipulative intentions, this could allow for wide-ranging collusion between the parties.
The list of companies to be required must be kept confidential - also for freelancers - and not made generally accessible.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In the Czech Republic, there are no regulations to establish and keep the names of candidates secret.
According to the German regulations, freelancers are not allowed to determine the companies to be charged, but can only submit proposals to the contracting authority.
There is a loophole in Czech legislation in this area.
Essential exam results
BRH
Number of candidates
The requirement to require a minimum number of companies to submit bids for non-public contracts has been met, except for a few exceptions.
An analysis of the BRH of almost 7,000 non-European-wide tendering procedures for construction services in the construction sector showed that the contracting bodies were asking on average 6.6 for limited tenders from the federal government in Germany and 4.4 for freehold contracts on average for companies to tender.
Change of companies and regional restrictions
In particular, in the case of trades with few suppliers, the contracting agencies did not always change the circle of selected applicants.
Above all, they took into account companies already known to them and proven from their point of view.
As a reason for this, they said they had to ensure the suitability of the companies to compete in non-public proceedings even before they were invited to submit an offer.
The BRH did not establish an inadmissible restriction to regional bidders in the non-public tendering procedures, but rather a higher proportion of regional companies than in public tenders.
The award authorities attributed this mainly to the fact that the scope of services in non-public procurement procedures is significantly lower on average and therefore, for example, longer routes are more important than in public tenders.
More-Eye Principle and Proposals for freelancers
Contrary to the regulations, the contracting bodies have largely omitted to have the proposed list of companies to be modified by an independent person.
They justified this in particular by the lack of processing capacity, time pressure or insufficient knowledge of alternative suitable companies.
It was often not documented who had proposed the companies required to submit offers.
From some samples it emerged that freelancers had drawn up the candidate lists and these proposals had been accepted unchanged by the awarding bodies.
Thus, the awarding bodies did not protect themselves against possible manipulations to the extent required.
Confidential treatment of bidders
At a contracting agency, the lists of the companies to be required were recorded in a data processing system, which could be viewed by all employees of that service.
In the case of manipulative intentions, the names of the designated or approved companies could have been passed on unauthorized and could, for example, allow for collusion among these companies.
Documentation
The documentation of the award procedures only contained justifications for the selection of candidates in a few cases.
NK
Selection of candidates
When building a motorway ring, the bidders did not receive information on the evaluation criteria and the evaluation procedures.
In the case of the non-open procedures for the development and modernisation of waterways and ports, the announcements did not specify how the selection of candidates should be carried out.
In one procedure, all eight participating candidates met the qualification requirements, which exceeded the maximum number of companies to be admitted.
The award committee then carried out a ballot procedure to select the companies.
However, this procedure, which was generally acceptable at the time, should have been mentioned as one of the criteria in the notice.
Summary findings
Due to the high risk of manipulation of the selection of candidates in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special precautions to prevent undue restrictions on competition.
With the more-eyes principle, the secrecy of the bidding lists and the sole authority of the contracting bodies to propose the companies to be required, the German regulations restrict such abuse possibilities.
In the case of Czech regulations, the newly introduced requirement of the largely unlimited number of bidders in non-public proceedings can, above all, counteract possible manipulative restrictions.
However, the audit findings have shown that some of these requirements have been inadequately implemented and that the potential for manipulating an abusive restriction of the participant field has not been sufficiently reduced in these cases.
The contracting authorities should completely eliminate the deficits that have been identified.
Bid phase
With the announcement of the award or the invitation to tender, the tender phase begins, in which the companies can make bids on the basis of the tendering documents sent to them.
Applicants can submit their bids until the tender period set by the awarding authority expires.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
There are no separate EU legal requirements for this phase of the tendering procedure.
The awarding bodies have to observe the national regulations, which are intended to counteract the possibilities of manipulation existing during the bid phase.
These are mainly organisational requirements and controls.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
The tender documents, on the basis of which the companies are to prepare their bids, are to be sent in principle only by the contracting authority.
Freelancers involved in the award procedure are not allowed to perform this task.
The awarding authority must ensure that all applicants receive the same information during the bidding phase.
In the event of confusion on the award documents or other questions concerning the tender procedure, only the awarding authority may provide information to the candidates.
Freelancers commissioned with the production of the award documents are not allowed to provide information.
During the entire offer phase, contact between the commissioned freelancers and the applicants must be prevented.
Freelancers must not become a hub of the tendering process, through which contacts can be established with anti-competitive consequences.
Bids sent by post or direct must be submitted in a closed envelope.
Offers sent electronically have a technical encryption.

In Germany, the contracting authority can also commission external service companies to print and send the tender documents, whose employees are obliged to maintain the confidentiality of the offers and to conscientiously fulfil the contractual obligations.
The offers received must be marked with an entrance stamp in Germany and must be sent immediately, immediately and unopened to an employee responsible for custody.
This employee may not be involved in the award.
The offers received must be kept under wraps until the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, the offers received are marked with a reference number.
The awarding authority records the bid data, including order numbers, as well as the production and entry data in a protocol.
Custody of the offers is not regulated in the Czech Republic.
Essential exam results
BRH
The tests for the tender phase focused mainly on the tendering procedures of a construction administration.
Dispatch of the award documents
The contracting offices of the inspected building administration sent the tendering documents themselves or had them printed and sent by an external service company.
Freelancers did not send out tendering documents.
Information to candidates
For the most part, the inspected building administration did not comply with the requirements for separating planning and contracting when naming the contact persons for questions and information.
Contrary to the specifications, she did not specify employees from the contracting authority in the service descriptions, but from the project managers as contact persons.
Some tendering documents even contained the names of freelancers who had drawn up the service descriptions.
In individual cases, not all applicants received the same information when making enquiries during the bid phase.
Labelling of offers
In the case of the approved building administration, all offers received were provided with an entrance stamp and an entrance note.
For some freelance contracts, however, the offers were received by freelancers, which contradicted the preconditions for preventing corruption.
Keeping the offers
Following their identification, not all offers immediately and immediately reached the employee responsible for custody, who included the offers in a steel cabinet.
In the meantime, the offers were placed in an open section of the post office, to which every employee had access.
Another office had hung a mailbox in a hallway that was not constantly monitored, and some of the offers received there remained overnight.
Since the entry slot of this mailbox was large and unsecured, not only employees, but also visitors to the office would have had the opportunity to remove received offers and, if necessary, to manipulate them.
NK
There were no complaints on the Czech side.
Summary findings
During the tender phase, contacts between interested companies and professionals involved in the tendering process are to be prevented in both countries.
In addition, by providing all bidders with the same information, the principle of equal treatment should be respected.
The rules on the receipt, custody and confidentiality of the offers seem appropriate to counteract manipulation and corruption.
The corresponding requirements in Germany are somewhat more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
The results of the investigation in Germany have revealed violations of the regulations in some areas.
These shortcomings could be rectified with little effort.
Opening of offers
Opening of offers
During the opening date, the previously closed offers will be opened and their contents read and thus made known.
From the opening date, bidders will be bound to their bids until the expiration of the award period set by the awarding authority.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
There are no specific EU regulations for the opening up of bids.
However, the national regulations for the prevention of corruption contain extensive requirements for the protection of bids and competition for this highly sensitive phase of the tendering procedure.
The multi-eye principle and the transparency and traceability of the offer opening are intended to prevent manipulation and alteration of the submitted offers.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
The opening date must be carried out by several persons to be determined by the awarding authority.
The multi-eye principle is intended to prevent individuals from being able to manipulate the offers in an uncontrolled manner when opening the offers.
In most tendering procedures, bidders can attend the opening date.
Only offers are accepted for the opening, which were submitted to the head of the negotiations when the first bid was opened.
In principle, offers received late may no longer be considered.
In order to ensure the transparency of the opening date, the actions taken and the results of the opening of the bid must be set out in a protocol in which, among other things, the names of the bidders and the bid prices must be recorded.
The minutes are to be read and signed by the negotiators.
It can also be signed by the bidders present.
Divergent regulations
In the Czech Republic, a committee is conducting the opening of the bids.
Freelancers can also play a part in this.
The committee can also be tasked with other phases of the tendering process, such as the evaluation of the bids.
In Germany, a chief negotiator and a secretary are carrying out the bid opening.
The chief negotiator must be an employee of the tendering body.
The head of the negotiations and, in the case of contracts in the building, also the secretary are not to be involved in the processing of the award documents, as well as in the awarding and execution of contracts.
In the minutes of the opening date, according to the German regulations, in addition to the offer prices, information about discounts and discounts as well as special features - such as damaged or delayed offers - must be recorded.
In the Czech Republic, apart from the offer price, only the language of the offer and the signature authority of the applicant are recorded.
The German regulations stipulate that the open offers must be marked in all parts in such a way that subsequent modifications and additions are prevented.
The offers are usually marked by perforations with the date of the opening date. They are to be kept secret after the opening date and may only be made available to persons directly responsible for the processing.
Czech regulations do not exist.
If a tender procedure in the Czech Republic involves only one bid, it must not be opened and must not be sent back.
There is no such regulation in Germany. If there is only one offer, it has to be opened and then evaluated.
Essential exam results
BRH
More-eye principle
The audited awarding bodies implemented the requirements for the multi-eye principle at the opening dates.
They carried out the opening sessions with negotiators and writers, who were not responsible for any other awards.
However, in the case of freehold awards of a smaller scope, there have been occasional cases in which freelancers have opened offers sent to them without the involvement of the contracting authority.
Protocol
In the minutes of the opening dates, the opening of the offers was not always fully documented.
In some cases, for example, the late-filed offers were not registered; in some cases, signatures were even missing.
Labelling of offers
The contracting bodies examined in the context of the cross-sectional inspection identified the offers according to the specifications by a perforation with the date of the opening date.
In the case of longer-term audits of some beneficiaries, insufficient markings had been identified.
However, these contracting bodies changed their labelling practice after the complaint by the BRH.
NK
Offer period
In the case of the award of road maintenance measures, an offer was received only one month after the expiration of the tender period at the awarding authority, which nevertheless accepted the offer.
Summary findings
The regulations of both countries for the opening of the offers coincide in significant parts. They take into account both the principle of multi-eyes and the principle of transparency. This means that the risks of corruption and manipulation can be substantially limited when the offers are opened up.
The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
In particular, the requirements for the exact documentation of the procedure as well as for the marking, the safe storage and the confidentiality of the offers significantly restrict the possibilities for manipulation, such as subsequent modifications of the offers.
In addition, those charged with the opening of the offers may not perform other tasks in connection with the performance to be awarded.
The total of only a few complaints show the high acceptance of the requirements for the opening of the bid.
Review and evaluation of the offers
Review and evaluation of the offers The client has to examine and evaluate the offers that are available at the opening date.
He has to determine the offer for the award of the award, which corresponds best to the requirements according to the given award criteria.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
The EU guidelines provide for a multi-level procedure:
First of all, the suitability of the bidders must be established.
Bidders must be economically and financially efficient and have the necessary professional and technical expertise.
In principle, companies that have been convicted of, for example, bribery or fraud are to be excluded from participating in the award procedure.
The bids of the not excluded bidders are to be examined in terms of calculation, technology and economics and evaluated on the basis of the award criteria previously announced.
The client has to determine the most economical offer. Offers with unusually low prices have to be examined by the client in particular.
The review and evaluation of the bids is a particularly tamper-prone phase of the award procedure.
For example, bidders can be unjustly excluded or offers that do not meet the requirements can be left in the competition.
By favouring or discriminating against bidders, the result can be unacceptably impaired and thus the establishment of the most economically advantageous offer can be prevented.
The awarding authority must therefore take special precautions to ensure that the persons charged with the examination and evaluation meet the requirements for integrity and expertise.
It must also ensure the transparency and traceability of the procedure and the decisions taken.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
In accordance with the requirements of the EU, offers in both countries must be examined and evaluated in a multi-stage procedure.
The requirements for the proof of suitability of the companies to be submitted as well as the award criteria to be taken into account in the evaluation and their weighting are specified in the notices or in the award documents and can no longer be changed during the procedure.
After testing the suitability of the bidding, the suitability criteria may no longer be used in the evaluation of the bids.
The rating has to be limited to the award criteria.
The submitted bids must first be formally examined immediately to see if they are complete and if they contain, for example, abnormalities that could indicate possible manipulation intentions.
If bidders are excluded from further consideration and evaluation of their bids, they must be informed of this without delay.
If the valuation of the bids results in an unreasonably low price, the bidder must be given an opportunity to comment before a possible exclusion of his bid.
The decisions taken during the examination and evaluation of the offers are to be documented in a comprehensible manner.
Divergent regulations
In Germany, the offers to be kept secret may only be made available to those directly responsible for processing them.
The review of the offers as well as the calculation of the bids may only be carried out by the awarding authority.
It has only to employ staff who are not involved in the award decision or the implementation of the measure.
The performance of further examination and evaluation tasks is not regulated.
If freelancers are charged with checking and valuing, they must treat the offers in confidence.
They may only make proposals for the decisions to be made by the awarding bodies.
In the Czech Republic, procurement committees are to be set up to examine and evaluate the bids.
The committees draw up evaluation reports with proposals for awarding contracts.
Ultimately, as in Germany, only the contracting authorities have to decide on the contracts awarded.
If evidence or declarations required for the submission of bids in Germany are not submitted in full, the awarding authority has to give the bidders the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.
Only if the documents are still not available after the expiration of the deadline is the offer excluded from the valuation.
In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the awarding authority whether to give bidders the opportunity to complete missing evidence or declarations.
If a bidder fails to do this, he must be excluded.
In Germany, apart from the total price, the unit prices (prices for partial services) of the offers must also be investigated.
If, due to the price structure of the offer, there are indications that the prices for partial services are too low or too high, the bidder must be asked to remove these ambiguities.
If he fails to do so and if the awarding authority can prove that the prices are calculated in a mixed manner, this offer must be excluded.
The aim is to prevent bidders from speculating on significant changes in the volume of partial services when calculating their bid, which can result in significant increases in the cost of the construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, the total price is assessed, but not the adequacy of the prices for partial services.
A mix calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.
In Germany, a surcharge may not be imposed on offers with unreasonably high or low prices.
If one or more bids fall short of the true price determination of the client or the bid sums of the remaining bidders by 10% or more, the bidders must prove the correct calculation of their bids.
If this is not possible for them, the awarding authority can exclude the relevant offers.
In the Czech Republic, the tender can be cancelled after checking the economic efficiency, if only offers with unjustifiable at low prices are available.
In contrast to German public procurement law, the surcharge for offers with prices substantially higher than those of the client cannot be refused for this reason.
If there are suspicions of anti-competitive behaviour in Germany, the awarding authority must immediately report to its technical supervision at the leading level.
It has to decide what measures to take and whether to inform the antitrust authority or the public prosecutor.
For example, the professional supervision at the leading level must also agree to construction work of more than 50,000 euros if the contract is to be awarded by hand, if the bid is not to be awarded at the lowest price or if the tender is to be cancelled.
There are no regulations in the Czech Republic.
Essential exam results
BRH
Suitability and rating criteria
The vast majority of tested tendering procedures complied with the requirements set out above.
For some companies proposed by freelancers, the contracting bodies did not check the suitability of the companies themselves.
A grant recipient commissioned the company without the required proof of suitability being complete.
In some proceedings, it was not clear whether the awarding authority had taken into account all known award criteria in its selection decision or whether it had merely based its award decision on the "price" criterion.
Selection of the people involved and confidentiality of the offers
Some awarding bodies used unauthorised persons to check the offers.
For example, freelancers or employees of the department involved in the planning or execution of a construction project carried out tasks that could only be performed by employees of the contracting office.
The construction services justified this with insufficient personnel capacity in the respective areas.
In some cases, the freelancers charged with examining the offers also assisted employees who were not obliged to maintain the confidentiality of the offers and to conscientiously fulfil the contractual obligations.
For the construction services, it was usually not clear whether the offers for freelancers were only available to those directly responsible for the work.
Inspection and computational verification of offers
Some awarding bodies passed on the open offers to freelancers for further examination, without having previously carried out the prescribed review of the offers and the computational examination themselves and having documented their results.
In the case of manipulative intentions, third parties could have made changes to the offers without the contracting bodies being able to understand this.
In the documents checked, some conspicuous or missing price or product information were not or only inadequately marked.
Performance audits
For a sample in a building administration, the most favourable offers in three quarters of the tested tendering procedures deviated more than 10% from the estimate costs previously determined.
Each twentieth award procedure was cancelled due to inappropriate bid prices.
Not all of the bidders were able to understand or sufficiently document their bid tests and discussions with bidders.
In many cases, there is a lack of more detailed information, such as on the unit prices of the most important positions.
Frequently, the deviations were only justified in general terms, for example by indications of changed market prices or increased material costs.
The building authorities explained that the detection and detection of mixed calculations is difficult.
In the case of an invitation to tender from an institution under public law, the offer price of the most advantageous offer was 66% below the previously determined estimate value of these services.
Closer calculations or investigations into the causes of this deviation have not been documented.
In a briefing, the awarding authority found no evidence of price dumping by the then contracted company.
This left it unclear whether the estimated value was excessive or whether the offer price was too low.
Later, the client assessed the contracted company as a "low-cost company" that could not maintain quality or deadlines.
In another call for tender, a building services authority awarded the bid, the price of which was 35% higher than the value of the cost assessment.
It did not cancel the call for tender, citing the non-factual reason that an adequate calculation could be concluded for this company.
Suspected irregularities
There were two cases of irregularities in the audited building administration, both of which were reported to the leading authority.
In one of the cases, the calculation of two bidders was identical in a call for tenders, so that the awarding authority excluded both bids from the procedure.
In the application of the other regulations, the tests did not reveal any substantial complaints.
NK
Aptitude test
For many of the approved construction projects, including university construction, road construction and the extension of the rail network, the awarding bodies did not exclude bidders from the procedure, even though they did not meet the requirements specified in the tender documents or could not prove their suitability to the extent required. On the other hand, a tendering body could neither prove nor explain why it had excluded a bidder who had complied with the requirements.
Rating
When awarding construction services for a water treatment plant, the awarding authority omitted the given evaluation criteria when considering and valuing the bids.
In a construction project for the extension of the railway network, the awarding authority determined the weighting of the evaluation criteria only at the beginning of the evaluation.
In the case of road maintenance measures, the given criterion of "shortening the construction phase" was incorrectly evaluated in a procedure.
As a result, the bidders in second and third place did not take sufficient account of the shortfall offered.
Documentation of the selection
In three tendering procedures for housing development, the tendering body did not document the criteria it applied and the basis on which it had selected the successful bidder.
During the construction of a motorway, the contracting authority chose the companies for smaller contracts up to 20,000 Euros on the basis of telephone surveys of prices and delivery conditions alone.
Examinations of this selection were not possible because the surveys were not documented.
Summary findings
The regulations for examining and evaluating the offers in both countries are in line with the requirements of the EU.
However, the details of the procedure and the selection of the people involved differ from one another.
In Germany, the procedure is more closely regulated than in the Czech Republic due to detailed requirements, in particular regarding the implementation of the multi-eye principle and the protection of the offers.
The same applies to the requirements on the basis of which the adequacy of the offered prices must be examined.
In both countries, it had to be established in some of the tendering procedures examined that substantial steps in the examination and evaluation of the bids had not been or had been inadequately documented.
However, without accountability and transparency of the audit and evaluation decisions, possible manipulative interventions are favoured.
A particularly serious defect was the handing over of all offers to third parties, without the public contracting authority having sufficiently looked through and documented the offers beforehand, thus protecting them against possible manipulation in the further proceedings.
If public authorities have tasks carried out during the examination and evaluation of the offers by third parties, sufficient precautions and an increased control effort are required to respond to the increased risk of manipulation.
When examining the appropriateness of the prices, the audited services in Germany did not always make full use of the specified instruments and did not examine the price structure of the offers sufficiently.
In the Czech Republic there have been complaints, particularly regarding the suitability test and the application of the assessment criteria.
Closure of the award procedure
After examining the value of the bids, the award procedure will be completed by the award of the bid or by the suspension of the procedure.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
In the case of EU-wide tendering procedures, all bidders must be informed in advance of the planned award decision.
The companies have the possibility to check the intended allocation of information by electronic means or by fax within 10 days or by other means of communication within 15 days and, if necessary, to open a review procedure.
A contract may not be concluded before the expiration of this information period.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
If a bidder submits a request for review within the information period, it is only possible to conclude the contract after the final decision in the review procedure.
Companies can also have the award decision reviewed by an independent court as part of this review process.
The review procedure is intended to ensure legal protection for companies and to encourage the contracting authority to observe public procurement law throughout the entire tendering procedure.
To do this, he must sufficiently document the procedure.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
Both countries have implemented the EU rules on information and verification procedures.
In both countries, the awarding authority has to decide on the award of the award.
However, it must not arbitrarily deviate from the result of a proper review and evaluation of the offers.
The client shall place the order within the announced surcharge period,
Also because the bidders are no longer bound to their bids after the deadline.
In the case of open and non-open procedures or public and restricted tenders, the client may not in principle deviate from the content of the offer at the conclusion of the contract.
The underperforming bidders must be informed in a timely manner about the award decision and the reasons for not taking their offers into account.
Tendering procedures may only be cancelled under certain conditions, for example if the bid prices are inflated or the bids do not meet the requirements of the tender.
Divergent regulations
In the Czech Republic, the 10-day or 15-day information and waiting period prior to the award of the contract also applies to construction services not to be awarded throughout Europe.
In Germany, these requirements apply only to the area of EU-wide awards.
In the other proceedings in Germany, bidders can only be informed of the award decision after the award has been awarded.
In the Czech Republic, a tendering procedure has to be cancelled if only one bid has been received or only one bid has been accepted.
In Germany, the award is only to be made in the case of a single, valuable bid, provided that it meets the conditions of the tender and is economical.
Essential exam results
BRH
There were only a few complaints in respect of the tested awards at the conclusion of the award procedures.
In some cases, companies awarded contracts at EU-wide contracts even before the expiration of the information periods, which may result in the contract being ineffective.
According to open procedures, contract letters also contained different content in individual cases, such as amended deadlines.
In several cases, the clients did not meet the surcharge deadlines.
In an open procedure, a tendering authority therefore awarded the contract for the second-cheapest offer, since a company with a 50% cheaper offer was no longer willing to perform the services at the originally offered price after the end of the surcharge period.
NK
In the case of a construction project in the university sector, the awarding authority in the contract deviated from the bidder's offer in terms of content.
For some contracts, for example in the construction of road maintenance, the construction of a motorway and a bypass, the contracting bodies concluded the contracts after the legal deadline.
When awarding construction work for the refurbishment of the former military site, the awarding authority only forwarded the notice of the award to all bidders after the legal deadline.
Summary findings
Both countries have implemented the requirements of the EU at the end of the tendering procedure.
The legal protection of the underperforming candidates or bidders increases the scope of the prevention of corruption.
The scope of legal protection in Czech public procurement law is also extended to contracts below EU thresholds.
In both countries, time limits for placing orders have been exceeded.
This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.
The building services should in future avoid the identified shortcomings in the completion of their tendering procedures.
Documentation, reporting and reporting requirements
The award procedures are to be documented during their individual stages with regard to the relevant findings as well as the justifications of the individual decisions.
For EU-wide procedures, the orders are to be announced.
The order data is also recorded in an EU statistic.
Requirements of EU law as well as the prevention of corruption The documentation of the procurement procedures implements a fundamental requirement of the EU-wide transparency requirement.
Carefully and promptly produced documentation allows for the traceability of the award decisions.
In particular, it also serves the effective legal protection of bidders for contracts above EU thresholds.
Proper documentation is also an essential part of preventing corruption, as the compulsion to justify award decisions in detail significantly limits the scope for manipulation.
The announcement of a contract in an EU-wide tender procedure has to be submitted to the Office for Official Publications of the EU within 48 days.
The Office publishes the notices in the Official Journal of the EU and thus implements the transparency requirement.
The contracting bodies must also collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and report it to the competent national ministries of the European Commission.
On this basis, the European Commission produces an annual EU statistic, which enables it to gain an overview of the development of the internal market in construction services.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed the EU legal requirements for documentation and reporting requirements into national law.
The rules on documentation and reporting for EU statistics are largely the same in both countries.
Divergent regulations
In the Czech Republic, the obligation to publish awarded contracts is not limited to EU-wide contracts, but also extends to the other tendering procedures.
The notice period is reduced to 15 days.
In Germany, in addition to EU-wide awards, there is a publication obligation only for limited tenders and for freehold contracts with a value limit of 25,000 euros or 15,000 euros without VAT (so-called ex post transparency).
Under these limits and in the case of public tenders, only the companies taking part in the competition procedure will receive information about the contracts awarded.
Essential exam results
BRH
Documentation
A large number of the tested tendering procedures were not fully documented.
The award notices did not contain all the necessary information, such as the justification of product specifications or references to national regulations.
In a tendering procedure, the awarding authority did not explain why it awarded the contract to a company, even though its offer did not contain compelling evidence.
In a few cases, the documents of the awarding authorities did not contain all the evidence required for the documentation of the award procedure.
Announcements on contracts
In some EU-wide tendering procedures, the contracting authorities failed to disclose the award of the contracts.
In the case of further tendering procedures, there was a lack of evidence that the contracting authorities had disclosed the contracts awarded.
Reporting and reporting obligations
The statistics that were viewed contained the minimum required information. They had been drawn up and sent on time.
Ex-post transparency
In most cases, the audited building services published the contract data of the completed tendering procedures.
However, a construction administration failed to publish the data due to a transmission error.
The building administration only noticed this error after half a year,
So that the contract data of the tendering procedures completed up to then were not published.
NK
Documentation
The documentation of the award procedures showed considerable shortcomings in construction measures for the organisation of a major sporting event, mainly in the case of incorrect information, such as incorrect bid prices in the minutes of the evaluation commissions.
In addition, some minutes of the bid openings were not signed.
Announcements on contracts
For several road construction projects, announcements of contracts awarded have been delayed or not published at all.
Summary findings
The regulations on documentation and the reporting and reporting requirements in both countries are broadly in line with each other and implement the EU guidelines.
In principle, this ensures the transparency of the procurement procedures, including the award of contracts.
The regulations to be applied for publication in the Czech Republic go a little further than the requirements in Germany.
The flaws identified in the documentation and in the notices significantly limited the anti-corruption effect of these instruments in the respective procurement procedures.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The building services should further improve the transparency of their tendering procedures and contracts and fully comply with their reporting and reporting obligations.
Summary evaluation and recommendations
The parallel tests of the NK and the BRH have focused on two main areas, which in the Czech Republic and in Germany are essential for the award of construction services by public authorities: The application of EU procurement regulations and the prevention of corruption.
The requirements of EU law enable cross-border competition to create a single European market.
Anti-corruption measures are not only designed to prevent or at least reduce corruption, but also to avert economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the state.
The audit findings of the two courts of auditors on the application of the public procurement regulations in both countries, as well as the comparison of these regulations, provide conclusions on similarities and differences that can be helpful for both countries in the further development of their public procurement law and its application.
Application of EU public procurement rules
The EU requirements for the award of construction services have been transposed into national law by both countries.
Thus, in the Czech Republic and Germany, there is an important common basis for the award of construction services and the consideration of the essential bids of the competition, the equal treatment of the companies involved and the transparency of the tendering procedures.
The building services of both countries have in some cases very extensively supported these bids by further administrative regulations.
To a large extent, the Czech Republic has also applied the requirements of the construction contracts to its nationally regulated tendering procedures below the EU threshold.
However, investigations by the Court of Auditors have shown that the building services have not fully complied with the requirements of EU law in all areas.
The building administration in Germany should further improve the quality of its tendering procedures in order to be able to remove the complaints identified when implementing the EU requirements.
The tests carried out in the Czech Republic have, above all, revealed dangers that affect the efficiency of the contracts.
For example, incomplete descriptions of performance required additional services, which were often awarded in violation of the law. In addition, the cost calculations were mostly inadequately prepared, and excessive qualification requirements reduced the number of possible bidders and, in particular, restricted competition in the construction of roads.
Prevention of corruption
The investigations did not aim to uncover cases of corruption,
Also because the courts of auditors do not have appropriate instruments for this.
However, the courts can check to what extent the administrations of both countries have taken precautions against corruption and manipulation in the award of construction services and how these requirements are applied.
Both countries have set different priorities in the prevention of corruption.
The German regulations foresee, above all, a largely unrestricted competition and transparency and controls as central elements of the prevention of corruption.
The main aim of the Czech regulations is to increase the transparency of procedures.
BRH
In Germany, general principles of prevention of corruption apply, which must be applied by the entire federal administration.
These principles are also implemented in the requirements for the award of construction services and geared towards their specific requirements.
According to the regulations, it is sometimes very clear how the bids for the prevention of corruption are to be taken into account in the course of the tendering procedures and in the selection of the persons involved.
In the opinion of the BRF, in particular, the primacy of the principle of open procedure or public tender is a suitable instrument for substantially reducing the risk of corruption in the award of construction services, while restrictions on competition increase the risk of manipulative interventions.
Risk analysis and sufficient controls (especially the multi-eyes principle), the requirements for transparency and documentation of the award procedures, as well as various organisational measures, are also effective precautions to prevent corruption and manipulation.
The BRH therefore sees no need for change in principle to the corresponding requirements of the administration when awarding construction services.
The rules for preventing corruption are largely taken into account in practice.
The shortcomings identified in some areas have shown shortcomings in the implementation of some requirements.
The building services should continue to train their employees on the requirements for the prevention of corruption and make them even more sensitive to this problem.
A significant part of the complaints related to tasks the building services had delegated to freelancers.
However, without checks and adequate safeguards, the risk of abuse increases when delegating tasks.
Manipulative and corrupt tasks should therefore only be assigned to third parties if the administration can ensure a sufficient level of protection against inadmissible interventions.
NK
At the level of government, the Czech Republic has adopted a strategy against corruption, in which the most important element is the area of public procurement.
The award law and the related implementing provisions have been substantially amended.
The tests of the NK took place during the implementation of this strategy.
The strategy adopted and the new legal provisions should be effective improvement measures, since the awarding bodies must justify the cost-effectiveness of the orders, the calculation of the expected prices, the adequacy of the qualification requirements, the essential evaluation criteria and the type of assessments, and properly document and publish all these aspects.
Recommendations
The NK and the BRH are generally positive about the implementation of the EU guidelines.
The broad acceptance in practice has confirmed that the EU requirements of competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for the award of construction services within the European Union.
The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as a basis for similar projects to enable and promote cross-border competition.
In view of the enormous material and ideal damage caused by manipulation and corruption in the award of construction services, both courts of auditors see the building services in their countries as being called upon to continue and, if necessary, improve their measures against corruption and manipulation.
In particular, the organisation and procedures of tendering procedures should be continuously examined for weaknesses and risks, in order to identify the need for action and to be able to take appropriate countermeasures.
The comparison of procurement practices in both countries suggests that the share of open procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased, as open procedures offer a wider scope for competition and can significantly reduce the risk of corruption.
In addition, a greater division of construction services into lots can have a favourable effect on supply prices, provided that greater competition is achieved with a higher number of bidders.
Ensuring the correct execution of the tendering procedures is an essential basis for efficient contracting of public contracts.
In Germany, the tendering procedures are carried out by the building services specialized in this field, whereas in the Czech Republic, these tasks are carried out - with the exception of the transport projects - by the departments themselves or by the contractors commissioned by them.
After the completion of their joint project, the two countries' courts of auditors will continue to develop the knowledge that is important to them and, if necessary, refer it to the parliament and the government of their country.
In addition, both courts are convinced that the principles of public procurement law set out in this report and its implementation are also of interest at the international level of the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), because the principles and knowledge set out are of general importance in order to combat corruption effectively and to ensure the economic allocation of construction services in a well-functioning and fair competition.

Football: JUVE coach praises Ronaldo's best game after top score
The Portuguese star striker "played the best match this evening together with Valencia for half an hour," praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the record-breaking 3: 1 (1: 1) win against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive star was the decisive man in the important match against the chasing team, even without an own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is doing well," Allegri said.
Even if we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good in our first goal - and from that moment on we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goals, Juve turned the game after the early delay by beating Dries Mertens (10th minute) and, for the time being, hung off the worst of the chasers.
The Real Madrid goalkeeper first set up the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who took the lead with a double (26th / 49th).
And Ronaldo, after a corner by header, also did the preparatory work for the strike from defence boss Leonardo Bonucci (76), who only had to push in short of the goal line.
"He has a lot of ideas," praised the coach.
But Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record goalscorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We have to get even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
The best Juve goalscorer is currently mandzukic with four goals - Ronaldo has three.

Music cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Suitable for adults as well as men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck.

The piano solo is now demonstrating the same thing: What would have come from composing Mozart had "the Nannerl" opened the door unexpectedly?

Management of VAT in the Czech Republic and in the Federal Republic of Germany
Audit report
Preface
Taxes are the main source of revenue for public budgets.
A focus of the activities of the courts of auditors should therefore be on the examination of this area.
This applies in particular to sales tax fraud.
This alone results in annual tax losses of an estimated 100 billion Euro 1 in the European Union.
Already at the 6th EUROSAI Congress in Bonn in 2005, the participants pointed out the need for increased cooperation.
This makes it possible for the audit courts, for example, to exchange audit approaches and optimise audit practice.
VAT is particularly suitable for cooperation, as it is harmonised within the European Union.
In 2006, for the first time, the courts of auditors of both states were conducting parallel audits in the area of the VAT.
The corresponding audit report was published in 2008.
Since the VAT fraud is a widespread phenomenon in the European Union, it requires close cooperation between the courts of auditors, so that it can be fully assessed whether the measures taken are capable of countering the VAT fraud effectively.
The two courts of auditors decided to continue their cooperation and carried out a second parallel audit. Management of the sales tax in the Czech Republic and in the Federal Republic of Germany Report on the audit
1. Introduction
Exam number: (CZ) 09 / 11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892
Subject of examination: (CZ) Administration of the USt (D) Bilateral audit with the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic (hereinafter "NK"), audit
Objective of the examination:
(CZ) the administration of the VAT and the treatment of selected transactions between businessmen of the Czech Republic (hereinafter CZ) and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter Germany) should be examined. In addition, the procedures applied by the tax authorities in the case of inter-governmental administrative assistance should be investigated.
(D) The audit should evaluate how the financial administration has implemented the recommendations made by the auditors.
In addition, other fields of examination - linked to the VAT - should be worked on.
The findings made here should be compared in order to determine whether the taxation procedures can be optimised.
The period of examination was from 2006 to 2008, including relevant information from the period before the examination period to the completion of the exam.
2. Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel examination
The Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have agreed on an audit of the administration of the VAT.
During the previous parallel investigation, they had uncovered suspected cases of intra-Community transactions,
Which made it seem appropriate to take another exam.
On the basis of the audit findings, the two audit courts made recommendations for the administration of the VAT.
The aim of the inspection was to evaluate how these recommendations were implemented and to investigate the suspected cases identified.
The audit also looked at other issues, including selected cases of high-risk intra-Community transactions, mutual assistance in recovering VAT receivables, and the VAT audit of large companies.
The Court of Auditors has found that:
1. Recommendations made on the basis of the previous audit
• Recommendation 1: The rules for registering taxpayers should be harmonised within the EU
In the first audit, the Court of Auditors compared the VAT registration procedures in the two states and found differences that caused problems.
The Court therefore recommended harmonizing the registration of taxpayers within the EU.
This has also been taken up at EU level.
The draft amendment to Council Regulation No 1798 / 2003 provides for the extension of current databases in the EU, including a database with the identification number of persons subject to VAT.
The draft also provided for common rules for the registration of taxpayers and their possible deletion.
The Court of Auditors expected the Member States to agree on appropriate rules to remove unreliable operators from the VAT system as soon as possible, in accordance with its decision of principle.
The Member States reached political agreement in ECOFIN on the final version of the draft.
The above-mentioned common rules are no longer included in it, and the two courts of auditors regret this.
They still consider such regulations important in order to prevent sales tax fraud.
• Recommendation 2: Monthly submission of Comprehensive Notices As a result of the first audit, the Court of Auditors recommended that Member States submit Comprehensive Notices (ZM) on a monthly basis in the future.
The amounts of intra-Community transactions could then be reviewed more closely.
Council Directive 2008 / 117 / EC amending Directive 2006 / 112 / EC on the common system of value added tax for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions has reduced the deadline for the submission of the ZM to one month.
In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by an amendment to the VAT law, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.
In Germany, the implementation did not come into effect until 1 July 2010, which means that the obligation to submit the ZM on a monthly basis has not been transposed into national law on time.
• Recommendation 3: Data comparison of the VAT pre-registration and the ZM in Germany for more reliable MIAS data and proposal to examine the amalgamation of procedures for VAT pre-registration and ZM. The German financial administration has taken up the recommendation made by the Federal Audit Office and set up a working group to work out possible solutions.
The work is not yet complete.
The Federal Audit Office will monitor the further development.
• Recommendation 4: Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level In the course of the first audit, the two courts agreed that an effective risk management system could not be developed by one Member State alone.
Successful criteria and elements or approaches of a risk management system must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State.
If this does not happen, fraudsters will focus on the Member State with the weakest risk management system.
The Court of Auditors found that the two Member States use different risk management systems, which have both strengths and weaknesses.
The NKU reviewed the system of information exchange within the EU - Eurocanet, while the Federal Audit Office focused on German participation in the "Risk Management Platform."
2. Control of selected intra-Community transactions
During the first audit, the courts of auditors had jointly examined transactions in which it was doubtful whether they had actually been carried out or which had been declared differently by the taxpayers of the two States in the VAT pre-applications (or UST declarations) or ZM.
The Court of Auditors selected nine cases of intra-Community goods deliveries between the CZ and Germany for the inspection.
The audits by the tax authorities of both states were not yet completed when the first parallel audit was completed.
The audit showed that the tax procedures for these selected transactions have now been completed, and the respective financial administrations have taken appropriate measures to this end (e.g. subsequent VAT requirements or the prevention of pre-tax refunds).
3. Examination of selected, particularly high-risk intra-Community transactions
Also included in the audit were high-risk intra-EU transactions between taxpayers in the EU covered by the Eurocanet system.
Eurocanet is designed to detect high-risk taxpayers.
Member States can participate in this system on a voluntary basis.
The CZ is an active participant in Eurocanet. Germany has a passive status, i.e. it does not participate in the exchange of data within the framework of Eurocanet.
From the point of view of an active participant state, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to participate actively.
As a result, no information could be obtained on which suppliers with German VAT ID would have been classified as high-risk cases.
The NKU identified normal transactions as well as those suspected of fraud, including carousel fraud, in the selected transactions.
High-risk transactions were only able to be checked to a limited extent, especially in the case of so-called "missing traders," whereby a check of the documents alone is hardly sufficient to prove fraud to the taxable person.
Suspected carousel fraud in imports and exports
It is recommended that the customs and tax authorities work more closely together in order to be able to monitor the integrity of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the end customer.
Germany and a number of other countries have refused to participate actively in Eurocanet, because they do not consider that there is a sufficient legal basis.
The Federal Audit Office found that the German financial administration uses other tools to identify high-risk taxpayers.
However, there is a need for communication and exchange of experience between all EU Member States.
The Council of the EU agreed on a draft regulation,
Created by the EUROFISC.
The experience gained so far with Eurocanet should be incorporated into the planned network for the fight against VAT fraud.
4.Mutual mutual assistance in the recovery of claims
Intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of claims is subject to the same European legislation in all Member States.
That is why requests for intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of claims in the CZ and Germany are being dealt with in the same way.
The Federal Audit Office and NKU compared the statistics that both Member States submitted to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.
These statistics contained discrepancies.
The two courts of auditors consider it useful to discuss the statistics again at EU level in order to avoid any remaining discrepancies in the future.
If this does not happen, the statistics cannot be used appropriately for comparisons.
In addition, the statistics should include more information on the VAT.
Analysing detailed data can make it easier for the Commission to support Member States in their efforts to combat VAT fraud.
Both courts consider that Member States with a low recovery rate should try to achieve at least the average recovery rate.
The Commission should support the Member States in this, if it so wishes.
5. UST test at large companies
The Court of Auditors analysed the legal situation regarding the VAT audit of large companies in both states.
In addition, they used a questionnaire to collect information from the financial administrations that they considered important in this context.
At the same time, it became clear that the situation in both states is different.
For the selection of risk-related cases, the CZ has a system that includes a large amount of relevant data (including information on VAT audits, balance sheet data, and profit and loss accounts).
Overall, the UST control can thus be effectively controlled and analysed.
A special finance office for large companies is to be set up in 2012.
In Germany, there is still no comparable system, which makes it more difficult to control and analyse the overall VAT control.
The German financial administration is more focused on the selection of relevant individual cases and relies in particular on data from the VAT or VAT declarations and the ZM.
Various risk management components, which are to be improved, support the analysis of this data.

3.3 Cooperation between the two courts of auditors
In the run-up to the parallel audit, representatives of both audit courts met in September 2008 to discuss and define the audit topics.
In December 2008, the presidents of both courts signed the agreement on co-operation in the parallel audit.
At a meeting in Bonn in June 2009, the exam teams were briefed on the initial results obtained during the preparation of the exam, discussed possible approaches to the exam and agreed on the way forward.
A second meeting took place in Prague from 2 to 4 December 2009.
The audit teams exchanged the exam results obtained up to that point and agreed on the schedule for the preparation of the joint audit report.
The two courts of auditors defined the following topics for their parallel audit: • evaluation of the recommendations made in the previous report; • verification of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between taxable persons from the CZ and from Germany, which could not be fully clarified during the first parallel audit; • verification of selected intra-Community transactions between taxable persons from the CZ and Germany which are considered to be fraudulent; • examination of the procedures of the two tax administrations with regard to the interstate assistance in the case of VAT claims.
The report on the results of the parallel audit was prepared during a working meeting in June 2010.
4. Examination of the management of sales tax in selected areas
4.1 Implementation of the recommendations from the first joint audit
4.1.1 Implementation of recommendations in the Czech Republic
Recommendation 1
Harmonisation of the conditions for registration of taxpayers within the EU
Based on the results of the first audit, the Czech Court of Auditors has recommended adapting the requirements for VAT registration and introducing new rules for deleting registration in the CZ.
These amended rules should more effectively reduce the risk of possible tax evasion.
In certain cases, it was found that the VAT registration of taxable persons was not deleted if they did not comply with their obligations under Czech law no. 235 / 2004 (hereinafter referred to as the "VAT law").
To date, the Czech Ministry of Finance has not submitted any amendment to require the tax authorities to delete the tax if the taxable persons repeatedly do not file VAT declarations.
According to the Czech VAT law, the FA can delete ex officio the registration of a taxable person if a) the taxable person has not made any transactions for twelve consecutive months and has not informed the FA of the reasons for doing so; b) the taxable person has not fulfilled his obligations under the VAT law; c) the taxable person no longer meets the requirements for the duty of taxation.
The first examination had shown that, due to the existing legal situation, the Prague 1 FA had to delete the VAT registration of "foreign taxpayers" 3 with effect from 31 January of the following calendar year, if they were not obliged to register and pay VAT in the current calendar year.
The Prague 1 FA often did not delete the VAT registration of these taxpayers because the relevant provision of the deadline could not be properly implemented in practice.
The problem was solved by the amendment of the VAT law, which came into effect on 1 January 2009.
According to this, the FA is authorised to delete the registration of a foreign taxable person if in the previous calendar year he did not provide taxable or exempt goods or services with the right to deduct VAT.
Recommendation 2
Monthly payment of the ZM
On the basis of the initial audit, the Court of Auditors had recommended that the monthly levy of ZM be introduced.
The Council's directive, which shortened the time limit for the ZM to one month, was implemented in the CZ by the VAT law, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.
The ZM must now be delivered electronically.
In addition, an ZM must be issued if services whose place of performance is to be determined in accordance with § 9 (1) VAT law are provided for a person registered as subject to VAT in another Member State.
It is a condition that the recipient is obliged to declare and pay the VAT for these services, a obligation that arises from Council Directive 2008 / 8 / EC amending Directive 2006 / 112 / EC concerning the location of the service.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of the data of the VAT pre-registration and the ZM to increase the reliability of the MIAS data This recommendation related to the German financial administration.
In its ATIS4 system, the Czech financial administration automatically balances the data on intra-Community transactions from the VAT declarations and the ZM.
Recommendation 4
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level
The proper collection of the VAT is an essential prerequisite for the proper functioning of the EU internal market.
Therefore, the fight against VAT fraud is of primary interest and has received considerable attention in recent years.
The significance of this is confirmed, among other things, by a study published by the European Commission in October 2009.
In it, an external expert estimated the loss of VAT for the 25 Member States in the period 2000 to 2006. According to analysis of the available data, the tax loss for that period was between 90 and 113 billion Euros, based on the assumption that the EU-25 lose on average 12% of the turnover taxes due to them each year.
The estimated 0th tax loss for the CZ in 2006 was 18%.
The first assessment found that a Member State cannot develop an effective risk management system (RMS) on its own.
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each Member State.
Regarding the RMS, the Czech Court of Auditors has examined the system for the exchange of information within the EU (Eurocanet).
For this purpose, intra-EU transactions at high risk, carried out by taxpayers within the EU and recorded in Eurocanet, were selected (see chapter 4.3).
The aim of the EUROFISC network is to optimise mutual assistance in tax matters and to combat VAT fraud more effectively, and to improve cooperation between the competent authorities in order to detect cases of fraud as early as possible.
Later, EUROFISC could be used as a tool to estimate the risk potential of intra-Community transactions.
The ECOFIN Council approved EUROFISC on 7 October 2008 and at the same time adopted the principles for the operation of the system.
Eurocanet, developed by the Belgian financial administration in cooperation with the other Member States and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF7, serves as a model for EUROFISC.
The purpose of the system is to detect high-risk transactions and identify entrepreneurs involved in organised fraud.
4.1.2 Implementation of recommendations in Germany
The evaluation of the recommendations from the first report led to the following findings:
Recommendation 1
Harmonisation of the conditions for registration of taxpayers within the EU
On the basis of a detailed questionnaire, the German financial administration has developed a well-functioning system for registering taxpayers.
The Federal Ministry of Finance introduced this system to the Commission in October 2007.
The system itself is constantly being improved.
The data provided in the questionnaire will now be recorded electronically and will be available for research later. They will therefore be part of the risk management during registration.
The Commission had made a proposal to amend Regulation 1798 / 2003, which, among other things, established common standards for the registration and deletion of taxable persons.
Member States still needed clarification and clarification.
The Federal Audit Office had recommended to the Federal Ministry of Finance not to fall behind the standards already achieved.
Recommendation 2
Monthly payment of the ZM
On 8 April 2010, a law 9 on the transposition of EU directives into national law was adopted.
Among other things, it contains provisions for the monthly surrender of the ZM for intra-Community deliveries.
It will enter into force on 1 July 2010.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of the data of the VAT pre-registration and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and consideration of merging the previously separate procedures for submitting the VAT pre-applications and the ZM
A joint federal-state working group has been set up,
Which has developed a concept for the automatic comparison of the data from the pre-registration and the ZM.
The concept is still being discussed with the countries.
In addition, this working group has dealt with a concept for optimising the control procedure for intra-Community transactions.
Recommendation 4
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level.
Germany participates in the risk management platform.
The European Commission supported the initiative and, in the written procedure of 18 October 2006, initiated the establishment of a risk management platform within the Fiscalis 2006-2007 action plan.
The members of the platform dealt in 4 sub-groups with the following topics: • risk management tools, • influencing the behaviour of taxpayers, • evaluation, • updating the guideline on risk management.
New reports from the risk management instruments subgroups and the update of the risk management guideline were published in early 2010.
4.1.3 Evaluation
Registration
The issue of the conditions for the registration of the VAT and its deletion in different countries has been dealt with at EU level.
The draft amended Council Regulation 1798 / 2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT and repealing Regulation (EEC) 218 / 92 provides for the expansion of current databases within the EU, including a database of VAT identification numbers.
This proposal also includes common standards for the registration and deletion of taxpayers.
The questions of registration and deletion are reserved for the national legislation of the EU Member States until further notice.
Member States still needed clarification and clarification.
The Federal Audit Office had recommended the Federal Ministry of Finance not to fall behind the standards already reached.
The last version of the draft was agreed by the Member States in ECOFIN on 8 June 2010.
It no longer includes common rules for the registration and deletion of taxable persons.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The two courts of auditors regret this. They still consider such regulations to be important in order to prevent VAT fraud.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Monthly payment of the ZM
With regard to international cooperation, it was recommended, as a result of the previous audit, that all Member States introduce the monthly levy of the ZM in order to allow an earlier examination of the amounts of intra-Community transactions.
Council Directive 2008 / 117 / EC amending Directive 2006 / 112 / EC on the common system of value added tax for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions has reduced the turnaround for the submission of the corresponding ZM to one month.
In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by the amendment of the VAT law, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.
Germany did not implement the commitment to the monthly ZM levy until 1 July 2010 and thus did not meet the deadline, while the CZ complied with the EU's requirements.
Comparison of the data of the VAT pre-registration and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and consideration of merging the previously separate procedures for submitting the VAT pre-registration or ZM
The German financial administration has taken up the recommendations of the Federal Audit Office and has set up a working group to work out possible solutions.
The Federal Audit Office will monitor the further development.
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level
Germany and the CZ use different approaches to identify high-risk entrepreneurs.
The Czech Court of Auditors examined the application of the Eurocanet system in CZ (see section 4.3).
The Federal Audit Office focused on German participation in the risk management platform.
4.2 Control of selected intra-Community transactions
The first audit looked together at transactions where there were doubts as to whether they had actually been carried out or whether discrepancies had been detected in the reports of taxpayers in both Member States.
For the audit, the two courts of auditors selected nine cases of intra-Community supply of goods between the CZ and Germany, where the tax assessment by the Member State concerned had not yet been completed at the time of the previous joint audit.
(1)
A Czech taxable person purchased goods worth 22 686 euros from a German taxable person in the first quarter of 2005.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare the acquisition in his VAT declaration, since the period mentioned in the German tax bill did not have a VAT identification number, but only a tax number for intra-German transactions.
Through international mutual assistance in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the competent Czech FA had received information that, according to German VAT law, the supplier of intra-Community goods does not require a VAT identification number in order to benefit from the exemption of intra-Community supplies of goods.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that, according to the audit carried out by the competent Czech FA, the Czech taxable person submitted an additional VAT declaration declaring the purchase of goods in the above-mentioned value, while at the same time claiming the same amount of VAT deductions.
(2)
In the fourth quarter of 2004, a Czech taxable person was reported to have purchased goods worth 12 561 euros from a German taxable person.
However, he said he had not purchased the goods and therefore did not declare it in his UST statement.
The German financial administration refused to process the request, citing a provision of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, because the turnover associated with the acquisition did not exceed the threshold of 15,000 euros.
Since the Czech FA was not able to obtain documents, the tax audit remained unsuccessful and the original tax determination was maintained.
The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech FA from Germany received two spontaneous reports in accordance with the Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, according to which the German taxpayer had invoiced the delivery of the goods in question to a Slovak addressee.
The Czech taxpayer purchased the goods from the Slovak taxable person and indicated the acquisition in his regular VAT statement for the month of October 2004.
(3)
A Czech taxable person is alleged to have purchased a car worth 48 500 euros from a German taxable person in the fourth quarter of 2004.
However, he did not declare any intra-Community acquisition.
In addition, he had not made a UST statement since August 2004, which is why the FA set the VAT at CZK 0 for the quarter in question.
On the basis of information received from Germany in the course of the international exchange of information in accordance with the Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the FA requested the taxable person in March 2007 to submit a subsequent tax declaration, which the taxpayer omitted.
The audit found that the FA had carried out further audit work in this tax case in 2007, when it found that the car in question had been sold by the taxpayer to a used car dealer in the CZ.
The Czech FA carried out an assessment for the December 2004 tax period, setting additional taxes of CZK 295 379 for the purchase and resale of goods from another Member State.
The competent Czech court decided to open insolvency proceedings on the assets of the Czech taxable person; an insolvency administrator was appointed.
In the absence of significant assets, the outstanding tax debt is likely to be unrecoverable.
4) Moonlight
In the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, a Czech taxable person was reported to have delivered new vehicles (passenger cars) with a total value of 198 167 euros to Germany.
In response to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, it was stated that a tax penalty procedure was pending against the German taxpayer in Germany.
The audit by the Federal Audit Office showed that after the conclusion of the proceedings there was evidence of the involvement of the German taxpayer in fraud.
The intra-Community acquisition of goods was subjected to employment taxation amounting to 182 424 Euro (for 2004) and 369 690 Euro (for 2005).
The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors found that the Czech taxpayer was involved in carousel fraud involving new vehicles.
On the basis of information provided by the German financial administration, a VAT audit of the Czech taxpayer took place for the tax periods of April, May and June 2005.
Based on the test findings and information from the international exchange of information, the FA set additional VAT at 703 031 CZK for May 2005 and 726 551 CZK for June 2005.
5) Moonlight
Czech taxable person A is alleged to have purchased a machine with a total value of 58 000 Euros from a German taxpayer in February 2005.
In the third quarter of 2004, the German taxable person was alleged to have delivered a machine valued at 88 027 euros to the Czech tax payer B. B, however, denied the acquisition.
The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that B had purchased the machine from a German company with a branch in the CZ.
Czech taxable person A did not specify the purchase of the goods from the said German taxpayer in his declaration of VAT.
The German FA's response to a request for information in accordance with the Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 showed that the German taxpayer had not made an intra-Community delivery of a machine with a value of 58 000 Euros, but had made a delivery within the CZ.
In the audit, the Federal Audit Office found that the intra-Community delivery of the machine after completion of an audit was classified as domestic delivery and the VAT exemption was subsequently refused.
6) Mourinho
In the third quarter of 2004, a German taxable person was reported to have delivered to a Czech taxable person goods worth 11 600 euros.
The goods were purchased and later sold in Germany, i.e. in 2005.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors found that the Czech FA had established its predisposition on the basis of a supplementary VAT declaration, which prohibited purchases from another Member State, including purchases in the above-mentioned amount.
The Federal Audit Office found that after receiving a reply to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the German FA corrected the VAT declaration of the German taxpayer and set an additional VAT of 1,600 euros.
Due to the resale of the goods in Germany and the corresponding UST predisposition there, an audit is under way.
The ZM of the German taxable person has not yet been corrected, since in Germany only the taxable person who has surrendered the ZM can correct it.
7) Beyonce
The competent Czech FA received a request for information from the German financial administration in accordance with the Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 on the question of the acquisition of a car worth 47 400 euros by a Czech taxpayer in February 2005.
After a review for the 2005 tax period, the Czech FA set the tax debt of the Czech taxable person at CZK 0 and informed the German FA that it could not confirm the acquisition of the car by the Czech taxpayer.
The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors found that the registration of the Czech VAT collector had been cancelled because he had not complied with his tax obligations.
The Czech FA sent the documents to the Czech police.
The German taxpayer has not so far corrected his information in the ZM, but has appealed against the tax ruling.
8) Moonlight
According to MIAS10, between the third quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, a German taxable person supplied a Czech taxable person with a total value of 33 205 euros, which he did not declare as an intra-Community acquisition.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors found that the Czech FA investigated the reasons for the discrepancies.
For the first quarter of 2005, the Czech taxable person repeatedly made subsequent VAT declarations.
However, the Czech FA was unable to clarify the difference between the purchases of CZK 134 273 in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005, based on the fact that sales for individual quarters could not be accurately allocated, and accepted the UST declarations made.
9) Beyonce
In the third quarter of 2004, a German taxable person had delivered to a Czech taxable person goods worth 46 854 euros.
For the same period, the Czech taxpayer declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only 14,856 euros.
As part of the interstate exchange of information in accordance with the Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the Czech FA reviewed the actual value of the delivery.
With the German answer to this request, three invoices were sent, which showed a total value of the delivered goods of 31,998 euros, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech taxpayer and the MIAS data.
According to the results of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors, following repeated warnings from the FA, the Czech taxpayer submitted a subsequent VAT declaration in January 2007 for the tax period of July 2004.
With this declaration, the taxable person made his claim for deduction at the same time. Therefore, his tax debt for the respective tax period remained unchanged.
The audit confirmed that most of the tax procedures for the transactions selected for the audit had been completed and that the financial administrations in the CZ or Germany had taken appropriate measures (e.g. subsequent VAT requirements or prevention of pre-tax refunds).
4.3 Testing of selected cases of risk-related intra-Community transactions
4.3.1 Findings in the Czech Republic
Eurocanet can be an important source of information to identify high-risk taxpayers in the acquisition Member State.
In the CZ, the early warning information obtained from Eurocanet is checked by the competent FA with the purchasers.
Since the first quarter of 2008, the CZ has provided information on turnover and taxable suppliers, which are considered at risk, to the Eurocanet system.
Nine Czech taxpayers were selected for the audit,
Entered into the Eurocanet by the financial administrations of other Member States, either as suppliers or purchasers.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Since the German financial administration did not participate in the data exchange via Eurocanet, it was not possible to determine whether suppliers with German VAT identification numbers were considered risky by the German financial administration.
The audit found both normal transactions and those suspected of carousel fraud or other fraud.
In the cases concerned, the parties exchanged information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003,
For example:
• In the examination of the early warning information, the Fähr did not identify any suspicions of risky transactions.
The taxpayers in question were constantly monitored because their data was stored in Eurocanet.
• In the checks of the high-risk transactions, the companies failed to prove breaches of the rules for calculating the tax base and the VAT on the basis of the accounting documents submitted, even though they detected discrepancies in the transport and storage of the goods or discovered business relations with mail order companies from other Member States.
• The review of individual business transactions was complicated because certain taxpayers did not cooperate with the tax authorities and could not be contacted.
The competent authorities reviewed most of the high-risk taxable persons and transactions mentioned in Eurocanet's early warning messages.
However, their options for checking risk-related transactions, especially so-called "missing traders," are limited.
In particular, a mere examination of the documents can hardly prove the fraudulent behaviour of the taxable person.
Tougher registration requirements for taxable persons for VAT purposes and greater flexibility in deleting registrations would help to combat VAT fraud.
The taxable persons involved in fraudulent carousel transactions can be registered for the purposes of the VAT, in order to deceive fictitious goods deliveries throughout the EU or formally issue correct tax receipts to other taxpayers, with which they can then make unauthorized claims for deduction of VAT.
In case of suspected carousel fraud in connection with imports and exports, it is recommended that the customs and tax authorities cooperate more closely in order to be able to monitor the legality of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final buyer.
Member States can participate in Eurocanet on a voluntary basis.
The fact that three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate was considered by the European Parliament at the end of 200811 as a weakness of the system, which should be remedied by setting up a EUROFISC network with mandatory participation.
4.3.2 Findings in Germany
The Federal Audit Office evaluated data available from the Federal Central Office for Taxation, including data from Eurocanet.
They served as the basis for the selection of six German taxpayers whose files have been reviewed.
Both Germany and a number of other countries refused to participate actively in Eurocanet.
For this reason, Germany has a passive status, i.e. it does not send data to Brussels itself, but is only a recipient of Eurocanet data.
This is justified by the fact that "from the point of view of the Federal Government
No legal basis [exists] that would allow the tax secrecy existing in Germany to be broken.
In addition, the Federal Government has no reliable knowledge of how information sent by the Member States is processed within the framework of Eurocanet. "12 Since October 2007, the Federal Tax Office has been evaluating the Eurocanet data and transmitting it to the federal and state tax authorities on the basis of a coordinated procedure.
The German tax authorities will receive control notices on the direct business relations of the taxpayers registered with them in Eurocanet with companies from other EU countries.
However, the German FA does not know whether the company from the above-mentioned other EU Member State has business relations with a company based in another Member State, which is also linked to the German company in the control notice.
4.3.3 Evaluation
The CZ is an active participant in Eurocanet, while Germany has only a passive status.
From the point of view of an active participant, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to participate actively.
Accordingly, the test had to be carried out differently in this area.
However, it has not been possible to identify significant differences in the success of detecting VAT fraud, due to the fact that Eurocanet is only one component of the risk management system.
However, the financial administrations of both countries have a variety of other tools to detect fraudulent transactions, but it is still necessary to develop a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.
The Council of the European Union has agreed on a draft regulation to create EUROFISC, a network for the fight against VAT fraud.
The experience gained so far with Eurocanet should be shared by the Member States at European level and incorporated into this network.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The cases brought before the courts at national and European level show that a discussion between the Member States and the Commission on the conditions for the exemption of intra-Community transactions is required.
4.4 Mutual assistance in the recovery of claims
4.4.1 Interstate assistance in the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic
The legislation on intergovernmental assistance to recover certain claims in the EU is essentially based on:
- Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to measures which form part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as levies and tariffs;
Council Directive 2001 / 44 / EC amending Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to measures which form part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as exhaustion and customs duties and VAT and certain excise duties; and
Commission Directive 2002 / 94 / EC laying down detailed rules for the implementation of certain articles of Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to certain duties, duties, taxes and other measures.
The CZ implemented Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC by Law No. 252 / 2000 on intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of certain claims.
Following the adoption of Council Directive 2001 / 44 / EC, it was also necessary to transpose it into Czech law, and at the same time to amend the aforementioned law.
In this context, Amendment No 191 / 2004 on intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of certain claims has been adopted.
A new significant piece of legislation was adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1179 / 2008 of 28 November 2008.
The annexes to this regulation contain new application forms to be used from 1 January 2009. Furthermore, the regulation makes electronic transmission mandatory and requires the requesting authority to certify the conformity of all documents sent to the respective original.
The main principles of international mutual assistance for the recovery of claims are:
1. The principle of reciprocity applies;
2. Mutual assistance is to be provided only on request and if all conditions are fulfilled;
3. Mutual assistance does not extend to claims that are considered a criminal sanction in the requested State;
4. The procedure of intergovernmental assistance for recovery of claims must be carried out in accordance with the national law of the requested State;
5. Foreign claims do not take precedence over domestic claims in the accession procedure;
6. Mutual assistance is provided only for the recovery of undisputed claims;
7. The principle of utilization applies: The requesting State must use all the means available to it under national law to recover the claim.
Law No 191 / 2004 provides for three forms of mutual assistance: The issuing of information, the notification of legal acts and the actual recovery.
Procedure for outgoing requests to other EU member states
The competent FA has the right to transmit the request for information, the request for notification of legal acts or the request for recovery, together with the relevant documents, electronically to the Ministry of Finance of the CZ via the respective financial directorate.
The Ministry of Finance of the CZ initiates the translation of the request into the language in question, scans it with all the appendices and transmits it via the communication network or the common interface CCN / CSI of the competent financial authority of the state in question.
A request for recovery aid must meet the following requirement: The claim must exceed EUR 1 500 and must not be older than five years.
The requested authority may refuse recovery if the requirements are not met.
Procedure for in-depth requests from other Member States
The Ministry of Finance of the CZ must confirm the receipt of requests from other Member States as soon as possible, at the latest within seven days.
If it decides not to grant the request, it must inform the requesting authority of the reasons for the refusal, specifying the specific provisions of the directive on which it is based.
The corresponding notice must be sent at the latest three months after the date of receipt of the request.
After receiving the request, the Ministry of Finance will examine whether the request meets all legal requirements.
It will then send the request to the competent FA via the financial directorate in question. If the request for intervention is accepted, the FA must, among other things, determine the financial situation of the debtor, for example by extracting from the land register, inquiring about existing bank accounts and registering cars with the registration office.
After the expiration of six months from the date of receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ shall inform the requesting authority of the outcome of the investigation.
The requesting authority must also be informed if the taxable persons in question are not available and therefore the claim cannot be added.
All sums successfully contributed must be transferred to the requesting authority within one month of recovery.
With the consent of the requesting State, the Czech FA concerned with the recovery can agree to the claim for hours or instalments.
The interest or surcharges imposed on the debtor for the period of delay in accordance with Law No. 337 / 1992 concerning the administration of taxes and fees
The requesting state is entitled to do so.
In particular in 2006 and 2007, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ has delayed sending the requests for membership to the competent FA.
The same was true for the forwarding of the application for membership submitted by the Czech authorities to the competent authority in the requested State.
The audit found that the Ministry of Finance had breached the Interstate Administrative Assistance Act for the recovery of receivables. It had failed to inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the state of play of the recovery procedure within six months from the confirmation of receipt of the request.
The situation has improved since 2008.
Statistical data
Pursuant to section 13 (4) of Law 191 / 2004, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ will produce a statistic for the European Commission, which will contain the number of requests for information, the delivery of legal documents and recovery, including the amount of the respective claims, which were submitted in the previous year.
Based on the data provided by the Member States, the European Commission is preparing its report to the Council and the European Parliament on the application of the mutual assistance provisions in the recovery of claims.
The audit showed that in 2008, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ declared the claims to be too low by 5 250 000 Euros. The reason was the incorrect indication of the amount of a UST claim introduced in 2008 (caused by the postponement of a decimal point in the conversion of the claim from Czech crowns to euros).
The error was subsequently reflected in the statistics of the European Commission.
Information on mutual assistance for recovery can be found in the table below.
4.4.2 Interstate assistance in the recovery of claims in Germany
The legal basis for the mutual assistance in tax matters is the Community law standards Council Directive 2008 / 55 / EC of 26 May 2008 (EC Withdrawal Directive) 14 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1178 / 2008 of 28 November 2008 (EC Implementation Directive).
For better readability and clarity, the EC recovery directive codified Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC of 15 March 197616, the provisions of which had been substantially amended several times.
Among other things, it regulates the recovery of VAT and taxes on income and assets, including the associated interest, fees and surcharges.
The EU's recovery directive was transposed into German law by the Act of Restoration (EC) 17 of 3 May 2003.
The enforcement procedure in Germany is regulated in the tax code (AO).
Section 117 (2) of the AO provides that the financial authorities may provide intergovernmental legal and administrative assistance in accordance with international treaties and the legal standards of the European Communities applicable in national law, as well as by virtue of the EC Official Aid Act.
Part Six of the AO (section 249-346) contains the law governing enforcement proceedings.
The administration of the tax authorities is governed in particular by the enforcement and enforcement instructions.
The Federal Ministry of Finance has reached an agreement with the representatives of the Supreme Finance Authorities of the Länder on the principles of mutual assistance in tax matters and has transferred its own responsibility in this area to the Federal Tax Office.
The general conditions for admissibility of recovery aid requests are:
• The legal requirements must be fulfilled (§ 251, 254 AO).
• All recovery funds available domestically have been exhausted.
• The claims for which mutual assistance is requested for their recovery are irrefutable.
• The period between the issue of the enforcement order or the date on which the claim or title became unassailable and the date of the request may not exceed five years.
• The claim must be at least 1,500 euros.
Proceedings for outgoing requests to other EU member states The German requests for recovery of backdated taxes are sent by the enforcement bodies of the tax authority via the competent central authority and the Federal Office of Taxation to the relevant foreign authority, e.g. the Czech CLO.
The details are set out in the fact sheet on intergovernmental assistance in the tax collection (recovery) of 19 January 200419.
This leaflet is currently being revised by a federal-state working group and is being adapted to the new recovery directive.
The request will be forwarded by the FA to the central authority in addition to the installations.
The latter examines whether it is correct in terms of content and form.
If not, the request will be returned to the FA in question.
Otherwise, it will be sent to the Federal Central Tax Office.
The Federal Tax Office will then take over the necessary communication with the relevant foreign authority.
Procedure for incoming requests from other EU member states
Requests for contributions from other Member States are registered in the Federal Central Tax Office, which sends a receipt within ten days.
It also checks whether the formal conditions are fulfilled.
In principle, the Federal Tax Office forwards these requests to the central authority, which directs them to the relevant FA and supervises the execution.
The Federal Tax Office also sends interim and final reports.
If the processing of a request takes longer than six months, it reminds the central authority of the obligation to submit an interim report in accordance with Article 16 of the Commission's Directive 2002 / 94 / EC.
After examining the formal and factual requirements for admissibility of the request, the enforcement bodies announce relevant measures.
All contributions must be transferred to the bank account indicated in the request within one month of receipt.
Statistical data
Information on mutual recovery aid between Germany and the CZ for the years 2006 to 2008 (as at 31 December 2008).
4.4.3 Examining selected recovery cases
A total of 21 intergovernmental requests for recovery between the CZ and Germany have been selected for the examination. Below are ten cases in which, among others,
The following has been established:
1.
On 20 October 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German application for the recovery of the VAT debt of a Czech taxpayer in 2004 and 2005 for a total of 3 883 Euros (109 820 CZK).
It was not until 26 February 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the application for membership to the competent FA.
In order to secure the claim, the Czech FA burdened a property belonging to the taxpayer with a basic pledge.
Since the burdened land was not sufficient to settle the entire tax debt, a rate payment agreement of at least CZK 2 000 per month was reached with the debtor.
An interim report was sent to the German FA on 31 August 2009, according to which the taxpayer had in the meantime settled tax debts amounting to CZK 49 600 (as of 25 August 2009).
The amount was transferred to Germany. Shortly after, on 28 August 2009, a further CZK 3,000 was transferred.
2.
On 7 January 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for the recovery of tax debts (VAT, income tax) as well as interest and fees of a Czech taxpayer totalling 180 869 Euros (= 4 434 915 CZK).
It was not until 27 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the application for membership to the competent FA.
After checking the bank balance, securities, real estate, motor vehicles and other movable assets, the FA found that the debtor did not have mortgages.
On-site investigations also revealed that the debtor had been absent from his permanent residence for almost a year.
His whereabouts in the CZ were unknown.
The Czech Ministry of Finance received this notice on 6 April 2009 and passed it on to the German financial administration on 16 April 2009.
3.
On November 21, 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German application for membership for VAT plus interest and fees totalling 3,139 euros (= CZK 84 846).
It was not until 6 August 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the application for membership to the competent FA. On 18 February 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance from Germany was informed that the Czech tax debtor had since settled the debt.
On 9 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance informed the Czech FA that the case was closed because the Czech tax collector had fully settled its debt in Germany.
However, the debt was also settled in the CZ under the recovery procedure and the corresponding amount was transferred to Germany on 27 October 2008.
Due to the long time it took for the Czech Ministry of Finance to forward the information to the FA, the tax debt was paid twice - by the taxpayer himself in Germany and through recovery by the competent Czech FA.
In cooperation with the Federal Audit Office, it was found that the amount contributed was calculated against the tax debt from another procedure, amounting to 6,649 euros, which was to be transferred to the CZ in September 2008.
According to the documents of the Czech Ministry of Finance, there was only a request for recovery of 3,139 Euros for the company in question. The request for recovery of 6,649 Euros could not be found there.
4.
On 15 September 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German application for the recovery of income tax, VAT, interest and fees totalling EUR 39 957 = CZK 956 654.
It was not until 19 December 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the application for membership to the competent FA.
On 1 June 2009, the proceedings for the recovery were opened and a decision was made to seize the Czech bank credit and the debtor's salary (CZK 7 000).
During the negotiations with the FA, the debtor did not agree to the amount of the tax debt and the amount was disputed.
According to the Czech FA, the debtor had been willing to pay 250 euros a month in the past, but the German FA did not agree to this.
The taxman agreed to discuss his matter with the German FA in order to agree on a different amount.
The accession procedure was not yet completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.
5.
On 19 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German application for the recovery of income tax of the year 2005 and VAT for the years 2003 to 2007, together with interest and fees totalling 113 444 Euros = 3 116 304 CZK.
It was not until 14 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the application for membership to the Prague FA 1, which is not authorised to deal with tax cases of taxable persons residing in the CZ; on the basis of the available address, a local authority could not be established.
In its investigation, the FA received information and documents on 19 September 2008 that the debtor's income was 4,704 Euros. However, it was not able to issue an enforcement order because the request for recovery was received after that date.
On 26 January 2009, the Czech FA initiated the recovery procedure and issued an enforcement order to seize the debtor's credit at credit institutions.
The accession procedure was not yet completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.
6.
On 3 October 2006, the competent Czech FA requested inter-governmental assistance in the recovery of a debt due to VAT, together with procedural costs totalling 146 223 742 CZK.
It was only on 13 May 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the application for membership to the German financial administration.
On 8 September 2008, the competent German FA, through the Bundesbank, transferred to the Czech authorities the amount of 17 700 euros, or CZK 439 226, to be paid by the bank.
A conversion error was discovered during the review of the amounts contributed.
The amount to be paid, 146 223 742 CZK, was calculated at the exchange rate of 1 Euro = 25,065 CZK, but a commons error resulted in an amount of 583 378 Euro.
The correct amount was 5,833,782 euros.
As a result, an application for accession, which was too low by 5,250 404 euros, was made.
7.
On 1 March 2007, the competent Czech FA requested recovery due to a VAT debt, together with interest and fees of a Czech taxpayer totalling CZK 1,970 632 = 79 847 euros.
It was not until 10 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the application for membership to the German financial administration.
The German FA asked the debtor to pay the arrears on 4 February 2009.
Taking into account the significant reduction in the company's turnover in the second half of 2008 and in particular in the first half of 2009 and the corresponding liquidity situation, the following payments were made to settle the overdue tax debt: On 8 April 2009 - 4 600 Euros, on 6 May 2009 -3 000 Euros and on 16 June 2009 - 2 500 Euros.
These payments were transferred to the account of the competent FA in the Czech Republic.
On 23 June 2009, a further payment of €2,500 was agreed between the debtor and the FA until 30 June 2009.
8.
On 22 May 2008, the competent Czech FA requested the recovery of tax debts totalling 398 653 Euro = 9 832 779 CZK, which included, among other things, land acquisition tax.
It was not until 2 October 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the application for membership to the German financial administration.
In a letter from the German financial administration to the Czech Ministry of Finance dated 3 April 2009, the request was returned.
The German financial administration justified this by saying that the property acquisition tax was not a tax within the meaning of Article 2 (e), (f), (g) and (h) of Directive 2008 / 55 / EC.
In addition, Article 2 (g) covers liabilities arising from taxes on income and assets.
Accordingly, Article 3 of Directive 2008 / 55 / EC applies to taxes on income and property, which are not mentioned in Article 1, paragraph 3 and 4 of Directive 77 / 799 / EEC.
The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed to send a new request for recovery to the German financial administration, which should no longer include VAT arrears of CZK 61 759, but the arrears of VAT, corporation tax and income tax.
The Czech Ministry of Finance has received a new request from the competent FA for recovery of tax debts of the same taxable person amounting to CZK 7 779 735.
9.
On 6 February 2006, the competent Czech FA sent the Czech Ministry of Finance a request for the recovery of income tax and VAT totalling 3 445 782 CZK = 123 328 Euro.
The VAT charge was CZK 1 133 967.
Only on 18 April 2007 did the Czech Ministry of Finance forward the application for membership to the German financial administration
And it was not until 11 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance sent the Czech FA a reply from the German financial administration on 9 July 2007,
After the German FA issued an enforcement order on 11 June 2007 to seize the bank account, the bank announced that it was not in contact with the mentioned taxable person.
This meant that the request for the German financial administration was deemed to have been settled.
10.
On 26 September 2005, the competent Czech FA sent to the Czech Ministry of Finance a request for the recovery of the VAT debt totalling 1 296 845 CZK = 43 591 Euro.
The responsible Finance Directorate made the request to the Ministry of Finance on 10 October 2005.
The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request to the German financial administration on 15 December 2005.
Before submitting the request, the Czech FA enforced the tax requirement by seizing bank accounts, collecting salaries and burdening a plot of land.
A request for information was sent to the German financial administration on 16 March 2005 prior to the application for membership.
According to a reply sent to the Czech FA on 16 September 2005, the Czech taxable person was resident in Germany and had income from non-self-employment amounting to 8,437 Euros. On 20 April 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a reply to the request for recovery and did not forward it to the relevant Czech FA until 12 February 2008.
According to him, the tax debt in Germany was unrecoverable due to the debtor's inability to pay.
No assets had been identified, and the income from non-self-employment was already the subject of other enforcement measures.
The German financial administration considered the request to be settled.
4.4.4 Comparison and Evaluation
In the case of recovery, the requirements of EU law apply to all EU Member States for intergovernmental assistance.
The procedures for processing requests are therefore similar in the CZ and Germany.
The Federal Court of Justice and the NK have compared the statistics that the two Member States submitted to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.
Inconsistencies were noticed.
In its report of 200620, the European Commission recommended that the Member States produce their statistics with greater care.
In 200921, the Commission concluded that, despite the increase in the number of requests for assistance, the discrepancies in the statistics had diminished.
Both courts consider that a renewed discussion at EU level on the statistics makes sense, so that the remaining discrepancies can be avoided in the future.
If this does not happen, the statistics are very significant and cannot be used for comparisons.
In addition, the Court of Auditors considers that the statistics should show both the annual number of requests and the nature of claims (e.g. VAT, income tax) and the amount of payments per Member State.
By analysing the statistics provided by the Member States in more detail, the Commission could help Member States assess their measures to combat fraud.
Since the recovery rate can be calculated per Member State, the audit bodies argue that Member States with a low rate should at least aim for the average recovery rate within the EU.
At the request of a Member State, the Commission could play an active role in this.
The foreign requests for recovery received by the Ministry of Finance in CZ were delayed in 2006 and 2007, in particular, and passed on to the competent authorities.
The same applies to the requests for membership made by the Czech authorities.
The audit found that the Czech Ministry of Finance was in breach of Law No. 191 / 2004 on intergovernmental recovery aid, in that it did not inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the progress of the recovery measures within the six-month period from receipt of the request.
4.5 Inspection of VAT on large companies
4.5.1 Tax Inspection of Major Enterprises in the Czech Republic
General
The tax system for large companies is subject to the same rules that apply to other taxpayers.
The examination of large companies is regulated by Czech Law No. 337 / 1992, the "Tax and Fee Management Act."
The Czech Ministry of Finance defines large companies as natural persons who have set up a business or legal entities established to carry out a business operation and whose net turnover for the respective tax period is at least CZK 2 billion, according to the declaration of income or corporation tax.
The taxable person is classified as a large company on the basis of the turnover amount. Income or corporation tax returns in the respective tax period; for the first time for the year 2003.
A natural or legal person is no longer managed as a large company for the purpose of taxing turnover if, in three consecutive periods, its net turnover in the tax period is less than CZK 2 billion. The period begins at the end of the tax period, for which the conditions were fulfilled for the first time according to the tax declaration.
A taxable person can only be removed from the list of large companies if at least one type of tax has been examined in advance for a tax period.
By the end of 2009, all large companies were audited at least every five years.
Since 2010, taxpayers have to be assessed in writing at least every two years, and the subsequent control measures are designed to remove the tax risks and their negative effects on proper tax determination and collection.
The tests carried out by the FSE should focus on at least one type of tax; they usually cover several periods of taxation.
The large taxable companies have been audited by the special audit bodies or audit services of the competent financial services, which have been set up for a total of 13 companies.
A special audit unit carried out audits in its local area of responsibility according to the instructions of the head of the financial directorate.
In addition, she also checked:
Taxable persons with unusual and special business activities and
Those whose examination required a high level of expertise and time.
It also examines taxpayers with complex location distribution and organizational structure,
Taxpayers suspected of large-scale tax evasion
As well as taxpayers belonging to chains and networks where there is suspicion of extensive tax evasion and unjustified tax deductions.
Information on the number of examinations carried out by the special inspection units of the FSB and the tax-related results of these audits are given in Table No. 3.
The Czech Ministry of Finance has put forward a proposal to amend Law No. 531 / 1990 for the regional tax authorities, in particular the creation of a special financial office with national responsibility for selected taxpayers (legal entities established for the purpose of economic activity, with a turnover of at least CZK 2 billion).
4.5.2 Tax Inspection for Large Enterprises in Germany
General
The VAT audit of large companies is not particularly regulated in Germany. General regulations apply to company audits • of the tax code (AO), • of the Financial Management Act (FVG) and • of the audit regulations (BPO).
In addition, there are work aids.
Taxation
The provisions of Sections 193 to 203 AO "Section 4 external audit" contain in particular rules for the admissibility of an external audit and its factual scope, distribution of responsibilities, the form and content of the announcement of the audit, the principles of the examination, the obligations of the taxable party to cooperate and the requirements for final discussions and for the transmission of the audit report.
External audits will be carried out by the competent authorities (Section 195 AO).
According to § 5 paragraph 1 No. 1 in conjunction with § 19, it is the responsibility of the Federal Central Office for Taxation to participate in external audits of the tax authorities.
The nature and scope of this involvement will be agreed between the authorities involved.
In addition, the Federal Central Office for Taxation can require that certain companies made famous by it be audited at a certain point in time.
In this case, it can establish regulations for the external inspection of these taxable persons.
In accordance with Article 108 (7) GG, the operating audit regulations (BPO 2000) were adopted with the approval of the Federal Council.
It applies to external audits of the state financial authorities and the Federal Central Office for Taxation.
According to § 3 BPO, companies are regularly classified in size classes.
Large companies have to undergo a follow-up inspection (point 4.2 BPO).
According to section 33.1 BPO, each competent financial authority must keep a group register within the meaning of the regulation.
Administrative tools
In addition, the following work aids have been issued for the administration:
• "Single manual for the special VAT inspection";
• VAT countries online - USLO (= dialogue system in the intra-Community VAT control procedure) with guidance on how to use the data contained in MIAS on intra-Community business relations;
• Work aids for difficult and special situations.
• Central database for storing and analyzing VAT fraud cases and developing risk profiles;
The taxable persons are classified in size classes based on criteria such as turnover and profit, whereas the limits vary according to the branch of business.
The figures will be published by the Federal Ministry of Finance.
The values are reviewed every three years and set for the following three years.
The number of companies - not only the large ones - is to be determined regularly (last cut-off date: 1 January 2010).
In general, large companies have to be scrutinised completely.
The tests are announced and usually extend to the UST,
In other words, the audit covers all relevant taxes, namely income tax, corporation tax, commercial tax and VAT.
The sales tax can either be checked by auditors or special VAT inspectors.
The practice is different and depends on the administrative structure of the individual countries.
The number of tax periods covered by an audit usually varies between three and five years.
The BPO 2000 is based on three years.
The audit is subject to all taxes to which a company has been charged.
4.5.3 Management of VAT audit at large companies
In accordance with the agreement, both courts of auditors did not examine individual cases. They investigated the question of how the financial administrations proceed in the VAT audit of large companies.
Using a questionnaire, they collected information from the financial administrations that is essential for the audit of large companies.
• Which statistical records and analyses for the VAT audit of large companies are available to the management of the tax administration?
In particular:
• Are there statistics or records of the difference between the VAT fraud control and the general VAT assessment?
CZ: No, the current version of the ATIS system makes no such distinction possible.
Germany: The financial administration does not distinguish between audits to combat VAT fraud and general VAT audits.
• Are there any statistics or records on the closeness of the tests?
CZ: Data on the closeness of audits of intra-Community purchases of selected VAT receivers are recorded in the ATIS system;
The same applies to information on the start and end of the FA's examination.
Germany: No, the statistics for auditors collected at the federal level only contain information about the so-called average last audit period (year).
This figure does not give an overview of the testing periods selected for individual companies.
USt special examiners focus on the last VAT assessment periods and are also authorised to audit large companies.
The statistics for USt special examiners, which are kept at the federal level, do not contain information on the size class of the inspected company.
• There are statistics or records of the type of the additional result; for example, divided by:
I. real added value (e.g. application of a reduced rate instead of the general VAT rate)
II. Unreal additional earnings (e.g. relocation / postponement of facts not objectionable in respect of turnover tax law to another period of taxation)
III. Cash effect (payment of the fixed additional profit)
CZ:
The Czech tax administration monitors the number of tax audits carried out, the amount of additional tax income broken down by tax type, the number of taxable persons audited and the number of tax periods audited.
Other tax procedures (on-the-spot investigations, payment procedures) are monitored in the same way.
Regardless of this, the amount of repayments and the payments received will be recorded.
Tax debt statistics are broken down by types of tax, but there is no distinction between tax debts generated by a tax return and those resulting from audit actions by the FA.
Germany: No, the statistics collected at the federal level for auditors and special inspectors do not differ according to the above criteria.
Nor did most tax authorities, where local surveys were carried out, differentiate in this respect.
• Are exam areas with high results recorded?
CZ: Yes, the FA can select cases on the basis of criteria linked to selected indicators stored in the ATIS system.
Germany: There are no regulations at federal level.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level do not provide such information for auditors and UST special examiners.
However, the federal and state finance ministries have agreed on a common approach.
According to this, auditors and tax collectors of the countries have to enter in ZAUBER the additional tax result they have achieved if a certain threshold is exceeded.
In this case, additional information must be provided, for example, on the origin of the additional VAT achieved.
• What are the most common findings?
CZ:
- large companies subject to tax have unjustifiably claimed the deduction of VAT for related supplies and services,
• which were not used for a business activity according to § 72 (1) CZ UStG;
• used for representation according to § 75 (3) CZ UStG;
• based on invoices that do not meet the requirements of § 73 (1) CZ UStG
- large taxable undertakings have omitted the application of VAT to be paid provided for in § 21 (1) CZ UStG.
Germany: There are no regulations at federal level.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level do not provide such information for auditors and UST special examiners.
Findings on VAT from audits of large companies are not recorded separately by the countries.
However, the Federal Tax Office can evaluate the ZAUBER database, in which the auditors and tax investigators of the Länder have to enter the additional tax result they achieve if a certain threshold is exceeded.
• Does the financial administration analyse audit areas that are highly profitable and draw conclusions from this for strategic management?
CZ: Yes, for example, country-wide tests are carried out with regard to risky goods and sectors.
Germany: There are no regulations at federal level.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level do not provide information on particularly "prolific" audit areas for auditors and UST special examiners.
There were different views on the analysis of such information, the benefits and the way in which it was used.
Some financial directorates provide such information to financial institutions, but they are free to decide whether or not to use it.
4.5.4 Comparison and Evaluation
As a result, large amounts of information are processed automatically in the CZ. Data from UST audits, as well as key figures from balance sheets, profit and loss accounts are processed in the system, among other things.
The CZ is able to control the selection of high-risk cases based on a wide range of information.
The same applies to the evaluation and management of UST tests in general.
In the CZ, the establishment of a special finance office for large enterprises is planned for 2012.
In Germany, the financial administration does not collect comparable amounts of data.
Accordingly, it is more difficult to perform these tasks in the same way.
The emphasis is more on the selection of individual cases.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
On the basis of the information provided in UST pre-filings or VAT declarations as well as test notes, qualified examiners select the cases to be examined and ensure the correct taxation.
In order to reduce revenue losses at the UST and at the same time increase the risk of being discovered for unreliable entrepreneurs, appropriate management processes and risk management systems must be introduced.

5. Conclusions
The cooperation between the two courts of auditors has proved successful.
Thus, necessary knowledge could be gained on the systems applied in both countries: This applies in particular to: • intra-Community sales, • risk management in the VAT system, in particular with regard to the selection of high-risk transactions, • recovery of VAT receivables and • VAT audit of large companies.
The audit revealed differences in the strategies for detecting VAT fraud and the systems outlined above.
This knowledge can be used to improve existing procedures.
They can also be used to stimulate a discussion among interested parties about the approaches and strategies that can be used to combat fraud, such as the relationship between Member States and the European Commission.
The experience and knowledge gained should encourage the joint examination of the administration of the UST in the future.

From pure fruit growing to ecology
A gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle celebrated the 125th anniversary of the district association for horticulture and regional care.
On 29 September 1893, the last impulses for the founding of the district association for horticulture and regional care Kulmbach were put on display at the Kulmbach club house with a fruit show, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a great anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbach town hall.
At the time, of course, it was called "Kulmbach Stadt und Land" (Kulmbach Town and Country District Building Society), which was launched by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.

The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district also left district manager and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun in no doubt.
He led the many visitors through the long history of the district association with a lecture and reported, among other things, on the necessity of self-sufficiency after the war.

Report on the results of the parallel review of the management of the turnover tax of the Czech Republic and Germany
Preface
The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, emphasizes that the courts of auditors are entitled to examine the entire public finances.
The declaration requires the courts of auditors to have the power to scrutinise the tax collection as much as possible.
The Organization of the European Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxes an important part of public revenue.
The thematic focus of the 6th EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the auditing of public revenues by the courts of auditors.
One of the most important steps towards optimising the audit work of the Court of Auditors is to develop a specific strategy for auditing public revenue.
This is particularly true of taxes as the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of default.
As the national economies become increasingly interconnected and interdependent, a situation may arise in which the national auditors can only carry out their audit work in cooperation with the auditors of other States.
The test of internationally organised fraud, which can lead to significant losses of income in many countries, can be considered as an example.
Cooperation between the authorities is required in the fight against such crimes.
Auditing bodies in this area must be prepared to work closely together.
The idea of auditing the turnover tax and the MIAS system came up at the 6th EUROSAI Congress in Bonn, which was carried out in cooperation with the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Audit Office.
In the course of a thorough preparation, the participating courts had to first familiarise themselves with the legal framework and procedures of the sales tax administration in the Czech Republic and in Germany.
Based on the analysis of the available information, we selected the subjects for the examination planning.
Achieving effective and effective management of VAT is a long-standing problem, and individual states (in particular the EC Member States) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify the collection of VAT and create greater transparency in this area.
We are convinced that the results of our audit will not only improve the work of the financial administration, but also provide the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international exchange of information.
Report on the results of the parallel review of the management of the turnover tax of the Czech Republic and Germany
Introduction
Reference number: CZ) 06 / 27 (DE) VIII 2 - 2005 - 1215
Subject of examination:
(CZ) Management of sales tax after the Czech Republic's accession to the European Union
(De) Examination of administrative cooperation in the field of VAT in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and 1925 / 2004
The Commission's audit objective:
(CZ) The purpose of the examination in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedures applied by the tax administration in the area of turnover tax, following the integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter "EC") with the free movement of goods and services and the use of MIAS1, in particular the control of the application of the VAT exemption for intra-Community supplies.
(De) The aim of the audit was to examine the system of intra-Community VAT control with a focus on mutual assistance in the area of VAT in accordance with the above-mentioned regulations.
As a result of the audit, weaknesses should be identified and recommendations made to remedy them.
VAT Information Exchange System The audits were carried out on the basis of an agreement concluded on 8 June 2006 by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic ("NK") and the Federal Court of Justice ("BRH") of the Federal Republic of Germany.
The focus of the cooperation was the review of selected business transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the utilization of information obtained through international administrative assistance between the financial administrations and the comparison of the turnover tax management systems in the two states.
A joint final report on the results of the tests was prepared within the meaning of European guideline 31 for the implementation of the INTOSAI test standards.
The audited period covered the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005.

The parallel audit of the sales tax administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two courts.
In addition to the focus on "exchange of information" in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and the Commission in 1925 / 2004, other closely related aspects have also been examined, such as the registration of tax collectors, tax returns and summary reports.
In addition, the audit also covered the legal situation for cross-border passenger transport by buses and the comparison of statistics.
When comparing the systems of VAT administrations in the two states, differences were found in the following areas:
1) Registration for VAT purposes.
Whereas in Germany, entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among others, the essential criterion for registration is exceeding the VAT threshold set by the VAT law.
In the Czech Republic, tax collectors receive only one tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, the tax collector receives a tax number valid only for domestic transactions for the purposes of sales tax.
If the German tax collector wants to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must apply for a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID number.
As there are problems with the different registration procedures, the rules should be standardised within the EC (see 4.1).
2) Cross-border passenger transport by bus.
In the Czech Republic, the cross-border carriage of passengers by buses is exempt from VAT, but there is a right to deduct VAT.
In Germany, if the route passes through Germany, the transport service is subject to turnover tax.
Efforts should be made at the EC level to standardise the situation in accordance with Article 393 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common turnover tax system (see 4.2).
3) Tax returns.
Whereas in the Czech Republic, tax collectors only have to file VAT returns for periods of under-age taxation (month or quarter), tax collectors in Germany have tax returns (monthly or quarterly).
Pre-registration of sales tax and after the end of the calendar year a declaration of the annual turnover tax.
In contrast to the Czech Republic, tax collectors in Germany are required to submit pre-tax VAT declarations by electronic means.
The introduction of the electronic tax declaration system in the Czech Republic would improve the effectiveness of the Czech tax administration (see 4.3).
4) Summary messages.
While tax collectors in the Czech Republic are required to submit their Comprehensive Reports to the tax authorities, German tax collectors are required to submit the Comprehensive Reports to the CLO2.
Accordingly, the information from the Comprehensive Notices will be available immediately after filing them in the Czech Republic.
The information from the Comprehensive Notices will only be available to German consumers after their processing by the CLO.
In order to combat VAT fraud, updated information on intra-Community transactions is required as soon as possible.
The monthly submission of summary reports would shorten the period between the time of turnover and the update of MIAS data.
This would allow a timely assessment of taxation in the purchaser's Member State (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduce the same deadlines.
5) International exchange of information in the field of sales tax.
For incoming requests for information, the Czech CLO will monitor compliance with the three-month period.
The German CLO does not monitor the processing times.
As a result, the German financial administration has completed a significantly lower percentage of requests for information received within the prescribed period.
Due to these problems, the BRH has recommended to the German CLO a continuous monitoring of the deadlines (see 4.6).
6) Risk management.
Each of the two Member States is developing its own risk management system (RMS) with appropriate strengths and weaknesses.
The NCA and BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by a Member State alone.
Successful criteria, elements or approaches of an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EC Member States. Otherwise, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5.).
Within the framework of the cooperation, the two courts of auditors examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions, which were carried out between Czech and German tax entities.
Of these, 31 cases were jointly investigated using the legal possibilities of the CLO, in which there were doubts about the correct taxation or the suspicion of VAT fraud.
The Court of Auditors found that:
In some cases, the tax authorities made use of the information obtained during the international exchange of information and re-established the value added tax liability of the persons concerned.
In these cases, the tax collectors had either unlawfully claimed the VAT exemption or not declared the purchase of goods in their VAT declaration.
In some cases, people could not use the information obtained during the exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used because of different legal requirements in the two Member States.
In some cases, the financial administration of another Member State refused to provide information.
Some cases have been uncovered in which tax collectors have shown inaccurate sales in their summary reports.
As a result, the data in MIAS were correspondingly erroneous, so that the clerks (the case manager) had to investigate in these cases (see 6).
Examination procedure
Testing in the CR
The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by Department II - "State Budget Revenue" and the regional audit departments of Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.
The audited bodies were: The Ministry of Finance and the 10 departments Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadaň, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Třinec.
The College of the NCP approved the findings of the audit on 23 April 2007.
Examination procedures in Germany
The audit was carried out between July 2006 and February 2007 in the field of traffic taxes and employees of the associated PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt / Main and Munich.
It was part of the work plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006.
After a trial phase, the actual testing started in the fourth quarter of 2006.
According to the cases selected by the BRH and later by the NK, the BRH had to announce the examination in several federal states.
Apart from interviews in the BMF and the CLO, the test was carried out in the following federal states:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
Tax files from the following cases have been included in the audit:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, Munich corporations, Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nord and Hamburg for large companies, Hanover-Nord, Winsen-Luhe, Bonn-Innenstadt, Cologne-Aug.
In addition, discussions were held with the City of Augsburg, Aurich, Düsseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.
The results were reported to the BMF in May 2007.
Cooperation between the two courts
In the run-up to the parallel audit, several meetings were held between representatives of both audit bodies.
The participants in these meetings became familiar with the organisation of the financial administration, the legislation on VAT and the system of the VAT administration in each other country.
The subject of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006.
The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.
At this meeting, a timetable for further proceedings was drawn up and the following examination topics for parallel examinations were determined: 1.
Registration of tax collectors.
2.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus - legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.
3. International exchange of information, in particular the actions of the financial officers in the processing of requests for information and the verification of selected problems mentioned in the requests for information, as well as spontaneous information between the Czech Republic and Germany.
4. Tax returns.
5.
Summary messages.
6.
Statistical information on deliveries and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany.
7. Risk management in the area of sales tax.
At a meeting in December 2006 to coordinate the further examination of the NK and BRH, both sides familiarised themselves with the examination procedure in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of the parallel tests that have already been achieved.

An entrepreneur with legal domicile, registered office or establishment in the Czech Republic, whose turnover in the last 12 consecutive calendar months exceeds the amount of CZK 1 000 000, will be paid on the first day of the third month after the month in which he has crossed the threshold (Section 94 (1) of Law No. 235 / 2004 Coll., concerning VAT; hereinafter "Law No. 235 / 2004").
The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he / she has exceeded the registration threshold.
The current legislation does not allow the retroactive registration of tax collectors if they have exceeded the application deadline for registration.
An entrepreneur with legal domicile, registered office or establishment in the Czech Republic, who provides services exempt from VAT or VAT with the right to deduct VAT, must register for VAT even if his turnover does not exceed CZK 1 million, but he meets other requirements mentioned in Law No. 235 / 2004.
An entrepreneur with legal domicile, registered office or establishment in the Czech Republic, who does not meet any of the requirements set out in the law, can voluntarily apply for VAT registration.
The registration procedure according to Law No. 337 / 1992 begins with the receipt of the application from the local financial officer responsible for registration.
If you want to register voluntarily for VAT, you must specify in your application the date on which you apply for registration as a VAT collector.
The financial officer must check the information provided by the entrepreneur, i.e. the completed application for registration with all investments.
If he has doubts about the information given in it, he must ask the applicant to explain, supplement or prove the information provided.
If, by verification, the financial officer has established that the entrepreneur meets the requirements for registration, he must issue a written notice of registration and the allocation of a tax number.
In the notice, the financial officer must indicate the date of entry into force of the VAT registration and the period of assessment for the VAT.
The period of disposition is the calendar quarter, unless the turnover of the entrepreneur for the previous calendar year has reached the amount of at least CZK 10 million.
If this is the case, the period of disposition is the calendar month.
An entrepreneur whose turnover reached at least CZK 2 000 000 in the preceding calendar year is entitled to choose the calendar month as the accounting period and to inform the financial officer of this change.
The issue of a tax number in the registration notice is always constitutive.
The tax collector must provide the tax number for each communication (including payments) with the tax officer, in addition, in cases where a specific law requires it (e.g. Law No. 235 / 2004, concerning the preparation of tax documents) 3.
The tax number contains the coding "CZ" and a basic component in the form of a general identification mark.
In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or another general identification mark, as determined by a specific law. In the case of legal entities, the general identification mark is the company identification number (in accordance with the provisions of § 33 (12) of Law No. 337 / 1992).
If the entrepreneur has not fulfilled his obligation, despite a request from the financial officer, the local finance officer must register him ex officio.
A notice will also be issued to the person responsible for the tax.
In the Czech Republic, every businessman approved for business operations receives a tax number at his first registration for any type of tax.
This also applies to registration as a VAT payer.
According to Law No. 235 / 2004, which entered into force on January 1, 2005, in the case of non-compliance with the VAT law, the tax officer may require that the taxable person have up to 10% of the revenue from the tax-deductible turnover, which the person concerned has made unlawfully without taxation in 2004, for the period from the date from which the entrepreneur should have been registered as tax collector by the date of registration.
The payment of the fixed amount is considered a tax payment within the meaning of § 98 (3) of Law No. 235 / 2004, i.e. it is not a fine or penalty.
If the legal requirements are met, the registration of a VAT person can be deleted for two reasons:
(1)
Deletion of the registration at the request of the person responsible for the tax, i.e. mainly for the reason that the turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (§ 106 (1) of Law 235 / 2004).
A tax collector can apply for the deletion of his registration at the earliest one year after the date of entry into force mentioned in the registration notice.
2) the deletion of the registration ex officio (§ 106 (7) of Law no. 235 / 2004), if: A) the tax collector failed to perform in the period of 12 consecutive months and did not inform the tax officer of the reasons why, b) the tax collector did not fulfil his obligations according to Law no. 235 / 2004, c) the previous tax officer did not meet the conditions for the tax avoidance.
B) tax collectors without legal domicile, registered office or business premises in the Czech Republic A person who is registered for tax purposes in another Member State and in the Czech Republic does not have legal domicile, place of business or establishment, or a tax-exempt foreigner who provides services in the Czech Republic and who has to make a tax declaration and pay taxes for these services or supplies in accordance with section 108 of the Law no. 235 / 2004 ("non-resident company").
He must file an application for registration with the Prague 1 FA at the latest on the day of the delivery.
In this request, he is entitled to indicate all the VAT Idol allocated to him in other Member States or third countries.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration later than the day of the first tax-deductible provision of services in the Czech Republic, the Prague 1 FA must register him retroactively, since he became subject to VAT according to Law No. 235 / 2004 on the day of the first tax-deductible provision of services in the Czech Republic.
In the case of a retrospective registration, the Prague 1 FA has to demand a certificate (invoices or written explanations) from the operators concerned for the proof of performance.
If a non-resident entrepreneur requests registration in the Czech Republic before the first performance of a service, the Prague 1 FA has to demand the submission of the performance-based contract documents.
As of December 31, 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with the Prague FA 1, of which 124 were from Germany. As of December 31, 2005, a total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered, 233 of whom were from Germany.
In accordance with the provisions of § 106 (9) of Law 235 / 2004, the tax officer is authorised to delete the registration of a non-resident businessman on 31 January of the following calendar year if he does not accept the obligation to file tax filings or declarations and to pay tax.
When examining the NICK, it turned out that in the case of the submission of a tax return by mail with dispatch abroad on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the mandatory deadline for the submission of a tax return, this declaration had not yet been received by the FA until 31 January.
In cases where these facts, which are relevant to the possibility of cancelling the registration, become known to the FA later than 31 January, it is no longer possible to delete the registration of the non-resident businessman for VAT in the Czech Republic in the calendar year in question.
Registration of tax collectors in Germany
According to the provisions of the tax regulation (§ 137, 138 AO), every business must be registered with the municipality and / or the competent tax office.
This application must be made at the latest one month after commencement of business.
The municipality forwards the registration to the tax authorities.
If the competent tax office determines that a business activity has been commenced but has not been notified, it may also register the tax collector retroactively.
Tax collectors in Germany, regardless of whether they are resident or non-resident, are liable to the registration of Zwekke for VAT if they fulfil the requirements of Section 2 of the German VAT Act (VAT Act).
This does not depend on the amount of turnover achieved.
There is no voluntary registration in Germany.
Foreign-based entrepreneurs are responsible for special requirements.
For example, FA ChemnitzSüd is responsible for those entrepreneurs who are based in the Czech Republic.
As of 30 April 2004, there were a total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs registered there; 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered there as of 1 March 2006.
According to the BRH, these individuals with special responsibilities repeatedly refused the registration of so-called false self-employed persons residing in the new Central and Eastern European member states of the EC.
Since the free movement of workers is still restricted after the accession of these ten countries to the European Union, these self-employed people tried to avoid these restrictions by setting up their own business.
These (appearance) self-employed persons do not fulfil the requirements of § 2 UStG for recognition as entrepreneurs, since they usually depend on a single client, who determines their working hours and the type of work they perform.
In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must fill in a questionnaire from the competent FA and provide information on the company and the business carried out.
The questionnaire is a binding form for all people in Germany.
It will be processed either in specific organizational units within the organization or in the organizational units that are generally responsible for tax claims.
With the help of this pressure, a risk assessment for the individual tax collector is carried out before the allocation of a tax number.
The establishment of the tax number for domestic transactions is based on certain requirements:
The first three digits are the identification number for the competent FA, the following three (or four) digits indicate which department is responsible within the FA, the following five (or four) digits are the identifier for the tax collector, the last digit is always a check digit.
If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-Community trade, he needs a VAT ID to be able to make tax-free intra-Community deliveries.
This will be allocated by the CLO on request if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany for sales tax purposes.
The VAT ID number is automatically allocated by the CLO when the tax collector declares intra-Community deliveries in his VAT pre-registration or in his VAT annual declaration.
The USt IdNr. consists of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.
The registration of an entrepreneur can be deleted: 1. On request (for example, if he ceases to do business), but only after the completion of all tax procedures (accounting for all financial years) or 2. If the financial administration determines that he is no longer in business.
As a rule, the validity of the VAT ID number depends on the validity of the VAT number.
In such cases, Fähr must notify the CLO of the deletion of the VAT number so that the validity of the VAT ID number can be terminated at that time.
According to the VAT Act (§ 19 (1) UStG), domestic tax collectors do not have to pay VAT in the following cases: 1. The turnover of the previous calendar year plus the turnover tax incurred on it did not exceed €17,500 and 2. The amount of €50,000 will probably not be exceeded in the following year.
The so-called small business owners are not entitled to charge VAT to other entrepreneurs, nor are they entitled to deduct VAT.
Although they do not have to pay sales tax, small business owners are required to register with the tax office and make an annual VAT return.
A small business owner can explain the non-application of § 19 (1) UStG.
This declaration is binding for the next five years.
He may then charge the sales tax and deduct the pretax.
Non-resident tax collectors can appoint a fiscal representative (§ 22a UStG).
The prerequisite for this is that they exclusively carry out tax-free transactions and waive the deduction of input tax.
The fiscal representative meets the tax requirements of the foreign entrepreneur, so he does not have to register for VAT purposes.
The invoices state that a fiscal representative has been appointed.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation in the two states is different.
Whereas in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first requirement for registration (among others) is to exceed the threshold specified in the VAT law.
If an entrepreneur does not cross this threshold, he can register voluntarily.
The registration procedure in Germany is standardised, but differences can occur due to different organizational structures in the individual federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the tax collector receives a tax number at the time of his first registration for any tax.
In the case of its registration for VAT, this tax number also applies to intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, an entrepreneur who registers for sales tax purposes receives a tax number exclusively for domestic German sales.
If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must specifically apply for the allocation of a VAT ID number.
Both the NCA and the BRH noted that the German two-tier registration system in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which has a single identification number for both national VAT registration and intra-Community transactions, can lead to significant misunderstandings.
On the other hand, the two-tier system allows for retroactive registration (national registration) in cases where the tax collector does not register his business with the municipality or the competent FA.
This retroactive registration allows for a true tendency to value added tax for previous accounting periods, in particular an accurate estimate of the value added tax debt.
Since the different registration procedures cause problems, the rules should be standardised throughout the EC.
The German parliament recently approved the introduction of a tax identification number.
This is to be allocated by the Federal Central Tax Office to each natural person after birth.
This number applies to natural persons residing in Germany for life.
If a natural person takes up a business, the competent FA applies for a commercial tax identification number, which serves as the VAT ID number.
In the future, therefore, there should be no delay between the national registration of a tax collector and the allocation of the VAT ID number.
Work has not yet been completed on the implementation of an IT procedure for managing the numbers.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus
Legislation in the Czech Republic
According to the provisions of Section 70 of Law 235 / 2004, since 1 May 2004 the carriage of passengers between individual Member States and between Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic has been exempt from VAT and there is a right to deduct VAT.
The exemption from VAT also applies if the carriage of persons registered as tax collectors in other Member States or foreigners who are domestically taxable is carried out.
The return journey is considered to be a separate carriage.
If non-resident operators in the Czech Republic carry out no economic activity other than the cross-border carriage of passengers by bus, they are not entitled to be registered in the Czech Republic as subject to turnover tax.
Cross-border passenger transport in the Czech Republic has been exempted from VAT in accordance with the Act on the accession of the Czech Republic, Annex V, Chapter 5 (1) (b), which states:
"For the purpose of applying Article 28 (3) (b) of Directive 77 / 388 / EEC, the Czech Republic may, in accordance with Article 17 of Annex F of the Directive, maintain the exemption for cross-border transport of persons until the condition of Article 28 (4) of the Directive is fulfilled or as long as the same exemption is applied by any of the current Member States."
The legal regulations in Germany
According to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006, as implemented in Germany by section 3b (1) of the UStG, a transport service is carried out where the carriage is effected.
Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and cross-border passenger transport.
Only the domestic part of the transport service is subject to tax in Germany.
German taxation also does not distinguish between resident and non-resident (bus) operators.
If a non-resident tax collector transports persons through Germany, the part of the carriage that falls on Germany is considered to be a tax-deductible carriage.
Before providing his services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must report his intention to provide passenger transport services to the relevant FA.
It registers it for tax purposes (compare 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for each bus named in the tax registration.
The entrepreneur must state his tax-deductible transport services in a German VAT declaration.
As of 1 March 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered with the Chemnitz South FA.
If the transport service is provided for a domestic entrepreneur, the non-resident tax collector does not have to pay the VAT himself to the FA.
In its place, the domestic buyer of the services must pay the VAT to the tax office and the net amount charged to the non-resident taxpayer, which is referred to as the "transfer of tax liability" and is in accordance with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC.
In addition to the registration by a non-resident tax collector and his income tax return, the German financial administration has several means of verifying the accuracy of the tax return with regard to tax-deductible transport of persons:
Mobile control groups of the customs check the certificates of buses registered abroad, which are used for the transport of passengers through Germany.
After each inspection, the mobile control groups send an inspection report to the competent FA.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group can require the bus driver to pay VAT before continuing his journey.
The non-resident tax collector can deduct the value added tax thus paid from the tax debt indicated in his VAT return.
If the FA has doubts about the accuracy of a VAT declaration, it can order an examination to take place in the FA, or it can use the means of mutual assistance mentioned in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 (see point 4.6).
Even if the foreign tax collector refuses to pay the legally established VAT, the FA may ask for mutual assistance in accordance with Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC.
The BRH considers these means of mutual assistance in tax matters for the verification of the VAT declaration or compliance with the tax rules by a non-resident bus operator to be too costly in relation to the small amount of turnover tax on tax-deductible passenger transport.
In particular, the auditing of the books of a non-resident tax collector costs disproportionately for the tax collector himself and for the financial administration.
The latter must check foreign books, which requires knowledge not only of the foreign language, but also of foreign accounting principles.
Accordingly, such an examination will require more time than a resident tax collector, although the examination will be limited to the transport of persons in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident tax collector must accept not only the audit rights of his national financial administration, but also those of the other Member States, as far as he carries out personal transport there.
In addition, for each Member State in which a single transport of persons is carried out, the tax collector must comply with all existing tax rules in the various languages and on the forms of the financial administrations of the EC Member States concerned.
Thus, the correct taxation of cross-border passenger transport services leads to a disproportionate administrative burden.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation is different in the two states.
In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between different EC Member States and between Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT under the law on the Czech Republic's accession to the EU.
In Germany, transport services are subject to a turnover tax in accordance with the route covered by the German territory.
If a non-resident tax collector provides such a service for the first time, he must first report it to the competent FA.
This registers the tax collector, who has to declare the tax-deductible portion of the transport performance in a tax declaration in Germany.
Law enforcement in Germany is very time-consuming.
At least three out of four Czech tax collectors registered with the Chemnitz-South FA have the transport of persons as a business purpose.
The amount of tax in question is quite low in relation to the administrative burden.
The Member States - which collect the turnover tax in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common VAT system - have a high administrative burden in relation to the relevant tax revenue.
In order to avoid the disproportionate cost of VAT, cross-border transport of passengers should only be subject to tax in one Member State.
This could be the state where the transport starts or where the service provider resides.
Such a type of taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006.
Sales tax returns
Filing and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic
Unless the law specifies otherwise, even if no tax debt has been incurred, the entrepreneur is contracted to file a VAT return on the form provided by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days after the expiration of the tax period.
The tax liability arises at the end of the period for filing the VAT return. The exception to this rule is the VAT on the import of goods according to law 235 / 2004, where the due date of the tax is determined by the customs regulations.
If, as a result of higher-than-average deductible taxes, there is a claim for a refund, this amount will be refunded to the person responsible for the tax within 30 days after fixing this deduction, without the need to make an application.
The deadline is not applied in cases where the tax officer initiates a tax procedure with regard to the tax debt of the person liable for the tax.
Pursuant to section 73 (11) of Law 235 / 2004, the claim for deduction can be asserted at the latest with the regular tax return for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the claim for deduction was made.
After the expiration of this period, the deduction can still be claimed within three years after the end of the tax period, in which the claim would have been possible for the first time.
For this, however, it is necessary to present a supplementary VAT declaration.
An amendment to Law No. 235 / 2004, which came into force on 1 January 2005, allows the filing of a supplementary VAT return only for the period in which the claim for deduction of VAT could have been made for the first time.
A tax collector must make a supplementary VAT declaration if: (A) the sum of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax debt, (b) he makes corrections which do not change the last known tax debt, but only change the previous information, (c) he makes adjustments to the VAT rate and the tax liability in accordance with section 49 of Law No. 235 / 2004.
A tax collector can make a supplementary VAT declaration if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax liability.
The tax collector must submit the supplementary tax return by the end of the month following the month in which the relevant facts were established.
The sales tax declaration can be made electronically either on the Internet or via data carriers.
Internet delivery can take place with or without a certified electronic signature.
If it is done without an electronic signature, it must also be submitted on a data carrier.
The form for the VAT declaration contains separate lines for the indication of the value of intra-Community deliveries and purchases.
The value of related services must be specified in separate lines of the VAT return.
Some categories are used for automated primary checks within the ATIS system.
The value of the goods delivered in other EC Member States to persons registered there as tax-compliant is compared with the data indicated by the Czech tax collectors in their Comprehensive Reports.
The value of purchases of goods from other Member States by persons registered there as tax-compliant is compared with the information in the Comprehensive Reports of tax collectors from other EC Member States by means of the MIAS.
Within the framework of the ATIS system, the FA undertakes a credibility check of the VAT returns.
This takes place automatically, since the VAT declaration cannot be processed without the prior inspection.
The credibility test includes a calculation of the standards of credibility and an assessment of the risks of VAT returns.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 37 (1) of Law No. 337 / 1992, the FA may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who fail to comply with their non-monetary obligations under this or a specific tax law or decision under this law.
Automated tax information system - Automated tax information system used by the Czech tax authorities to provide technical support for tax collection.
The NCA found in its audit that the tax authorities rarely made use of the possibility of imposing a fine on the tax person in question if the VAT declaration was not issued.
Filing and processing of VAT returns in Germany
In Germany, a distinction is made between the monthly or quarterly VAT pre-registration and the annual VAT declaration.
Those tax collectors who are licensed to submit VAT pre-registration must nevertheless make an annual VAT return.
Even small business owners who are not contracted to pay VAT will have to make an annual VAT return.
Tax collectors are in principle required to file a sales tax notice by the 10th day after the end of the calendar quarter in which the sales tax is incurred (§ 18 (2) UStG).
However, if the VAT debt amounted to more than €6,136 in the previous year, or if it is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur is required to submit monthly pre-tax declarations by the 10th day after the expiration of the respective month at the latest.
The person paying the tax can also opt for the payment of monthly VAT pre-registration if he has been refunded more than €6,136 in the previous year (§ 18 (2a) UStG).
If the annual turnover tax is not more than €512, neither VAT pre-registration nor VAT returns have to be made.
A resulting value-added tax debt must be paid 10 days after the end of the tax period.
A refund can lead to a more thorough audit by the financial administration.
(Legal) deadlines for the processing of VAT returns and for the refund of VAT overpayments do not exist.
In order to obtain a timely refund, a security can be offered for the refund amount.
In principle, VAT returns, including refund cases, must be processed quickly.
The German VAT Act allows for an extension of these (surrender or payment) deadlines (§ 18 (6) UStG).
The extension of the deadline must be requested separately.
If it is granted, the VAT pre-registration and the corresponding payments may be made one month later. However, in the case of monthly reports, a special advance payment has to be made.
This payment will be calculated against the VAT debt established for the pre-registration period in December.
If an error is discovered, the entrepreneur must make a corrected VAT declaration.
There is no "supplementary" VAT declaration.
Once the VAT declaration to be submitted by 31 May of the following year has been submitted to the tax office, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect VAT declaration, but only the incorrect annual VAT declaration.
Correction of this VAT declaration to the advantage or disadvantage of the person responsible for the tax is possible within four years after the expiration of the year in which the first VAT declaration was made.
After the expiration of this four-year period, a VAT declaration can usually only be corrected in cases of careless tax reduction or tax evasion.
Tax collectors must submit pre-tax declarations by electronic means.
The pledges can grant exceptions to this rule in order to avoid undue hardship.
The annual VAT declaration can be made in paper form or via the Internet with or without certification.
If the submission takes place without certification, the tax collector must make the declaration on paper and with his / her personal signature.
If no VAT declarations or declarations are made, the tax administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the turnover achieved by the tax collective6.
In the case of late payment, a delay surcharge can be imposed on the tax payer (up to 10% of the tax liability or up to €25,000).
In an earlier investigation, the BRH found that the airlines often do not charge this delay surcharge.
In the cases where the fees are collected, the amount is fixed in an inconsistent and arbitrary manner.
The delay surcharge therefore misses its purpose of reducing the average delay, in particular in the submission of the annual VAT declaration.
The form of the VAT declaration contains separate lines for value information on intra-Community deliveries or purchases.
There are also separate lines for the provision of services.
Non-taxable transactions are to be specified in a separate line of the VAT declaration.
The VAT returns submitted on paper must either be scanned or electronically recorded by specially appointed personnel.
The data of electronically submitted tax returns are immediately available to the financial administration.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
After all data is electronically recorded, they are subjected to a risk management procedure and a case selection is made based on certain criteria.
The VAT returns selected in this way must be checked by the responsible clerk on the basis of the test notes drawn up automatically (see 5.2).
Although the financial administration only has to make a rough estimate of the turnover tax debt, it still has to be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, tax collectors must file their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the end of the tax period.
Depending on the turnover of the taxable person, the tax period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
In Germany, tax collectors have to file their advance applications at the latest 10 days after either the end of the calendar quarter or the calendar month, depending on the amount of their tax debt of the previous year.
The annual declaration of VAT must be made by 31 May of the following year at the latest.
The requirement to submit an annual VAT return has several advantages and disadvantages:
+ After the end of the calendar year, the tax collector can correct the errors in the monthly pre-registration by submitting a single VAT return;
- if the tax collector reports his information on intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be attributed to a specific ZM reporting period;
- The federal states do not share MIAS data on intra-Community purchases of German taxpayers until the annual VAT declarations have usually been processed.
According to the registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs must make a VAT declaration regardless of the amount of their turnover.
This levy will enable the German financial administration to check the compliance with the turnover ceiling for small business owners.
In addition, the competent FA can adjust the annual VAT declaration with the corresponding declarations for direct taxes and with the annual accounts of the company in question.
In the Czech Republic, the financial administration can only check the amount of the turnover on the basis of the income tax declaration.
Contrary to the regulations in force in the Czech Republic, German tax collectors are liable for the electronic submission of the VAT pre-registration.
The introduction of the electronic tax declaration system in the Czech Republic would increase the effectiveness of the Czech tax administration.
Summary notices
Submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic
In accordance with the provisions of Section 102 of Law 235 / 2004, an entrepreneur who supplies goods to a person registered in another Member State for tax purposes is required to make such summary declarations (hereinafter "ZM").
The value of the delivered goods is always given in Czech currency in the ZM, according to the VAT IdNr7, the individual tax collectors under which they are registered in the other Member State.
Information on services is not provided in the ZM.
The taxable persons with a calendar monthly or quarterly period of taxation have to hand over the ZM to the local FA at the latest on the 25th day after the expiration of each quarter.
Incorrect data must be corrected in a correction ZM within 15 days after the error has been detected.
Erroneous data in the ZM are always replaced by data from the correction ZM.
Similar to tax returns, tax collectors can also submit the ZM electronically.
If a tax collector does not issue a ZM or correction ZM, even though it is provided for by law no. 235 / 2004, the financial officer must ask him to surrender the ZM in question and assign it to the consequences of the non-payment. In the case of non-monetary claims, the financial officer is authorised to repeatedly impose fines of up to 2 million CZK, in accordance with section 37 of Law No 337 / 1992.
The NICK found in its audit that the tax authorities mostly did not use their power to impose fines against their defaulting taxpayers.
In particular, the tax collectors are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations when submitting the ZM, since the omitted payment of an ZM does not affect the amount of their VAT debt.
Pursuant to section 102 (5) of Law 235 / 2004, the financial officer is required to check the information in the ZM or the correction ZM, to remove all ambiguity and to use the information to fix the tax debt.
In case of disagreement
8 of the information in the ZM with which the taxman corrects false information in the ZM by submitting a correction ZM either on his own initiative or on request.
The financial officer has to correct the data on deliveries of goods to other Member States in the ATIS system, if:
- the tax officer does not prove the accuracy of the information reported in the ZM (or correction ZM) and therefore corrects it by submitting a correction ZM,
- the financial officer has proved the inaccuracy of the information reported by the taxman in the ZM or the correction ZM.
The correction received by the financial officer, without a correction ZM being made by the tax officer, does not replace the tax inspector's right to make a correction ZM, but only leads to the correction of the data in the MIAS, so that it is current, complete and accurate.
The ZM data will be sent to the Member States concerned.
Only the national financial authority designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the field of turnover tax may transmit and receive this data.
This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic this function is performed by the Department of International Mutual Assistance in the field of VAT in the Ministry of Finance) and the message "O _ MCTL" automatically receives the CLO from the other Member States.
It contains all incorrect USt-IdNr., which were specified in the transmitted ZM lines.
If the incorrect VAT ID number is used in some of the transmitted lines of the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry will be made in the wrong VAT ID list.
The list contains a "report of doubts regarding UST IdNr."
The financial officer checks the data and enters the result of the review into the system.
When purchasing goods from another Member State, the tax collector must indicate this in his VAT declaration and enter the value of the acquisition in the specified value-added tax return.
Selected cases of differences between the value of purchases made by the Czech tax payer in his VAT declaration and the value of goods delivered by the supplier from the other Member State in his ZM will be forwarded by the CLO to the competent FA for examination.
The clerks there must investigate the discrepancies.
Three different situations can occur:
A) The value indicated by the Czech purchaser in the relevant categories of its VAT declaration is lower than the value of the deliveries indicated by suppliers from other EC Member States.
In this case, the financial officer will check the accuracy of the information.
B) The difference is zero.
This situation may result either from a change in the information within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects its ZM) or from a change in the information in the VAT declaration (the Czech tax collector in the meantime makes a supplementary VAT declaration on his own initiative).
In this case, it is at the discretion of the financial officer to check the accuracy of the information in the VAT declaration.
C) The value of the goods purchased from other Member States, which the Czech tax collector has indicated in his VAT declaration, is higher than the value of the shipments reported by suppliers of the other EC Member States.
Again, it is at the discretion of the financial officer to check the accuracy of the information.
After reviewing the differences and clarifying the reasons for their occurrence, the finance officer enters the results of his review into ATIS.
These results will be transmitted to the CLO.
The number of transactions sent by the CLO for inspection can be seen in graph No. 1 (source: Czech Ministry of Finance) for the various quarters of 2005.
Graph 1 above shows that the number of cases reported by the CLO has decreased for the different quarters of 2005.
The significant reduction in the number of cases in the 4th quarter of 2005 is due, among other things, to the fact that the Czech CLO has raised the threshold for the selection of cases to the other EC Member States, taking into account the minimum amount limit for requests for information.
Deviations between the information in the VAT returns and the data from the EC do not always have to be based on a mistake on the part of the national purchaser.
There may also be an error by the taxman in another Member State, or an error caused by the fact that certain types of supplies are indicated differently in the ZM in the different EC Member States.
The most common reasons for deviations in the value of reported transactions identified in the audited cases can be seen in Table 1.
Submission and processing of Comprehensive Notices in Germany
Operators who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EC Member States or take part in triangular transactions are required to submit quarterly ZM, which lists intra-Community deliveries to purchasers (§ 18a (1) UStG).
The ZM must be delivered no later than the 10th day of the month following the calendar quarter concerned.
If a long-term extension is granted for the submission of sales tax pre-applications, this also applies to the ZM.
The ZM must be handed over to the CLO.
Since 1 January 2007, the electronic levy has been phased out.
The competent FA can allow exemptions for individual tax dodgers in order to avoid undue hardship.
If the person in charge of the tax notices that the ZM was defective, he is liable to make a correction ZM within one month.
In the case of non-payment of the ZM, the CLO initiates an enforcement procedure.
This includes the following steps: - first reminder - second reminder, together with the threat of a penalty payment being set and - fixing the penalty.
Although the German tax code allows a penalty of up to €25,000 (Section 329 AO) to be set, the CLO imposes fines of €125, 250 and 500 in three stages.
In addition, § 26a (1) No. 5 UStG specifies that the person liable to tax acts contrary to the law if he or she intentionally or recklessly fails to deliver a ZM correctly, completely or on time, or if he or she fails to correct an ZM in time.
This infringement can be punished with a fine of up to €5,000.
Data on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered into the MIAS by the companies, because the CLO is exclusively responsible for processing the ZM.
The ZM data is only stored by the CLO.
The information from the Comprehensive Notices will only be available to the Fähr after their processing by the CLO.
The deadlines for processing ZM are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003.
ZM data must be stored within three months of the calendar quarter (in MIAS).
In the case of incorrect VAT number in the ZM of German tax collectors, the German CLO receives a message "O _ MCTL" from the other Member State.
The CLO then turns to the entrepreneur and asks for the correct data.
If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case will be referred to the relevant FA.
It is then his job to request the right information.
In the course of its examination, the BRH found that most operators corrected the VAT ID number at the request of the CLO.
However, remembering, threatening and fixing up to three consecutive fines takes too much time when a tax collector may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.
The cases that were ultimately reported to the competent authorities were usually completed within one to two months.
The competent FA refused exemption for the reported intra-Community deliveries in 73% of these expirations9.
If the tax collector presented the correct VAT ID number, the FA asked him to submit a corrected ZM to the CLO, because the tax authorities cannot correct the MIAS data themselves.
The BRH found that neither the FTE nor the CLO controlled the submission of the corrected ZM.
Therefore, the tax collectors often did not comply with the request. Since the CLO does not have access to the data of the VAT returns, there is no comparison of the information given in the VAT estimates or the VAT declaration on the delivery of goods with the corresponding data in the ZM before these data are transmitted to the CLO of the other Member States.
This comparison can only be carried out by the tax authorities, usually during the preparation of a special VAT check.
Data received from other Member States is processed by the CLO.
Incorrect VAT ID numbers are detected and reported to the Member States concerned.
The data will be used for the control of the tax on labour in the Member States.
Once they are available in the system, the CLO compares them with the data from previous calendar quarters.
If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control notices will be drawn up and sent to the competent authorities.
This is done continuously, whereas the acquisition data of all VAT collectors will be compiled later and sent to the tax authorities.
The risk management system (RMS) for the assessment procedure then balances these data with those for intra-Community purchases.
The system completely checks (only) those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct VAT.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, tax collectors who have made intra-Community deliveries to a person registered in another Member State for VAT must submit a ZM to the local FA within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter.
They process the ZM and forward the data to the CLO.
The values of intra-Community deliveries reported by the tax collectors in the ZM are compared with the values of intra-Community deliveries indicated by the same tax collectors in their VAT declarations.
The results of the comparison will be taken into account in the tax setting.
In Germany, tax collectors who have made intra-Community deliveries are liable to surrender quarterly ZM within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter10.
Since 1 January 2007, tax collectors have been required to submit the ZM electronically to the CLO.
The data from the ZM will only be available to the users after its processing by the CLO.
Both in the Czech Republic and in Germany, the tax collectors only specify the deliveries of goods in the ZM.
The provision of services is not specified in the ZM. Unlike the Czech Fähr, the German Fähr cannot correct erroneous information in individual lines of the ZM.
Due to this limited access to the German MIAS data, incorrect VAT ID numbers were not corrected even if the person in charge reported the correct VAT ID number to the FA.
The German financial administration does not compare the information on intra-Community deliveries made by German tax collectors in their VAT pre-registration with the information provided by the relevant ZM.
Differences between the data of the pre-registration and the ZM are regularly not revealed before the German CLO transmits the MIAS data to other Member States.
Based on these findings by the BRH, it is evident that a comparison would improve the reliability of the MIAS data transmitted.
Data provided by other Member States on shipments of goods to Czech tax collectors will be compared in the Czech Republic with data on purchases of goods indicated by Czech tax collectors in their VAT returns.
The Czech CLO makes a separate comparison for each calendar quarter.
The most serious cases of deviation will be sent to the courts for examination.
Unlike the Czech financial administration, the German financial administration does not generally examine the taxation of intra-Community purchases.
Such a general control is only applied to tax collectors who are not fully entitled to deduct VAT.
In addition, the German tax administration controls the taxation of intra-Community purchases of other tax entities only if the RMS has drawn up an audit notice or the person responsible for the tax has already been selected for an audit.
This procedure relieves the pleading from clarifying the reasons for the differences that occur.
On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
In order to combat carousel fraud, updated information on intra-Community purchases must be available as soon as possible.
The current system of the ZM, in particular MIAS, provides the tax authorities with information that may well be half a year old.
This time delay could be reduced to up to four months if the tax collectors had to hand over monthly ZM.
The monthly levy would increase the bureaucratic burden only insignificantly, since most tax collectors in the Czech Republic and Germany are already liable for the submission of monthly VAT returns or pre-filings and for which ZM does not require more information than for VAT returns or preliminary declarations.
In order to avoid red tape, the ZM levy could be linked to the submission of VAT returns or advance declarations.
However, a monthly payment of ZM would cause more periodic discrepancies between the information on intra-Community deliveries and those on intra-Community purchases and increase the data flows between the CLOs.
In 2006, the Federal Government considered the general introduction of monthly ZM.
The implementation failed due to the concerns of the federal states.
They feared that a monthly transfer of MIAS data to the CLO of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In order for the monthly surrender of ZM to be effective, it is necessary to agree on the common monthly levy at European level, so that a monthly update of the MIAS data is possible.
Statistical information on shipments and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany
In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.
The total turnover of intra-community trade between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Table No. 2.
Both courts requested data on the number of false tax numbers or VAT ID number in O _ MCTL messages exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for each of the audited quarters.
These data can be found in the following tables.
They have significant differences.
The reason for the differences may be a different calculation basis for the number of O _ MCTL messages.
While the Czech CLO refers the figures to the calendar quarter for which the ZM was issued, the German CLO refers its figures to the calendar quarter in which the O _ MCTL message was received.
International exchange of information at level 3
International exchange of information in the Czech Republic
International exchange of information allows financial officials to obtain information from other Member States on intra-Community transactions and on the tax entities that have carried them out.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 on mutual assistance in the field of VAT, which repealed Directive (EEC) No 218 / 92 (hereinafter "Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003"), distinguishes between two basic forms of exchange of information: Exchange of information on request and spontaneous exchange of information (without prior request).
International exchange of information on request takes place through a request for information ("request for information RFI") using the standardised SCAC pre-print.
Financial officials in the Czech Republic send their RFI or responses to an RFI obtained through the Finance Directorate to the CLO, which is responsible for translating the information provided in the standardised SCAC form into the foreign language and forwarding it to other Member States.
In addition, the CLO receives requests for information (RFI) from other Member States and replies to requests sent. It obtains their translation into the Czech Republic and distributes them to the competent FEB for processing.
Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 sets a maximum period of three months from receipt of the request for its processing.
All RFIs exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany in the tested period have been checked by the NK.
Out of the total number of 94 RFIs received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were dealt with within the three-month period; in another 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) this period was exceeded.
In the remaining one case, no reply had been sent to Germany until the NK had examined it. More detailed information on the deadlines within which the Czech Republic responded to the requests made by Germany can be found in chart 2.
Out of the total number of 335 requests for information (RFI) received from the Czech Republic to Germany, in 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) received a reply within the three-month period; a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were processed after the expiration of this period and in 19 cases there was currently no answer from Germany to the examination by the NK (in the remaining one case it was not possible to find the answer based on the information).
More detailed information on the deadlines within which the requests for information from the Czech Republic were answered from Germany can be found in graph no. 3.
The percentages of intra-Community transactions indicated in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in graph no. 4.
The graph above shows that the sales audited in connection with requests for information usually had a value of more than €60,000.
International exchange of information without prior request is either automatic, structured or in the form of instant information.
Information is often provided to financial officials in other Member States without any prior request, which is important for fixing the value added tax debt.
In the Czech Republic, all information is collected by the CLO.
The exchange of information between the individual Member States takes place electronically.
According to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003, "automatic exchange" means the systematic transmission of previously defined information to other Member States at regular, predetermined intervals without any prior request.
"Structured automatic exchange" means the systematic transfer of previously defined information to another Member State without its prior request as soon as the information in question is available.
The Czech Republic informs the other Member States in the automatic exchange of information on deliveries of new vehicles.
The financial officer obtains this information from the form of notification of the delivery of a new vehicle in accordance with Section 19 of Law 235 / 2004 and from the copy of the invoice issued.
When processing this form, the financial officer will provide the required data in the document and forward it directly to the responsible representative of the Finance Directorate, where these data will be collected and sent to the CLO for further processing, after which the data will be transmitted to the other Member States within the specified period, at the latest within two months of the end of the quarter in which they were obtained.
The Czech Republic also provides information to other Member States on mail order transactions that are tax-free in the country of origin, intra-Community transactions that appear inadmissible and potential "missing traders."
This information is transmitted to other Member States by means of a SCAC pre-print in a spontaneous exchange of information.
Implementation of international exchange of information in Germany
In Germany, the initiative for information requests and spontaneous exchange of information comes from the local competent FA.
Please send the completed copy of SCAC 2004 by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which will forward the SCACVordrucke to the foreign CLO.
They are instructed to write their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the SCACVordruck used is one-page.
Half of the German requests for information examined by the BRH were sent in order to ensure employment taxation in the other Member State or to prove the tax exemption of the intra-Community supply from Germany to the other Member State.
If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it checks whether the value of the supplies mentioned in the request exceeds the minimum amount of €15,000.
If there is no reasonable reason for the request, the German CLO refuses to provide information regarding a turnover below the minimum amount limit.
In addition, the German CLO provides for the translation of the freely worded texts in the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)] if they are not written in German or English.
In response to the request for information, the CLO will refer the request to the competent FA, referring to the three-month period.
At the various levels of the German financial administration, no further deadlines have been set.
Although the German CLO has the technical means to monitor compliance with the deadline, it does not have the necessary personnel capacity to remind the German CLO of the response to uncompleted requests for information.
You will receive the information you need by writing to the tax agent or conducting an external audit.
External auditors usually choose between two types of assessment: The special VAT check, which covers all tax-related transactions over a period of several months, or the so-called value-added tax check, which may only refer to a recent operation.
With this short and unavoidable form of examination, it is not necessary to make an announcement to the person responsible for the tax and it has proved itself in the investigation of a single turnover.
In the case of automatic exchange of information, Germany sends the following information to the other Member State: - on VAT IdNr., which has been allocated to companies established in other EC Member States; - on the refund of VAT to operators resident in other EC Member States.
In addition, Germany has agreed to provide the following information to the other EC Member States in the context of structured automatic exchange of information:
A. The delivery of new vehicles to entrepreneurs without VAT, e.g. distance sales (mail order) to other EC Member States not subject to VAT in Germany, c. Significant discrepancies between purchases reported by a tax collector and MIAS data transmitted by other Member States, i.e. intra-Community deliveries of items which have been made by the tax collector or which have been inappropriately subjected to taxation in Germany, e. Misappropriation of which has been made by the tax collector, is not valid within the tax system.
Comparison and evaluation
Requests for information or spontaneous information are sent both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the initiative of the local authorities, who send the corresponding SCACVordrucke to the CLO.
While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCACVordrucke (Czech-English) and translates information provided into English or German, the German texts follow the instruction to write requests for information or instant information only in German.
The German CLO does not produce translations of German texts.
When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany in the period 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005, the NCA found that the Czech financial administration completed 74.5% of the requests for information received within the three-month period, while the requests for information made to Germany were only dealt with by the German financial administration in 40.6% of cases within that period.
Although the German CLO points to the three-month period, it does not monitor its adherence.
Due to the absence of reminders, there is a high proportion of requests for information that have been answered in freezing conditions.
For this reason, the BRH has recommended a continuous reminder procedure to the German CLO.
The situation has now changed.
According to the information available to us, the German CLO has meanwhile reminded the tax offices of the answer to the outstanding requests for information.
VAT risk management
Risk management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several organizational units at different levels of financial management are involved in risk management in the area of sales tax.
Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organisational units are responsible for risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:
The department for methodology and economic management of sales tax or its unit for risk management deals with the identification of potential risk areas for tax revenue and evaluates the trends in these risks in domestic and intra-Community trade.
At the national level, this body coordinates the requirements for the criterion of "credibility of VAT returns" and uses the MIAS data to discover possible tax evasion within the framework of intra-Community deliveries and purchases.
Based on data on the trade balance of the Czech Republic, it evaluates high-risk products, prepares the risk management in the area of turnover tax in a conceptual manner and cooperates in this area with the competent EC institutions and the other Member States.
The department for international mutual assistance in the field of VAT provides inter alia for the exchange of information, participates in the creation and implementation of a relevant information database, evaluates the data of other Member States available in the MIAS system, carries out public relations work and is responsible for other forms of intergovernmental assistance within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank

The tax audit and tax investigation department carries out, among other things, risk analyses in the framework of the methodical management of tax audits, defines priorities for the work planning of the financial directorates with regard to the selection of cases to be examined, compiles risk analyses for the fight against tax evasion and, in this context, gathers information from the financial administration and other sources, and makes proposals for measures to combat tax evasion.
Tax Enforcement Services are established by the Finance Directors.Their tasks include the search for tax collectors and sectors that are risky in terms of the frequency of tax evasion (e.g. Internet stores, gold, pharmaceutical industry), the search for unregistered tax collectors (e.g. Internet services, labour mediation, electronic and print media, etc.), the investigation of suspicions in cases of fraud, and the information of local tax authorities.
Special exam units have been set up in 12 selected courses.
These have a regional competence and carry out tax audits outside the local area of jurisdiction of the Fähr on the basis of the corresponding authorisation.
The need to set up the special audit units resulted from the increase in new and "improved" forms of tax evasion, particularly in relation to chain transactions.
These special units examine according to the needs of tax investigators or focus on tax collectors with specific activities, multinational companies and tax collectors with particularly high turnover rates.
The following mechanisms for reducing the risks in the area of turnover tax have been integrated into the ATIS system: - the "credibility of VAT returns" to assess the risk effectiveness of tax returns, - the "selection of the taxable persons to be audited," whereby the taxable persons to be audited are selected on the basis of certain criteria, - the "MIAS" task, which allows financial officials to access the data provided by the other EC Member States.
The task "MIAS" makes possible, among other things, the following: - verification of the validity of the VAT Idn of taxable persons from other Member States, - confirmation of the value of the goods delivered to a Czech tax person, as stated in the ZM of all the suppliers of the tax person in question from other Member States, - preparation of a list of taxable persons who have not submitted the ZM, formal control of the data of the tax person in their tax person from other Member States, the creation of other Member States whose ZM does not appear in the information about the ZM of the ZM.
As part of their mission to combat tax evasion, financial officials have access to data from state agencies such as the Commercial Register, Land Registry Office, Motor Vehicle Registry, Commercial Register, etc.
More detailed information can be found in section 4.4.1 Submission and processing of the Comprehensive Notices in the Czech Republic.
Risk management in Germany
Due to their federal structure, in the Federal Republic of Germany, both the federal financial authorities (in particular the CLO) and the financial administrations of the 16 federal states are involved in the development and introduction of an RMS.
Although there are joint development working groups, neither the CLO nor the financial administrations of the federal states have a complete set of data.
At the level of the CLO, the unit ST I 2 (hereinafter referred to as the "KUSS" - Coordinating Unit for VAT Special Examinations and Tax Enforcement Measures) collects the audit findings on fraud cases in the OPUS database.
In cooperation with the countries, another database called ZAUBER has been set up at the KUSS, where the tax authorities can enter and retrieve the names of discovered missing traders or VAT cheats.
The CUSTOMER coordinates both related cases of VAT fraud at the national level and cases of cross-border VAT fraud.
The experience of the KUSS will be incorporated into the development of the RMS through their collaboration in the working groups.
In addition, experts from several other organizational units of the CLO and the BMF are also involved.
The CLO will carry out a formal review of the composition of VAT No. of other Member States that appear in the ZM of German taxpayers.
This formal review takes place before the ZM is transmitted to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of the MIAS data and thus its usefulness (see 4.4.2).
The validity of the VAT IdNo. referred to in the ZM is tested on the basis of the O _ MCTL identifiers supplied by the other Member States (for the procedure of rectifying invalid VAT Idn., see also 4.4.2).
In addition, the RMS of the CLO is based on the MIAS data transmitted by the other Member States and generates various types of messages on the discovery of suspected Missing Traders. Certain characteristics, which usually occur in carousel transactions, are used as clues.
In certain cases, the federal states are instructed to process these notices and have to report the outcome of their investigations to the CLO.
The BRH audit has confirmed that all available features must be included in order to be sufficiently likely to suggest a case of tax fraud (rather than focusing mainly on a company's turnover).
Accordingly, the BRH has recommended that the BMF work with combinations of different indications in the preparation of the messages.
The risk management system should also take into account other indicators, such as the payment behaviour of the tax payer, the economic sector or the company's shareholding.
A second level of risk management exists in the financial administrations of the federal states and focuses on the processing of sales tax pre-applications and annual declarations.
For example, the system creates a list of tax collectors who have indicated intra-Community deliveries in their VAT estimates or annual declarations.
This list will be sent to the CLO to monitor the full submission of the ZM.
Furthermore, in this type of risk management, the purchases indicated by the tax person in his annual VAT declaration are compared with the data in the MIAS.
The financial administrations of the federal states avoid a comparison of the quarterly data, since it would lead to too many discrepancies, which are due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud; e.g.:
- the supplier and the purchaser assume different times for the execution of the intra-Community turnover;
- different accounting and tax declaration of discounts and discounts.
In addition to comparing the data from the VAT returns with the MIAS data, many German states have certain risk management mechanisms, which are based on information in the VAT returns and certain other indications (e.g. company wording, the age of the owners / partners, the number of employees and the method of payment of the tax credit).
Bavaria has introduced a risk management system based on fixed rules, which allows a team of tax fraud specialists (hereinafter referred to as "risk managers") to program their own rules to identify suspected tax cheats.
This system is used to process VAT estimates.
This will give the competent FA the information of the RMS before the VAT is set.
Since this system is not capable of learning, the risk managers have to adjust the rules according to the feedback from the questions.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has developed an adaptive neural network based on the data of detected cases of deprivation.
Based on this data, the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.
The system compiles a monthly list of tax cases where there is evidence of tax evasion.
On the basis of this list, the competent authorities decide on the examination of the relevant tax collectors.
After the audit, the tax examiners must report their results so that the RMS can learn from the results of the tests it has proposed.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rule-based fuzzy system.
Based on many data from processed VAT returns and some other clues, this neuro-fuzzy system (also known as the data-mining system) calculates how likely it is that a tax collector is to be involved in tax fraud.
It then draws up a monthly list of suspected tax cheats.
On the basis of this list, the Fähr select the relevant tax collectors for examination and report the audit results to the data centre in question.
The introduction of these three RMS is under way in the federal states.
Since each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three systems for the fight against fraud appears to be effective.
It remains to be seen whether the desired effects will be achieved in actual use.
Comparison and evaluation
Although in this report it is not possible to deal with the specific criteria of the RMS in the Czech Republic and Germany, the NK and BRH have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.
Like the different approaches in the three German federal states mentioned above, the RMS of each European state has its particular strengths and weaknesses.
An exchange of experience on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud is currently taking place between the tax authorities of the European Member States.
VAT fraud - in particular carousel fraud - has turned out not to be a national problem, but a European one.
The people involved in the fraud coordinate their actions not only in one but in several Member States.
One Member State alone cannot develop an effective RMS.
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EC Member State. If this does not happen, fraudsters choose the Member State with the weakest RMS for their crimes.
The tax losses caused by Europe-wide VAT fraud do not necessarily affect the Member State in which the initiator resides.
Any other Member State involved in the fraud can be affected.
This is why there should be a European exchange of experience on the RMS.
Selected results from the audit of individual sales In the context of the parallel tests, the NK and BRH examined the quality and usefulness of information on selected deliveries and / or
The international exchange of information between the financial administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.
In addition, the two tax authorities jointly examined the execution of several deliveries, about which there were doubts, or which the tax authorities of both states explained differently in the tax returns or ZM.
At the request of the BRH, the NCA examined a total of eight transactions between eight Czech and eight German tax collectors.
In addition, in 43 cases, on the basis of notices from the BRH, the NCA examined the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany, which Czech tax collectors had indicated in their tax returns and ZM.
At the request of the NCO, the BRH reviewed a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech tax collectors.
The relevant information was exchanged exclusively on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 on the CLO.
The examination of the selected cases showed, among other things, that the different registration procedures in the EC Member States lead to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:
1.
According to MIAS data, a Czech tax collector purchased €60,500 worth of goods from a German tax collector in the third quarter of 2004.
When the Czech tax collector declared a purchase of only €29,869, the Czech tax administration sent a request for information to Germany in order to check the value of the delivered goods.
The German side indicated in its reply to the Czech request for information that the German tax collector in question had delivered goods worth €27,381 to its Czech business partner in the second quarter of 2004, €31,997 in the third quarter and €10,276 in the fourth quarter.
Furthermore, the answer showed that the VAT ID number of the German tax collector was not valid until 28 September 2004. However, the German CLO had accepted a further application from the German tax authority and had brought forward the validity of the VAT ID number retroactively to 1 May 2004.
The German tax officer corrected the ZM.
Based on this information, it was a (intra-Community) purchase of goods by the Czech tax collector.
By way of a request to the competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the NCA found that in 2004 the Czech tax collector had made supplementary VAT returns for the individual (under-age) tax periods in which he declared a higher value of purchases from other Member States and at the same time sought the deduction of VAT from purchases from other Member States.
On the basis of these additional VAT declarations, the responsible clerk of the Czech tax office could not clearly determine whether the value of the deliveries of the above-mentioned German supplier was included in the declared purchases.
In response to a request for information from the NCA, the BRH found that the German supplier had been registered as subject to turnover tax in September 2003.
At the time of registration, however, he had not ever applied for the allocation of a VAT ID number, but only for a tax number that finally applied to Germany.
Although it is usually not possible in Germany to retroactively assign a VAT ID number to a person subject to tax, in 2006 the responsible clerk of the German financial administration did so retroactively to 1 May 2004.
The German CLO allocates a VAT ID number retroactively if the German operator has not caused the delayed allocation; for example, if the CLO caused the delay following the request of the tax authority for the issuance of a VAT ID No.
In this case, the CLO will issue the VAT ID number retroactively, because the entrepreneur does not require a valid VAT ID number for an intra-Community delivery in accordance with § 6 UStG.
Conversely, a German purchaser does not need the (valid) VAT ID number of its supplier to explain the intra-Community acquisition.
Due to these procedural differences between the Member States, the German CLO issued the VAT ID number in this particular case retroactively.
2.
As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech finance official asked for the verification of the German entrepreneur's VAT registration.
According to the MIAS data, the date of registration is March 5, 2005, while a registration certificate issued by the local German FA indicates October 1, 2004.
The German authorities announced in their reply that the German tax practitioner was registered on 1 October 2004, but for organisational reasons was not allocated a VAT ID number in Germany until 16 February 2005.
In response to a request from the local Czech Treasury official, the NCO learned that the tax officer had carried out a VAT audit for the tax periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.
On this examination, the tax office found that the Czech tax collector had declared in his VAT return services worth CZK 9,897, which he had provided to the German tax collectors before their VAT registration (i.e. before 1 October 2004).
The (Czech) tax office set a tax debt of CZK 1,880 for the third quarter of 2004 against the Czech tax payer.
In response to the question from the NK, the BRH found that the German tax collector had only been allocated the VAT ID number when he registered his company, which was founded in 2004, with the FA on 16 February 2005.
In addition, the FA registered him retroactively from 1 October 200415 for VAT purposes in order to be able to monitor the submission of the VAT declaration for 2004.
In this VAT declaration, the tax collector gave intra-Community purchases from the Czech Republic in the value of 160 €(about 5.000 CZK).
3. In his sales tax declaration for September 2004 and in his ZM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax collector gave goods worth CZK 114,615 to a German tax collector.
When checking the registration of the German tax collector in the MIAS system, the Czech finance official found that this registration was not valid until 11 November 2004 and thus after the goods had been shipped to Germany.
The Czech tax collector made a supplementary VAT declaration in which he declared sales from domestic deliveries worth CZK 114,615 and VAT of CZK 21,777, which he paid.
Through a request to the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NCCC found that the Czech tax collector subsequently submitted an application to reopen the tax procedure in the case of the supplementary VAT declaration. As evidence, he submitted a confirmation to the German tax administration that the German tax collector had been registered since 1 January 2000.
Accordingly, the Czech finance official checked the validity of the registration of the German tax person in the context of international exchange of information.
According to the German information, the German tax collector was not allocated a VAT ID number until 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of the delivery of the goods.
As a result, the Czech finance official rejected the request to reopen the tax procedure.
The BRH found that in this case there had been no intra-Community purchase of goods, because the German tax collector had only received a VAT ID number on 11 November 2004.
The German recipient, however, declared both the acquisition as an intra-Community purchase and the value-added tax and also demanded the refund of pre-taxes at the same level.
Because this did not lead to a change in the amount of the tax debt of the German tax collector, the German finance official did not correct the information in the VAT declaration.
The BRH also noted that the company of the German tax collector mentioned in the request for information was changed during the processing of the answer in Germany, which led to confusion between two German tax collectors.
This change in the name of the German tax collector also confused the Czech finance official.
4.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German finance official reviewed the purchase of goods in the first quarter of 2005 by a Czech tax collector from a German tax collector worth €22,686.
Through a request from the local tax officer in the Czech Republic, the NKKA found that the Czech tax officer had examined, during an external audit of the Czech tax authority, whether the intra-Community delivery had actually taken place and whether the Czech tax collector had recorded and paid the bill for the delivery of the goods.
The Czech tax collector did not explain the intrinsically bad acquisition in his VAT declaration, because the German supplier did not indicate his VAT ID number in the invoice, but only his tax number, which is intended for business within Germany.
According to the MIAS data, the German tax collector will not be registered for VAT in connection with intra-Community transactions until 21 April 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech tax collector.
The Czech finance official also requested that the German financial administration send a copy of the registration certificate of the German tax collector, so that if necessary he could initiate a corresponding tax procedure.
The Czech FA considered this business to be the purchase of goods from a non-entrepreneurial (private) person in Germany and therefore did not impose a VAT on the purchase of the goods from Germany.
The BRH found that under German law, a tax collector who delivers goods to other Member States does not have to have a VAT ID number for intra-Community deliveries in order to be able to claim the VAT exemption for such a delivery.
The supplier must only have the purchaser's VAT number in the other Member State and must be able to prove the transport of the goods in question to the other Member State.
In this case, the turnover under German tax law is a (tax-exempt) intra-Community supply, which should be subject to employment taxation in the Czech Republic.
In any case, it is important that the Czech finance officer took note of this business incident, because the delivery of a machine of this value did not belong to the core business of the German supplier.
As described in section 4.6.2, the German CLO refuses requests for information on intra-Community transactions if they are below the minimum amount of €15,000: 5.
According to MIAS data, a Czech tax collector purchased €12,561 worth of goods from a German tax collector in the third quarter of 2004.
The Czech financial officer carried out an audit for this period of taxation.
As part of the intergovernmental assistance, the Czech financial administration requested the verification of the delivery of the goods by means of a SCAC form.
The Czech tax collector said that he had not received the goods, had never been in contact with the German company and that the purchase of the goods in question had not been booked with him.
The German financial administration rejected the request for the transfer of receipts - contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents - because the turnover was less than €15,000 and no other reasons had been given.
Since the Czech tax officer did not receive any documents for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods, the tax assessment was not successful and the original tax determination remained in place.
On the basis of a request from the NCA, the BRH found that the German tax collector acted as a "fiscal representative" (§ 22 (a) - (e) UStG).
The German tax authority explained these deliveries in its sales tax declaration and in the ZM.
His right to tax exemption has been recognised.
On the basis of the notification from the BRH, the German FA will send the documents necessary for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods to the Czech Republic.
In section 4.6.1 it was shown that the responses of the German financial administration to requests for information exceeded the three-month period more frequently than the answers of the Czech financial administration:
6. In its audit, the NK found that on 5 October 2005, the Czech financial administration had submitted a request for information on the value of the supply of goods to Germany in the fourth quarter of 2004.
In the ZM for this quarter, the German tax collector reported a delivery of goods to the Czech tax collector in the value of €86,307; however, the Czech tax collector only declared the purchase of goods in the value of €35,314 for the same period in his VAT declaration.
In response to the request for information, which was sent to the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after the expiration of the maximum period specified in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003, the German side announced that the request for information could not be processed because the German company had been dissolved at the end of 2005.
Because the German tax administration did not meet the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the documents necessary for taxation in the Czech Republic.
7. In 2005, a Czech finance official asked for verification of a third and fourth quarter 2004 delivery of cars to a German tax collector worth €1,265,554 by means of a SCAC form, with evidence of carousel fraud.
The NK found that at the time of its examination, a German response to the request for information had not yet been received.
Through a request from the local finance officer, the NKKähr found that the Czech tax collector had not explained in his VAT declaration the delivery of new motor vehicles to this German tax collector in the value of CZK 11,816,103.
The Czech finance official corrected the information in the tax return and the Czech tax inspector issued a corrected ZM.
Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not forward this request for information to the local FA for consideration.
Following the notification by the BRH, a special VAT assessment was carried out on the German purchaser in Germany, which found that the purchase of all the vehicles in question had been correctly taxed and that the vehicles were sold to other tax collectors in Germany.
8. According to MIAS data, the Czech tax collector purchased a car worth €48,500 from a German tax collector in the fourth quarter of 2004.
However, the Czech tax collector did not declare an intra-Community purchase.
In a request to the local finance officer in the Czech Republic, the NKKähr found that the Czech tax collector had not made a VAT return since August 2004.
The Czech tax collector did not make any tax returns, even when requested by the financial officer. As a result, on 23 May 2005, the FA set the value-added tax debt for the period October to December 2004 at zero.
On June 2, 2005, the CLO issued an instruction for the examination of the mentioned delivery by the German tax authority.
Since the Czech tax officer did not cooperate with the financial officer, he sent a request for information on the above-mentioned delivery to Germany.
Since the response to the request for information was received only on 7 February 2007, it was not known until the completion of the examination of the NK how the Czech Treasury official used the information obtained during the international exchange of information.
Due to non-compliance with the provisions of the Czech VAT Act, the VAT registration of the Czech tax person was deleted with effect from 23 August 2005.
In some cases, only a partial reply has been sent, because at the time of the NCA and BRH audit, the competent FA had not yet completed the external audit:
9.
In 2005, by means of a SCAC print, the Czech finance official asked for the verification of a third-quarter 2004 delivery of motor vehicles to a German tax collector worth €16,991, with evidence of carousel fraud.
In his reply to the request for information, the German finance official indicated that he had only received invoices for deliveries worth €16,335 issued by the Czech tax authority.
On the basis of the question from the NK, the BRH found that the external examination carried out by the German FA had not yet been completed by the purchaser in Germany.
The German acquirer declared the purchase of goods worth €16,335 twice in its pre-tax declarations for the months of August and September 2004.
10. In 2005, by means of a SCAC form, a Czech finance official asked for verification of the deliveries of motor vehicles to a German tax collector in the value of €198,167 in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, with evidence of carousel fraud.
The German financial administration sent a partial reply to the request for information to the Czech Republic, in which it confirmed that the German tax collector had purchased several vehicles, and that the investigation in Germany had not yet been completed.
The NCA found that the local FA had carried out several external audits of the Czech tax collector in order to check the deduction of above-average pre-tax rates.
However, an unauthorised claim has not been established.
The BRH found that the German tax collector had declared the purchase of goods from other Member States with a total value of €579,114 for the period in question in his VAT returns, and that the German FA's examination of the purchaser in Germany has not yet been completed.
Section 4.4.1 describes the reasons for discrepancies between the declaration of intra-Community purchases in the recipient's VAT declaration and the information in the supplier's ZM.
In the cases examined, it was found that periodical discrepancies or incorrect declaration of a turnover as an intra-Community delivery of goods were not the most frequent reasons for the differences:
11.
According to MIAS data, in the first quarter of 2005, the Czech tax collector purchased goods worth €35,716 from the German tax collector, but the Czech tax collector did not declare the acquisition.
Since the Czech tax officer did not cooperate with the financial officer and did not do business at the company's legal headquarters, the Czech finance official asked for an assessment of how the German tax officer had communicated with the Czech one during the international exchange of information.
The German response to the request for information showed that according to the findings of the German tax administration, the Czech tax collector was unknown at the specified address and the goods were picked up by an agreed shipping agent.
The total value of the order was €155,000, but the German tax collector only supplied goods worth €21,659.
The Czech tax collector sent the German tax collector a false payment confirmation of the amount of €155,153 in favour of the German tax collector.
After revealing the fraudulent behaviour of the Czech acquirer, the German tax collector, with the support of his other Czech clients, was able to recover the material delivered, with the exception of a part of the value of €7,916.
Through a request to the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NKKähr found that, based on the information received, the financial administration subsequently applied VAT on shipments of goods from other Member States in the amount of CZK 388,522 to the Czech tax authority.
On the basis of a request from the NK, the BRH confirmed that the German supplier had reported only one delivery of goods to the Czech tax collector, worth €7,916, after correction.
In accordance with German legislation, the German tax authority declared the withdrawal of the delivery and the reduction of the tax base in the quarter of the withdrawal.
His ZM provided the following information to the Czech tax authorities:
12.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German financial administration requested verification of the delivery of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005 by means of a SCACVordruck.
According to the request for information, the Czech tax collector had in the period in question supplied the German tax collector with a total value of €396,126 and provided services worth €11,885.
The NCA found that the Czech tax administration had carried out an audit of the Czech tax collector in order to investigate the delivery.
In response to the request for information, the Czech financial administration announced that the Czech tax collector had delivered and installed a production facility to the German company.
The Czech tax officer supplied the individual parts of the production plant before the Czech Republic's accession to the EC and the production plant was installed on the basis of the order after 1 May 2004.
The German tax collector did not remove the assembled production line and claimed defects.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech tax collector charged the German the production plant for €107,100 and €11,885 for services.
The German tax collector received the rebates, but did not recognize them and did not pay them.
In response to a request from the local finance officer in the Czech Republic, the NCCC found that all invoices had been properly recorded on the books of the Czech tax collector.
The VAT returns for the third quarter of 2005 included only the amounts documented by the Czech tax collector and related to invoices invoiced after the first of May 2004.
The BRH found that the local FA came to the conclusion, on the basis of the response of the Czech financial administration, that these transactions were a uniform (goods) delivery of the Czech tax collector to the German one, including the assembly done.
In this particular case, the place of fulfilment for this so-called factory delivery is the place where the production plant is installed.
The German recipient of the work delivery owes the sales tax according to the German VAT law.
At the same time, the recipient can claim a deduction of the same amount.
The German FA did not correct the VAT declaration, as the German tax authority's liability for turnover remained unchanged.
13. According to MIAS data, Czech tax collector A purchased a machine worth €58,000 from German tax collector C. in February 2005.
The Czech finance official sent a request for verification of this information to Germany.
In response to the request for information, the German side announced that the German tax collector C had delivered the machine in 2004 to the Czech tax collector B, who returned it to the German tax collector C in October 2004.
According to the German financial administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but to the branch of the German tax authority C in the Czech Republic.
In response to the request for information, it also emerged that the German tax collector C had delivered the machine to the Czech tax collector A in February 2005.
He received the machine at the headquarters of the German tax collector's office in the Czech Republic.
Since this delivery (from C to A) took place only within the Czech Republic, there was no common delivery of goods.
By way of a request to the local tax officer responsible for fiscal B, the NCA found that according to MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004, the German tax accountant C had delivered goods worth €88,027 to the Czech tax collector (another machine).
Tax officer B said he did not receive the goods, so the local Czech finance official sent a request for information to Germany.
The answer was that the machine had been delivered.
In the course of further investigations into the tax collector B, the tax officer found that the machine, worth €88,027, had not been registered with the tax collector B and that it could be the same type of machine as the branch of the German tax collector C had delivered to the Czech tax collector A in February 2005.
The NCA also found that the Czech tax officer in charge of tax-dodging A had carried out an audit of the latter.
The financial officer had the invoice of the German tax authority C of 7 February 2005, in which the tax person A is to be specified as the recipient of the machine.
The Czech finance official noted that tax collector A had not recorded this bill.
Tax officer A had signed a lease agreement with another Czech company, whose object was a machine of the same type.
The leasing company delivered the machine on February 9, 2005 and also provided transport.
The Czech FA did not use the information provided in the reply to the request for information to determine the tax liability of tax collector A.
The BRH found that the German tax collector C had delivered the machine, worth €88,027, not to the Czech Republic, but to another German tax collector D.
Accordingly, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods, but a tax-compliant delivery within Germany.
Consequently, the German finance official did not recognise the claim of the German tax authority C on VAT exemption and corrected the information in his tax return.
German tax collector D delivered the machine to Czech tax collector B.
According to German law, this delivery was not subject to tax in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.
The BRH also found that the German tax accountant C, in his ZM for the first quarter of 2005, had indicated the delivery of a machine worth €58,000 to the Czech tax collector A.
This delivery was not checked during the German FA's tax audit.
The figure below shows the contractual relationship between the business partners involved in the above-mentioned transactions.
14.
When examining the requests for information received, the NCA found that on October 4, 2005, the Czech tax administration had received a request for information from Germany, in which a German finance official requested the verification of intra-Community deliveries of a German tax credit worth €879,680,625 to a Czech tax collector.
The German finance official indicated that there was a suspicion that this was a preventive intra-Community delivery of goods.
The German tax collector has not been active in business since 1999.
The NCA found that the Czech Treasury official had carried out an external audit of the Czech tax collector.
The head of the Czech company said it was probably a claim of the German tax authority against the German financial administration, which the Czech tax authority had claimed as a shareholder in the German company in the German FA.
According to the information given to the NK, the Czech finance official has not yet been informed that the German financial administration is handling the case with respect to the Czech tax collectors.
From the information available, it appears that it was not a delivery of goods; nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored in the MIAS as an intra-Community delivery of goods from Germany to a Czech tax collector.
The main reason for these discrepancies was the omission of the intra-Community acquisition in the recipients' tax returns (see section 4.4.1):
15. According to MIAS data, in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005, a German tax collector supplied a Czech tax payer with a total value of €33,205.
However, the Czech tax collector did not declare the acquisition within the Community.
The Czech finance official asked for an assessment of the delivery of goods from Germany as part of the interstate exchange of information.
In response to this request for information, the German side said that the German tax collector had sent a part of the goods to the address of the Czech tax collector, and that he had personally picked up the remaining goods.
In a request to the local Czech financial officer, the NCA found that the Czech tax collector had made a supplementary VAT declaration for the period in question before receiving a reply to the request for information.
Nevertheless, the differences regarding the value of the purchases could not be clarified, so the Czech finance official recommended a tax audit of the Czech tax authority.
This test has not yet been carried out.
16. According to MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004, a German tax collector had delivered €46,854 worth of goods to a Czech tax collector.
For the same period, a Czech tax collector declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only €14,856.
As part of the interstate exchange of information, the Czech finance official asked for verification of the actual value of the delivery.
With the German answer to this request, three invoices were sent, which showed a total value of the delivered goods of 31,999 €, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech tax authority and the MIAS data.
In response to a request from the local Czech tax officer, the NK found that after receiving the answer from Germany, it had turned to the accountant of the Czech tax authority and remained with her in such a way that, after checking the invoices, she wanted to talk with the company owner about the submission of a supplementary VAT declaration for the third quarter of 2004.
Until now, no supplementary VAT declaration has been made.
The Czech treasury official told the NK that it would proceed in such a way that the deadlines for retroactively setting the turnover tax for the respective tax period would be respected.
17.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German tax collector delivered €11,600 worth of goods to the German tax collector.
As part of the interstate exchange of information, the German finance official asked for a check on whether the mentioned Czech tax collectors actually existed, since the alleged owner of the German tax collectors had created a number of false claims in Germany.
In the course of the FA's review of the operation, the Czech tax collector confirmed the purchase of the goods.
According to the Czech tax authority, the goods were not delivered from Germany to the Czech Republic, but were resold in Germany in 2005.
The Czech tax collector presented evidence of the sale in January 2005.
The Czech tax collector was not registered as subject to turnover tax in Germany and did not tax the sale of the goods in the Czech Republic or in Germany.
All these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany, and the Czech finance official provided these details in his reply to the request for information to the German financial administration.
In a request to the local Czech tax officer, the NCO stated that the Czech tax collector had made a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004, in which he declared, among other things, the value of the goods he had purchased from a German tax collector and at the same time asserted the right to deduct VAT on purchases from other Member States.
In his Czech VAT declaration, he did not declare any sales tax on the sale of goods in Germany.
On the basis of a supplementary VAT declaration, which was issued after the external audit, the Czech financial officer determined the value added tax debt unchanged.
According to Czech legislation, in this case, there was no acquisition of goods from other Member States, as the goods were not shipped or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.
Thus, the Czech Treasury official drew a false conclusion in the external audit.
The BRH found that immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information, which showed that the goods had not left Germany, the German tax officer corrected the tax return and demanded the payment of sales tax of €1,600.
In addition, the competent FA sent a control notice to the FA responsible for the actual recipient of the goods to ensure that the resale of these goods is properly taxed.
In the following cases, operators declared intra-Community deliveries that may not have been carried out:
18.
The Czech finance official received a request for information from the German financial administration on whether the Czech tax collector had purchased a car worth €47,400 from the German tax collector in February 2005.
A copy of the VAT registration certificate of the Czech tax collector was attached to the request for information.
As a further attachment, a photocopy of the passport was attached to the person who was to have transferred the vehicle.
In the course of his investigation, the Czech financial officer discovered that the passport had been stolen, that the person named in it had not introduced a vehicle to the Czech Republic and indicated that he had no contacts with a German tax collector.
The VAT registration certificate, the print of which was sent by the German side, was not issued by the Czech financial administration.
With this information, the Czech finance official responded to the request for information and said at the same time that he could not confirm the purchase of the car.
In a request to the local Czech financial officer, the NKKähr stated that the Czech tax collector does not have his registered office at the address indicated in the commercial register and that the company's managing director is not available.
After a tax appeal procedure for the tax period of February 2005, the Czech Treasury official determined the tax debt of the Czech tax collector to be zero.
In the course of a further investigation, the Czech financial officer found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had purchased it on the basis of an internet advertisement.
The BRH found that the local German finance official had refused the claim of the German tax authority to exempt this supply from the VAT on the basis of the Czech response to the request for information.
19. In the course of an external audit, a German FA was not able to clarify a difference of €3,000 between the value of the purchased goods indicated in the VAT declaration and the reported values from other Member States.
A Czech tax collector should have delivered goods worth €89,424 to a German tax collector in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.
Since the acquisition declared by the German tax authority was not in accordance with the MIAS data, the German finance official requested the verification of the deliveries and their payment within the framework of the interstate exchange of information.
In his reply to the request for information, the Czech finance official indicated that the only managing director of the Czech company had been removed from the commercial register on 8 July 2005 and that a new managing director had not yet been registered.
The German recipient of the goods was presumed to be a relative of the Czech company's shareholder.
The Czech tax collector issued a VAT return and a ZM, which, after the deletion of the managing director in the commercial register, was signed by an unauthorised person, namely this shareholder of the company.
The accountant of the Czech tax collector informed the financial officer that the owner of the capital had paid the payment in euros to the company's account for the goods invoiced.
Cash receipts have not been issued.
In a request to the local Czech FA, the NK stated that the financial officer had recognised the Czech tax authority's claim to VAT exemption for shipments of goods to other Member States, worth CZK 1,326,307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 in the first quarter of 2005.
The BRH found that the German tax officer did not correct the German purchaser's VAT declaration, since in the meantime a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German tax collector.
Since the previous external audit showed no evidence of tax fraud, there was no prospect of actually being able to collect a fixed VAT debt.
20. According to MIAS data, a German tax collector purchased goods from the Czech Republic worth €4,251,196 in 2005, after which he had purchased goods worth €43,274 the previous year.
The German tax collector did not declare the intra-Community purchases in his 2004 VAT declaration or in the 2005 one.
In addition, he did not explain the value of the initial sales.
Due to these discrepancies, the German FA submitted a request for information regarding the 4th quarter 2005 and the 1st quarter 2006.
In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-Community shipments of goods with a total value of CZK 167,246,083.
On 6 September 2006, the request for information was received, in which the German side requested to check whether the delivery reported by the Czech tax authority had actually taken place.
In response to this request for information, the Czech financial administration said that the German request could not be met because the Czech company does not have a managing director (or other legal representative).
Documents provided to the NCA by the competent financial officer show that on 30 March 2006, together with the managing director of the Czech tax authority, a protocol for the commencement of the sales tax audit for the 4th quarter 2004 and the period January to December 2005 was drawn up.
At the same time, the tax officer asked the tax officer to provide all accounting and tax documents for this period, but omitted to do so.
According to the Commercial Register, the term of office of the only managing director expired on 16 May 2005 without the appointment of a new managing director.
The Czech tax collector has not issued any tax returns since April 2006.
As part of the parallel investigation, the NCA, in cooperation with the BRH, investigated several cases of intra-Community deliveries between the Czech Republic and Germany, which were not the subject of a prior exchange of information between the two countries.
The two courts of auditors exchanged information on the cases under review via the CLO of both countries.
21. A Czech company (UCR), which is not based in Germany, informed the competent FA (Chemnitz-Süd) that it wanted to conduct tax-deductible business in Germany.
Based on this information, the company was registered in June 2005, but did not receive a German VAT ID.
The (UCR) accepted an order from a Danish company (UDK) for the production of wind turbines and their delivery to Austria in the name, at the risk and for the account of the Danish customer.
Due to insufficient manufacturing capacity, the Danish company passed on part of the order to a German tax collector (UDE) based in Germany.
The following figure shows the contractual relationship and the transport route of the wind turbines:
According to German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:
- The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines to Austria in its name, at its own risk and for its own installation bill.
Due to the assembly, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the delivery of the wind turbines is controllable in Austria.
- Because the carrier was commissioned by the Danish company (UDK) and the latter had the transport carried out in its own name, at its own risk and for its own account, the delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE) is where the transport began, i.e. in Germany.
Although the wind turbines were delivered to another EC Member State (AU) and the recipient is registered as tax-compliant in an EC Member State (CR), no tax exemption could be claimed for the delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE), since the EC Member State for which the delivery was intended is a different country from the seat of the Czech business19.
Accordingly, the delivery will be properly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) has claimed the deduction in its VAT returns.
The location of the Czech company's (UCR) delivery also depends on where the transport began.
However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.
- The delivery of wind turbines produced in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
- The delivery of the remaining wind turbines produced in Germany took place in Germany.
Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) provided both intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-Community deliveries from Germany to Austria.
The BRH found that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare intra-Community deliveries in its German tax returns or in its ZM made against the German CLO.
Thus, the Czech company may have uniformly treated all its intra-Community deliveries as intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic.
The NCP found that (UCR) did not report intra-Community deliveries to Austria, but intra-Community deliveries to Denmark.
In order to secure the taxation of intra-Community purchases in Austria, the cooperation of at least four financial administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German) would be necessary, although in this case there is no evidence of tax fraud or tax evasion.
In addition, the NCA and the BRH reviewed case studies to show the size of the differences between the information in the VAT returns and the MIAS data caused by the different laws of 2004.
The cases also show that it takes some time for tax collectors and tax collectors to apply the new legal requirements:
22. In his ZM for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004, a Czech tax person reported shipments of goods with a total value of CZK 792,977,452 to a German tax collector.
In the same period, another Czech tax collector reported in his ZM intra-Community deliveries to another German tax collector for a total value of CZK 18,157,265.
According to the information provided by the BRH to the NCBs, both cases involved the supply of electricity.
Both Czech tax collectors took into account the above-mentioned deliveries according to the Czech law no. 235 / 2004, which is in force in 2004.
In a further examination of these transactions, an audit group of the NK found that in 2004 there were different legal requirements regarding the supply or purchase of electrical energy between the Czech Republic and Germany.
Whereas in the Czech Republic the tax collectors declared the supplies of electrical energy in accordance with the provisions of the law No. 235 / 2004, valid in 2004, as intra-Community deliveries of goods, according to the German legal regulations in 2004, it was not a intra-Community purchase of goods, but taxable and taxable transactions in Germany.
The differences in the legal provisions were eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Law No. 635 / 2004, which changed some tax provisions with effect from 1 January 2005.
23. During the examination of intra-Community deliveries or purchases in cooperation with the BRH, it was further established that a Czech tax collector in his ZM for the first and fourth quarters of 2005 made intra-Community deliveries to a German tax collector in the total value of CZK 240,411,163 and another Czech tax collector in his ZM for the same period made intra-Community deliveries to another German tax collector in the value of CZ73,70,776.
The information provided by the BRH to the NCBs showed that in both cases it was a matter of supplies of electrical energy.
In accordance with the wording of Law no. 235 / 2004, which will apply from 1 January 2005, the place of performance for which the purchaser has its legal domicile, registered office or establishment for which this delivery is made is the place of performance for which the purchaser has its legal seat, registered office or establishment.
For this reason, the Czech tax authorities should not have specified the electricity supplies in their 2005 ZM.
In MIAS, the fact that both operators treated the supply of electrical energy in their ZM as intra-Community supplies resulted in a difference of CZK 503,881,939.
Closing note
Through the cooperation, the goals of the BRH and the NK have been achieved.
Both courts have gained in-depth knowledge of VAT administration systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The cooperation revealed differences in the two systems and in the legal regulations governing VAT administration.
During the parallel tests, interesting cases of intra-Community deliveries or purchases were revealed.
For some of them, further observation is worth it.
On the basis of the audit results, both audit courts drew up recommendations for the management of the turnover tax.
The follow-up of these recommendations in the form of a review should be part of the follow-up.
The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of both courts of auditors form the basis for the successful execution of future audits in the area of VAT administration.

Protests against Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, injured in a knife attack, has left hospital.
The far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report by the daily newspaper O Globo.
After his dismissal, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the South American country during the last week before the presidential elections.
The politician was attacked in the early part of September during an election campaign rally in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations in particular had called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks, too, the associations against Bolsonaro's racist and contemptuous statements were mobile.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital, Brasilia, the protests mixed with a rally by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced ex-president Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and was therefore not allowed to run.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.

Laschet urges the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has called for the rule of law in Turkey in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to his own statements.
Relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed," Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This mainly concerns waves of arrests, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He has therefore "made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalise in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this."
According to his own information, Laschet also addressed the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
As a result, Erdogan has again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan was briefly moved to a Federal Ministry of Defence building at Cologne Airport.

After the discussion, Erdogan travelled on to the opening of the Ditib mosque in Cologne.

While U.S. President Trump is not tired of emphasizing the successes in negotiating the denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington to be accommodated.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the US government at the UN General Debate of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula with its continuing sanctions.
"The latest standoff comes because the U.S. is relying on coercive measures that are lethal for building trust," Ri said in New York.
In these circumstances, disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea.
"Without any trust in the USA, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," said the North Korean chief diplomat.
That punitive measures could "bring North Korea to its knees" is "a dream dream of people who do not know us."
However, in order to build trust, his country has stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri stressed.

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register should facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can still only be removed with explicit consent, stresses Swisstransplant.
(Dpa) Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your requests will then be available from Swisstransplant if required.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be removed - as in Germany - only with explicit consent, stresses Swisstransplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases will a card be found at the crucial moment among potential donors.
In over 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the wish of the deceased.
"They then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," says Immer.
There is already a similar registration system in Great Britain.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman of the Federal Centre for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert, says.
"There is no register where people can register their wishes - pro or against organ donation," she says.

Under his proposal, everyone would initially be considered an organ donor, unless he or her family disagrees.

After the tsunami in Sulawesi, Indonesians talk about the situation on the ground
The local Radika Pinto describes in an interview with the German Network of Editors (RND) the situation on the ground on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and tsunami:
Were you there during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes happened, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I found out about the tsunami, I immediately went back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight because the airport on Palu was closed at the time.

Some are staying in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and gas stations are completely closed, people sometimes steal food and gasoline.
The civil service is completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, the inmates are in some cases running around freely and the search for them is difficult.
Many bodies are still lying around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How does the communication and information supply work on the island?
At the moment we have mobile phone reception, but before that it did not work and we only got information over the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people who they do not know if they live and where they are because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but for example on the road to work.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many people thought "Okay, not a tsunami" - and then it came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was a misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran onto the surrounding mountains.

High-quality transport networks are essential for maintaining and raising living standards in Europe.
Ensuring the rapid, safe, reliable and economic movement of people and goods is an important task for the state.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
It requires a high level of organisational, technical and financial effort.
When developing and developing a sustainable European transport infrastructure, difficult compromises must often be made with European and national policy goals, such as the preservation of the environment.
It is precisely because of the necessary environmental protection measures that the construction of the transport infrastructure is expensive.
When planning and awarding the construction of roads, administrations can save considerable financial resources through careful action and decision-making and use it for other useful purposes.
One of the tasks of state auditing authorities is to identify shortcomings that prevent an optimal level of economy, efficiency and effectiveness in spending on the construction of transport facilities.
The audit authorities should not only draw the attention of administrations to the shortcomings identified, but also make proposals for improvements for the benefit of citizens and for the benefit of Europe.
Summary
In 2005 and 2006, the two Supreme Audit Institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic, the Federal Audit Office (BRH) and Nejvyšší Kontrolní úřad (NK), carried out parallel audits of the expenditure on the construction of the Prague - Dresden motorway (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in the Federal Republic of Germany).
The two motorways are connected by a border bridge jointly financed by both states.
The cooperation with the NK enabled the BRH to carry out an in-depth analysis of the economic efficiency of the use of funds in the construction of the border bridge.
In the course of the cooperation with the BRH, the NK obtained data from German bridges and tunnels for its own cost comparisons.
In 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany concluded a contract for the construction of the border bridge.
In accordance with the progress of the planning, the completion date was finally set at the end of 2006.
However, during the award procedure, the Czech Highway and Roads Directorate (RMD) made mistakes that delayed the procedure and shortened the time available for construction.
The contract with the contractor was therefore concluded later than planned.
The contractor secured the accelerated construction of the bridge by the end of 2006.
For this, however, the RMD had to accept significant additional costs.
As part of the joint review, the prices of motorway bridges on the D 8 and A 17 were compared. The benchmark for comparing the price of the bridges was the size of the bridge surface.
A price analysis using statistical methods identified bridges with high costs per square metre.
The analysis showed that the border bridge under the major bridges with a length of more than 100 m was the most expensive.
This was also due to the increase in prices due to delays in the award.
Comparing the prices of the tunnels showed that the prices of the tunnels in the course of the D 8 are considerably higher than the prices of comparable tunnels in Germany.
In future tests of the economic efficiency of the expenditure on the transport infrastructure, both BRH and NK can rely on a data collection of bridge and tunnel prices.
Both courts recommend that bridge constructions be standardised and that steel composite and special constructions be carried out only where reinforced concrete structures are unsuitable.
The course of the exam was characterised by teamwork and an open approach.
During the parallel test, the examiners from both sides shared their expertise and skills.
Introduction
The subject of this report is the parallel testing of expenditure on the construction of the motorway from Dresden to Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).
The focus of the audit was on the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of funds.
Parallel tests were carried out by the BRH in Germany and the NK in the Czech Republic
In 2005 and 2006.
The NK tested the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the expenditure on the cross-border section of the D8 motorway in the amount of around CZK 20 billion (around €690 million).
Of this amount, €64 million will come from EU structural funds (ISPA).
The BRH had already examined the planning and construction of the A 17 motorway in the years 2003 to 2005, regardless of the parallel tests with the NK.
Of the financial volume for the construction of all three sections of A 17 of around €670 million, €277 million will be co-financed by the European Fund (ERDF).
The Prague - Dresden motorway is part of Pan-European Corridor IV Dresden - Central and South-Eastern Europe - Istanbul.
The D-8 runs from Prague via Usti nad Labem to the Czech / German border,
The A 17 from the border to Dresden.
At the time of the inspection, the cross-border sections of the motorways were under construction.
Both sections were opened to traffic on 21 December 2006.
While the motorway is thus finished on the German side up to Dresden, the D 8 remains incomplete on the Czech side, as the section 0805 over a length of 16.4 km between Rehlovice and Lovosice is still in the planning stage.
The crossing of a nature reserve in the Bohemian Central Mountains is planned here.
According to Czech forecasts from 2001, the traffic volume in 2008 in the cross-border section of the D 8 motorway will be 22.940 vehicles per day.
German forecasts estimate the volume of traffic on the A 17 at the Czech border in 2010 to be around 25,000 vehicles a day.
In 2000, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic concluded a contract to merge the German A 17 motorway and the Czech D 8 motorway at the common state border by establishing a border bridge.
Since both states are involved in the construction of this bridge, this single construction measure was an important aspect of the parallel audits of both courts.
Cooperation between BRH and NK
From mid-2005, both courts of auditors presented joint considerations on cooperation in the examination of the construction of the Prague - Dresden motorway.
Both sides had important reasons for this cooperation:
1.
Germany is partly financing the construction of the border bridge.
The planning and construction are the responsibility of the Czech Road Administration.
There was no way for the BRH to examine the project itself.
2.
The NK did not have any comparative data to assess whether the funds were used sparingly with regard to the total construction costs of the bridges and tunnels on the D 8.
3.
The NCO also had to examine the effectiveness of the expenditure, examining the essential technical parameters of the bridges and tunnels, which should ensure the same quality of use on both sides of the border.
Following preparatory negotiations, the presidents of the two courts concluded an agreement on the coordination of the checks on the Prague - Dresden motorway on 4 January 2006.
The auditors of both courts met in approximately six to eight weeks in the course of 2006.
In doing so, they dealt with current problems and tasks. They developed a uniform methodology for examining bridge and tunnel prices, exchanged test results on the construction of the border bridge and prepared joint reports.
The ongoing exchange of information was essential to the cooperation.
While the BRH focused mainly on the comparison of the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels as well as the procurement procedures, the NK mainly developed the methodology for the analysis of the bridge and tunnel prices.
In Germany and the Czech Republic, the legal basis of financial control differs and so does the way in which the two courts of auditors complete their audits.
For this reason, both authorities prepared separate national reports on their audit results.
This report takes into account the results of the two parallel tests.
The collaboration ends with the signing of a final communiqué in the first half of 2007.
Construction of the border bridge
In the Treaty of 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed to complete the border bridge in 2005 if possible.
They later moved the meeting to the end of 2006.
The RMD acted as the contractor for the construction project.
Germany is financing the construction of the bridge at 42.13%.
Initially, the RMD provided for a reinforced concrete structure for the border bridge.
However, in 1999 the RMD and its German partner agreed on the construction of a steel composite structure.
They justified the decision by reducing the number of pairs of pillars from seven to five and the associated ecological benefits for the Talaue.
In addition, a comparative calculation by the RMD had identified the steel composite construction as the more cost-effective solution.
However, this was based on a calculation error.
The calculation was based on a length of the new steel composite construction of only 397 m,
In fact, it is 5% longer.
During the award procedure, the RMD underwent serious errors,
By insufficiently preparing the award documents and inaccurately describing both criteria and sub-criteria.
These errors led to subjective and ambiguous assessments by the Valuation Commission and the Director General of the RMD.
An underperforming bidder contested the outcome of the award process.
The subsequent investigation by the Czech Cartel Office delayed the signing of the construction contract for the border bridge.
As a result, the summer construction season following the tender review was lost in 2004 and the total construction time available was reduced.
The contractor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter period of time, which resulted in a significant increase in the price.
Among the measures offered were the double assembly of the superstructures, the change in the shape of the pillars and the construction of an assembly hall.
In addition, the contractor was unable to obtain the steel grade originally provided for.
The new type of steel - whose higher cost of around €4 million was borne by the client alone - made it possible to shorten the construction period planned for corrosion protection and thus the total construction period.
In comparison to the offer price of around €18.3 million net, the total construction costs of the border bridge will increase significantly due to the acceleration measures and other additions.
The shortened construction period alone led to a price increase of around €5.9 million.
The cost is currently around €25.9 million net (as of October 2006) without a price guide.
Comparing the prices of bridges and tunnels
Both courts investigated the bridge prices on the D 8 and A 17 to identify the bridges, which are characterised by particularly high prices, and to compare the bridge prices on the German and Czech sides.
The research was based on mathematical statistical methods.
The tunnels on the D 8 were compared with similar tunnels on the German motorways A 71, A 38 and A 4, since there were no comparable tunnels on the A 17.
When preparing this part of the test, a precise definition of the price concept was important.
For the comparison of bridge prices, both courts agreed on detailed requirements, for example: To use the current price paid for the bridge without VAT.
(Rates of VAT in the Czech Republic and Germany are different and may change), not to take into account the costs of special founding measures, to use the European Central Bank's exchange rate of 30.12.2005 for the conversion of the currency (29 CZK = 1 €).
Bridges of various types (reinforced concrete, reinforced concrete, steel composite and steel) and of various sizes are available on both the D 8 and the A 17.
In order to ensure the comparability of the tested bridge structures, the bridges were grouped according to their design.
The analyses also took into account the size of the bridge within these groups.
Concrete bridges were the most common on both sides of the border (20 bridges on the D 8 and 36 bridges on the A 17).
The study focused on this type of bridge, as the size of the sample allowed the use of mathematical statistical methods and improved the reliability of the results.
The investigation showed that the price per square metre of the concrete bridges on the D 8 / A 17 depends on the size of the bridge (length, surface of the carriageway): The larger the bridge, the lower the price per square metre.
For German bridges, the correlation between price and size is stronger than for Czech bridges (see figures below).
On the A 17, two bridges were identified, on the D 8, with a significantly higher price.
These bridges were determined partly by a method for detecting significant deviations within a sample and partly by regression analysis of the correlation between bridge price and size (atypically expensive bridges can be identified based on the distance to the regression curve).
However, the atypically high price of these bridges should only serve as a guide to which bridges should be concentrated.
In order to draw definitive conclusions, the causes of the respective high price must be determined on a case-by-case basis.
This could be due, for example, to uneconomic administration, but also to the requirements to protect the environment or to other legitimate reasons.
Taking into account the larger average length of Czech concrete bridges compared to the German ones (see table 1), the negative correlation between the price of the bridge and the length of the bridge was expected to make Czech concrete bridges cheaper.
This was supported by the lower labour costs in the Czech Republic compared to Germany.
However, the analysis of the results showed that the price of the concrete bridges on the D 8 is higher than on the A 17.
During joint meetings, two reasons for this fact were identified:
1.
In Germany, construction contracts for bridges are mostly awarded separately.
This also allows medium-sized companies to participate in the award competition.
In the Czech Republic, many bridges are being built as part of larger contracts for the construction of several kilometres of motorway sections.
Orders of this size cannot be handled by medium-sized companies.
2.
In the Czech Republic, the variety of bridge constructions built is greater than in Germany.
In this context, the NCP noted that the construction method of bridges will be established long before construction begins,
Already when the application for planning approval was submitted by the RMD.
At this point in time, it selects a certain bridge construction variant from several alternatives, but economics plays a minor role in this decision.
Only a thorough analysis of the construction sectors of both countries would have made it possible to draw a definitive conclusion with regard to bridge prices in the Czech Republic and in Germany, but this would have breached the scope of this examination.
The border bridge is the most expensive steel composite bridge on the D 8 and A 17.
The prices for the tunnels on the D 8 are about twice as high as in Germany.
However, a comparison of the technical parameters between the tunnels on the D 8 and the tunnels in Germany did not show a significant difference.
The significant price differentials may be the result of the low level of competition for tunnelling in the Czech Republic.
However, the small number of tunnels did not permit any general conclusions.
Economic efficiency and effectiveness of the Dresden - Prague motorway
The independent Czech Republic was founded in 1993.
In the same year, the government approved the plan for the extension of the motorway network.
The plan was to gradually expand the D-8 from Prague to the state border with Germany.
The section 0805 through the Bohemian Central Mountains should be built in front of the section near the border, 0807.
The Czech Republic is funding the D 8 under the programme funding.
The programme number 327 220 "Construction of the motorway D 8 Prague - Ústí nad Labem - Czech-German border" defines two objectives:
1.
National objective: To improve the connection between Prague and Ústi nad Labem;
2.
As an international goal: The connection between Prague and Berlin as part of the Pan-European Corridor IV BerlinIstanbul.
The programme was to complete the construction of the section leading through the Central Bohemian Mountains in June 2008 and the construction of the section near the border in June 2007.
It should be noted that the end of the construction work is not identical to the time of commissioning.
The NK stated that the planning decision had already been made for the construction of the section leading through the Central Bohemian Mountains.
Environmental organisations have appealed against this decision.
A final verdict is pending.
In comparison to the schedule provided for in the programme documentation, a delay of several years in the completion of the section Nr.0805 was therefore not to be excluded.
In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed postponing the completion date of the construction phase Nr.0805 to 2010.
As a result, the construction of the section near the border did not achieve the national goal of improving the connection between Prague and Usti nad Labem.
The RMD carried out an economic assessment of the border section No. 0807 of the D8 and Section Nr.0805 through the Central Bohemian Mountains between 1999 and 2001.
The investment cost was around €639 million for both sections No. 0805 and No. 0807.
Table 2: Results of the economic analysis (EIRR = Internal rate of interest)
Variant opening of all planned motorways and highways, as well as both D 8sections in 2007.
Traffic in the northern part of the border section 18,000 vehicles a day in 2010.
Opening of all planned motorways and highways, as well as both D 8sections in 2007.
Traffic volumes in the northern part of the cross-border section reached 22,000 vehicles per day in 2010.
Opening of all planned motorways and highways, as well as both D 8sections in 2007.
Traffic in the northern part of the border section 25 000 cars a day in 2010.
The cost-effectiveness study from 2001 was based on the assumption that the section near the border and the section leading through the Bohemian Central Mountains were entering traffic at the same time.
At the time of the test, it was obvious that the section through the Bohemian Central Mountains would not be opened on the original date.
This reduces the aforementioned EIRR values.
At 31.12.2005, the cost of both sections was €897 million without VAT, which is 27.4% higher than the economic impact of 2001.
In addition, there is a risk that section 0805 will have a different and more complex route, which would affect the economic efficiency of the project.
The economic assessment showed that the construction of both sections of the motorway is economically justified with a daily traffic volume of at least 18 000 cars per day in 2010. The forecast for 2008 predicted 22 940 cars per day.
However, a study on diversion routes as an alternative to the missing section through the Bohemian Central Mountains assumes a traffic volume of 12,600 to 13,750 cars per day in 2007, which is below the economic efficiency limit.
Higher traffic on the routes, which are to replace the missing section by the Central Bohemian Mountains, is highly likely to lead to congestion and thus to higher external costs, which were not taken into account in the original economic performance analysis.
The above-mentioned reduction in revenue and increase in costs means that the already low EIRR for the construction of the near-border section of the D 8 will not be reached.
The construction of the near-border section of the D 8 is therefore uneconomic.
There were also cost increases in the construction of the A 17, as in the construction of the two sections of the D 8 mentioned above.
In the context of the overall economic assessment of the 1992 Federal Road Plan, the Federal Ministry of Transport assumed investment costs of around €320 million.
This gave it a benefit / cost ratio of 4.6.
In the meantime, costs have increased to around €670 million and the benefit / cost ratio has been reduced by more than half.
The BRH had tested the economic efficiency of the planning and construction of the A 17 motorway in the years 2003 to 2005, regardless of the parallel tests with the NK.
He noted that the authority in charge of the permit requested an unnecessary landscape tunnel for the third section of A 17.
In the course of the test, the BRH was able to convince the Federal Ministry and the road construction administration of the superfluity of the landscape tunnel.
This avoided €10 million in construction costs and €150,000 in annual operating costs.
When examining the first section of the A 17, the BRH found that the construction was inadequately prepared.
The following example makes this clear:
During the planning phase, the road administration refused to record the condition of the rock on the surface of the Dölzschener wall, as it was difficult to access.
It was only when the tunnel drift reached the wall that she caught up with it.
This showed that the rock was more weathered than assumed in the tender.
Elaborate measures such as anchoring, injections and rock-impact protection networks for around €3.3 million became necessary.
Not only did the road administration bear the costs for additional services, which were already required, such as securing the Dölzschener wall, but also for those that would not have been necessary if the building had been properly prepared.
This includes expenses due to disturbed construction processes (€3.2 million), additional training of the driving team (€0.5 million) and increased wages and material prices due to the extension of the construction period (€7 million).
These additional expenses of around €10.7 million are not offset by any lasting added value.
The BRH has taken these and other measures as an opportunity to ask the Federal Ministry to better exercise the specialist supervision it has for major road construction measures.
In this context, it should be urged that the road management authorities introduce quality assurance systems.
Advantages of cooperation for BRH and NK The cooperation met the expectations of both courts.
The BRH obtained knowledge on the planning, procurement and implementation of the construction of the border bridge.
Both audit bodies have developed a database of bridge and tunnel prices that will help in future audits.
The NCA found that the main structural parameters for the bridges, tunnels and carriageway of the D 8 are not different from those of the A 17.
The auditors of both audit courts involved in the cooperation have gained valuable experience, which will be useful in future audits.

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at a turbo pace
Time is extremely short and the number of planned hearings is very limited.
With a turbo-charged FBI investigation, Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure a slim majority for controversial judge nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been charged with coercion.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline of Friday for investigators to shed light on more than 30 years of alleged incidents.

The majority of Republicans seemed assured when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared, contrary to his original announcement, that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who on Thursday referred to the severe allegations as "scaremongering," initially refrained from further attacking the women and instead spoke of "happiness in misfortune."

FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You felt the fear
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief for Schalke after the first win of the season is great.
Nevertheless, time also played a role against Mainz.

After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11 had given the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco certainty Tedesco: "Overall, the first half was good, both playfully and from the pressing point of view," with increasing playing time, obviously more and more the head played a role.
Schöpf is not really a headball monster.
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours for me," said Heidel, "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."

And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three points of the season.
"We have all fallen a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who had no insignificant part in this with his header: "I am actually the worst head-ball player in man-making."
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was palpable throughout the arena, including, of course, Tedesco.
"We wanted to start at full strength in the early stages and turn it into fireworks," said Schalke's head coach.
Victory was important.

Schalke's Naldo "great sport" succeeds on the bench
Not in the starting line-up for the third time in a row: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues sat on the bench for the third time in a row, not in the starting line-up of Schalker, but on the interchange bench, the understanding of many people would have been great if the Brazilian, who is almost two metres tall, had really spoken of his soul with frustration.
But when the Schalker players gathered in the centre circle as usual after the 1-0 win over FSV Mainz 05 and head coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his professionals, the 36-year-old, whom everyone calls Naldo for the sake of simplicity, turned himself in and said: "We have to thank you, coach!"
"It was very emotional, it was a great sport," Tedesco later said of the reaction of his vice-captain, who despite his new reservists existence had no resentment.

One reason is called "load control."
It was not easy to tell him that.

In August, the mood in Austria's industry continued its downward trajectory in comparison to the Eurozone.
The purchasing managers' index (PMI) was at a 37-month low of 46.7 points.
Nevertheless, Austria has the third-best mood in Europe behind Ireland and the Netherlands, announced the Markit Institute on Monday on its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the euro zone PMI rose 1.1 points to 45.1 points, but the index remains below the 50-count mark for the 13th month in a row, indicating growth.
Only Ireland's industry cracked the threshold in August, scoring 50.9 points.
The Greeks were in the final light (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the scoreboard fell, but at a slower pace than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level since March with 44.0 points.
"The slightly attenuated drop may mean that the worst is over," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
