DFB boss Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil's return to the national team.
"This is a question that naturally depends on getting into conversation, on talking to him about why he apparently felt one or the other as laid down in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the "Bild-Zeitung."
Despite the months-long debate about Özil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of 92-time national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed up to a certain point that this would be the case, "said Grindel.
De 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also justified it on the grounds that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with national coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to build up any pressure, but he knows it from football that "when you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it is a pity that this conversation has not come about so far."

Return from the Ethnological Museum to Native People in Alaska decided
The Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation (SPK) will return nine objects from the collection of the Ethnological Museum of the State Museums of Berlin to the Chugach Alaska Corporation.
The Board of Trustees today approved a proposal by the President to this effect.
The objects are burial supplies from Native People from southwest Alaska.
They were among the objects that Johan Adrian Jacobsen, who traveled between 1882 and 1884 to the American North-West Coast and Alaska on behalf of the then Royal Museum of Ethnology (now the Ethnological Museum), brought to Berlin.
Hermann Parzinger, President of the SPK, said:
"The objects were taken from the graves of their deceased without the consent of the Native People and thus unlawfully, so they do not belong in our museums."
"We will now return you to the Chugach Alaska Corporation, with which we have been working since 2015 on the reprocessing of our collection."
In the future, the restituted objects will be presented in the Chugach Community, among others, as part of the annual Chugach Spirit Camp, which serves to exchange knowledge between the generations and the various tribes that are now part of the Chugach community.
A memorandum of understanding with the Ethnological Museum was also prepared during the current visit of John Johnson to Berlin.
The objects are burial items from Chenega Island and the now unknown place of Sanradna in Kachemak Bay.
Among them are two broken masks and a baby cot, as well as a wooden idol.
Masks were mostly burned or placed in graves after use, which is why there are no longer many masks of the Chugach.
The red color on them indicates the funeral context.
The wood idol is probably a shamanic figure who was supposed to protect people from danger and death.
In total, the Ethnological Museum owns just over 200 Chugach objects.
For several thousand years, the Chugach region in southwest Alaska has been home to people who call themselves Sugpiaq or Alutiiq and were formerly known as Pacific Eskimos.
Approximately 1,000 to 1,500 years ago, the present-day Dena'ina (formerly called Tanaina) also immigrated to the region.
Today, the Alaskan Natives, who call themselves Chugach, live around the Prince William Sound and Cook Inlet.
They live in seven communities: Chenega, Eyak, Nanwalek, Port Graham, Seward, Tatilek and Valdez.
Regular contacts with Europe have existed since the time of Tsar Peter the Great.
In November 2015, a delegation from the Chugach Alaska Corporation visited the Ethnological Museum with the aim of initiating cooperation for future projects.
Background was among other things the interest in creating a virtual collection of all Chugach objects worldwide.
Subsequently, the Corporation asked the Ethnological Museum for assistance in repatriating any funeral contributions from the region.
The Chugach Alaska Corporation (www.chugach-ak.com) has been representing the interests of the Native People of the Chugach region of Alaska since 1972.
Among other things, it is committed to the preservation of the cultural heritage of these groups.
The US Government supported the request for restitution by means of a diplomatic note.
In accordance with its basic approach to its non-European collections and the study of provenance, the SPK carefully examined the context from which the burial items found in the Ethnological Museum originate.
In the present case, all the evidence suggests that the objects originated from a burial plot and an unauthorised archaeological excavation.
From the travel diaries of Adrian Jacobsen it is clear that the graves were opened only for the purpose of extracting their contents.
There were no official or state approvals for this, nor was there any documentation of the consent of the community of origin.
Against this background, the decision to return was taken.
Johan Adrian Jacobsen toured the North West Coast and Alaska at the end of the 19th century for the Berlin Ethnological Museum.
The director of the museum, Adolf Bastian, had commissioned him, for the purpose of building up a collection, to collect as many "original" objects as possible that were not influenced by European culture.
Jacobsen brought about 3000 objects from the northwest coast and about 4000 objects from Alaska to Berlin.

Treysa has to fight with vandalism and rubbish
The entrance to the 36-kilometre-long railway cycle path in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and garbage.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are hardly emerging.
Shards, cigarette butts, garbage and rubbish, demolished rubbish bins and meanwhile dismantled signs - this is how the entrance with seating group to the cycle path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the showpiece Bahnradweg in the Rotkäppchenland a more than inglorious sight.
The topic has occupied members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for some time, so the cycling commissioner of the city Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been raised in the Cycling Advisory Board.
There has been no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from moving the seating group to regularly emptying the waste containers and cleaning the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also brought the topic to the local advisory board.
It is not only the garbage that drives cyclists and local residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting place to celebrate at weekends.
Not only is it often loud, but the railings are also destroyed: posts torn out of the ground, rubbish bins demolished, signs bent over, seating furniture smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the proverbial drop in the ocean.
They are annoyed that the rest area on the cycle path in Treysa is a meeting place for drinking.
"Along the entire cycle path, the focus is clearly on the Haaße hill," confirms the cycling commissioner, who is now also concerned about the new cycle path in Ziegenhain, which will be opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it becomes really expensive."
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "This may set the threshold much higher for grabbing common property.
However, this would require a police patrol to pass by in a timely manner.
In principle, Wüstenhagen would like to see the Haaße hill develop.
It must be made more attractive.
One could be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle path so far.
The tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our cycle path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany, "said the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in Ascheröder Straße in Treysa to be an extremely critical danger zone.
There is no turning lane on the Haaße hill.

Music Contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call for the music contest was a success, creative and in cooperation.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "music contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians."
A contest "with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family," as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family togetherness over coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations took part, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-time resident of Hiltrup, the Nine of the "Hiltruper Star Colors," three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Lummerland kindergarten and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, explained District Mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We have not yet experienced this in other parts of the city.
What did the copywriters see themselves connected to?
The Hiltruper See and the Marktallee were particularly frequently mentioned in the villages.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue "Kö von Hiltrup" in his hit-like song.
The Kulturbahnhof was also honoured.
Again and again it was about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about their work.
So one learned from Humberg that he had actually studied chemistry, but now also teaches guitar.
Franke was able to report from sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the programme.
And Alvin Jasic has meanwhile placed all kinds of things on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke had said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
For the favourites of the jury, however, there was something special - so that others can also hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record an entire CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Him with his Hiltrup hit, which particularly impressed Franke with its musicality, and the "Lummerland pack": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two teachers on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children performed again for the final - and even sounded "really good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the Stadtteiloffensive.
The district offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its tenth anniversary.

The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each side there is a screen, in it four cards with keywords, which - the old trick with the red foil - can only be deciphered once you have inserted them.
This ensures that the other side cannot read anything by mistake.
On the cards, for example, you can read from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
2. Windows.
3. Dice.
4. Feast. "
These are the terms that must be encrypted from now on.
Because it is not the terms that are to be guessed here, but codes.
Alternately one player per team is the encryption.
He gets a code card that perhaps says "3.4.2."
In "Decrypto," it is not the terms behind the secret foil that are to be guessed, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: He should - in this order and in this example - describe the terms "cube," "feast" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team as far as possible does not; because that wins the game if he succeeds twice in cracking the code.
So the encryptor notes down and reads aloud: "Throw" for the dice, "lots" as a contrast to party; here, of course, something like "party" would also be possible and "Prague" because he paid attention at school and knows the window collapse there.
So it goes on round by round, team by team.
You don't know the terms of the other side - but you can rhyme them better with every hint the encryption gives there.
So the paraphrases should be as mysterious as possible, but not too crazy, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rule book.
The other players probably have to study it quite long and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanatory video at decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But once you get started, you will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as its predecessor and genre primus "Codenames," which also imposes an agent theme on a game with fewer words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And if you are only interested in guessing and not in winning points, you can easily invent a version for two.

Works Pressig was home to the thrust locomotives
The railway depot in Pressig was the hub in the Franconian Forest for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers hit buffers, you could hear it all over Pressig," remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn't upset anyone.
The brakes squeaked and the wagons rattled.
That was pure railway.
Statements that symbolize Dinkel's homeland Pressig.
Nowhere in the Franconian Forest was a place so shaped by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain route to the north, which has its apex in Steinbach am Wald after an ascent of about 220 metres in altitude.
In order to cope with this, train and thrust locomotives were needed in the past, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian state parliament approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprenticeship workshop, overhead line and railway maintenance.
"The centrepiece was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 metres after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and professional railway worker for 47 years.
The railway depot (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the secondary lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On 15 July 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam locomotives and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig at that time.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for train and thrust locomotives.

There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachtener singers.

"It is simply fun to sing under his direction," said Holstiege: "He has such an easy way, it is a masterpiece that he performs." Incidentally, this time not only men presented themselves as singers.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
Heide Keller became a star on the "Dream Ship."
Now she talks openly about the fact that the series could have been partly to blame for her marriage to Hans von Borsody.
Her role as chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "Dream Ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she disembarked forever.
The series that made her a star could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That might have been a reason, too.
Because I grew up with this work, travelled around the world alone with a suitcase and many colleagues I admired perceived me on an equal footing, "says Keller in an interview with" Bild am Sonntag. "
At first she was only "the wife of Hans von Borsody," but that changed with the "dream ship."
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"Whether he liked that so much, I don't know."
She thinks it is possible that her husband at the time might have been jealous, but "like many men, Hans shied away from talking about problems and feelings."
Keller had always tried to be "the only right person for Hans von Borsody and he did not want to get to know my fears, my weaknesses.
In good German, this means: I have disguised myself, "she continues.
She always had the feeling that "she was not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman who, in truth, I never was, even if I sometimes appeared cheeky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever. "
After an already failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time."
The day before the civil wedding, I sat howling in the cloakroom and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to von Borsody also failed.
Why did it never work out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had imagined love back then "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I approached love far too naively. "

Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Senden after last-minute bankruptcy "destroyed on the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball association ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat." His protégés were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29: 30 (12: 14) - bankruptcy - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
As in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, they had not played badly over long periods, the Sendener.
Only the initial phase "we totally slept through," the ASV coach was annoyed.
The landlords quickly led with 8: 1, even the early break that Bieletzki had taken did not bear fruit at first.
"But then suddenly a jolt went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter of an hour.

"Now a damn victory has to come," said Bieletzki, who was completely served.
ASV-Tore: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).

Football: Bezirksliga: Researcher appearance of VfL Wolbeck against SC Altenrheine is encouraging
There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch took a hard line with his own.
He, the coach of the football district league VfL Wolbeck, first withdrew (internally) in order to reflect on the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
All history.
In the meantime, things are running smoothly again on Brandhoveweg.
Taufrischer Beleg is the 1: 1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine, in the past season only razor-thin past the ascent.
Yes, I am very satisfied with the performance.
"We made the spaces tight and put pressure on the ball.
That was impressive, "Fetsch praised his boys and visited each individual after the match to simply say" thank you "for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes waited in the front for balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more game shares in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs before his retirement (17.), the changed Luca Rehberg (26.) and Jan Schroer (38.) missed the lead.
This almost took revenge when the SCA hit the Wolbeck box twice in minute 41 in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer - goalkeeper Damian Hallas proved to be a master of his trade.
After the break, the VfL happily took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters narrowly failed.
Schroer also arrived too late after 58 minutes at a Thewes entry.
With the replacement of Miles Geske, Fetsch once again gave the left side a fresh cell cure.
When Altenrheines Chris Naberbäumer felled Robin Westhues in the 70th minute, there was an indirect free kick for the placeholders 18 meters in front of the guest housing.
The Gefoulte competed himself and demonstrated his dangerousness in standards.
Westhues "thing with the right slip hit the bottom left from the shooter's point of view - 1: 0 (71.).
20 minutes left, which should be damn long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck unhappily flew the leather in the penalty area in the 80th minute.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Wolbeck had to survive anxious minutes in the final phase, before Geske still had the winning goal on his head in the 87th minute from twelve meters.
Perhaps it would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

In the already prop-full marquee, the chairman of the tourist association, Wolfgang Starz, mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests. "To organise something like this for 60 years - that is an insane achievement for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that, "Starz thanked all the helpers.
Wine Princess Lisa II later toasted symbolically with the guests from the stage.
"It's great that so many have found their way to us in Abtswind again." Later, "Die Troglauer" created an atmosphere.

A festive evening for the 60th wine festival will take place on Friday, 5 October, in the guest's house, before the second round will take place one day later in the marquee.

About 150 bikers celebrate divine service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the closing service for the motorcyclists in the Friedenskirche in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Friedenskirche in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the closing service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the engine pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral concerns of the hp-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place on the last Sunday of each month at Haus Nordhelle.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Friedenskirche in Eveking.
On Sunday, around 150 bikers gathered there to celebrate a service that was anything but ordinary.
Already from 10 o'clock the cars were lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
At first, the biker's breakfast was on the program and it could be fortified with coffee and cake or even with a hearty curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was given during the biker service by Father Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical background.
"Although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill strikes rather poetic and calm tones," says Father Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.

1: 4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season bankruptcy: "Shitty situation"
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around him and encouraged them.
However, there were not many positive things to see before at the 1: 4 (0: 2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out there as a team," said 96-football professional Pirmin Schwegler and added: "This is of course disappointing, because you always plan a lot."
The still victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) met for the connection, stand with two counters at the bottom and are in their current constitution a relegation candidate.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, however, Frankfurt celebrated its first home victory of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored the goals for the DFB Cup winner in front of 46,300 spectators, who moved into the middle of the table with seven points after the successful dress rehearsal for the European League match against Lazio Rom.
Croatia's vice-world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of the Hesse at his starting eleven debut and could never be brought under control by Hanover's defense.
The striker, who was beaten for a long time after the World Cup, showed with his speed and assertiveness why he is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, borrowed from Liverpool FC, was also in the initial formation of the Frankfurt team for the first time, which began with momentum.
A header of Lucas Torró (17.) falsified on the goal net brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96-defense around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term failed Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the landlords fell almost inevitably and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a defensive corner, Haller extended his head in front of the goal, where Ndicka only had to hold his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga goal for the defender who came from the French second division AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt followed suit before the break.
This time, Haller suited his storm partner Rebic, who skillfully wavered and left 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser no chance.
In the half-time Hannover coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his team and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxons now played a little bolder forward, but there were no sparking ideas until shortly before the end, when the final goal was still possible.
The Hesse were much more efficient.
After less than an hour Rebic started a solo and then laid across De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was only show running for the Frankfurt team against overstrained guests, Jovic also hit one minute before the end.

Inauguration: New dormitory in Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new dormitory for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
The fact that "a very special house" is now being handed over to its destination in Münsterblickstraße - all those present agreed on this at the inauguration date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the dormitory of Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time now are dependent on the special architecture of the new building.
In his concept, architect Rudolf Bader took into account wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former officer building of the US Army was put to the test for the residents with mobile phone caps: "The house was getting old and no longer up to date in terms of equipment," Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators moved in to demolish the house.
According to the architect, the new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible so that the residents can feel comfortable in it.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new dormitory
Lebenshilfe invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450,000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both in time and financially.
The managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications, which let the residents experience the freedom to move even without outside help.
Gertrud Kreutmayer, head of the social administration of the district of Swabia, expressed a similar opinion: "The house is oriented towards the special needs of its residents, who need aids in order to be mobile."
The cosiness and functionality were well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The property in this location is a real stroke of luck, because it can no longer be acquired in today's situation."
In total, the new dormitory on Münsterblickstraße offers space on almost 1500 square metres for 30 people with disabilities, who are divided into three residential groups.
Lebenshilfe managing director Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed according to tariff.

Colour powder and eggs: riots in Barcelona before Catalonia's anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia.
But there are riots even before that.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on October 1, 2017, there were clashes between separatists and the police in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence activists with paint powder, among other things, to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3000 officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wanted to hold a rally to honour their colleagues who were deployed in the polling stations last year in the referendum, which was classified as illegal.
Violence also occurred at the time in an attempt to prevent citizens from voting.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central state security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
However, some of the approximately 6000 separatists then tried by force to break through the police chain and threw paint bags and eggs at the officers, among other things.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured, it was said, citing the authorities.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.

Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Collected perplexity: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate without a goal
Red and white Ahlen continues to stand still.
Also at Gütersloh FC it was only enough for a 0-0 draw.
In front of 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion, they turned out to be perplexed.
The first half was very manageable from the entertainment factor.
Those who therefore preferred to get a beer or a bratwurst could do so without any worries.
There was no danger of missing a scoring chance, because there was virtually none.
First shot after half an hour
Güterslohs Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire match in the 28th minute.
The Ahlener had the best - and in principle only real - possibility, when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty line.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, Sinan Aygün came for him.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the increasingly emerging boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel aimed from 18 meters just above the housing and after an hour also the Gütersloher appeared offensively for the first time.
After a shooting conquest by Matthäus Wieckowicz it was fixed.
Nick Flock (62.) "crowned" the quick counter over Sinan Aygün with a lax shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
They also followed up with a header from Wieckowicz (66.) after a corner ball from former Ahleners Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut reacted, first bringing Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.).
It worked - nothing.

Lubricants with a local political message: No successful advertising for skate facilities
In Lengerich, unknown persons have hardly promoted the construction of a skate facility in a conducive way.
There are corresponding lubricants in several places, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, criminal charges have been filed with the police for damage to property.
The three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" are emblazoned in large letters on signs at the Gempt-Halle and the Old Town Hall, among others.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that a corresponding lettering had already been discovered on the advertising sign at the staircase to the Gempt bistro after the professional election fair on 19 September.
Since the short message was apparently "only" left with an Edding at the time, it could have been removed without any problems.
"A few days later, however, it was back, this time sprayed on," says Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
This case is given a special touch by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skate facility is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already commitments, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department of school, sport and culture, without naming names.
However, it is quite possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to the companies that are on the smeared board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skate facilities.

Air traffic control bottleneck gets even worse
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm will come," said Matthias Maas, head of the air traffic control union, to the German Press Agency before the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight cancellations is the long-known shortage of staff in European air traffic control, for which there is no quick solution.
"Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
Across Europe, the market for fully trained pilots has been swept away.

"If you want to talk about additional work densification and overtime, this will not be possible without us," explained the head of the GdF, which has many members at the federal German air traffic control.
Maas once again blamed the EU Commission for the pilot misery.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost targets and personnel savings in national air traffic control systems are now fully reflected in the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that "do not cut off air traffic control even further."
At present, the EU requirements are being agreed by 2024 and further tightening is to be feared.
The EU is under constant lobbying pressure from airlines.
"Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," said Maas.
He hoped that the high cost of delays would lead to a rethink on the part of the airlines.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Air Traffic Control (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future pact," said Maas.
The previously announced admission of 120 pilots per year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for the age-related departures.

Public procurement of works and prevention of corruption
Joint report of the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel audits
Introduction and overview
Public procurement of services is of great importance both to the state and to the economy.
The role of the State is to use public funds in the most economical and economical way possible and to ensure fair and regulated competition.
In the European Union (EU), the procurement of services by contracting authorities is an important element in the creation of a single economic area.
In order to be able to ensure largely unrestricted competition across borders, contracting authorities will have to comply with EU rules when awarding contracts above certain value limits (thresholds).
To this end, the EU Member States have to transpose and apply EU public procurement law into national law.
This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.
Under the EU thresholds, it is up to individual countries to decide how to award public contracts.
The provision of services is also an area prone to corruption.
Due to the generally high potential for damage, the contracting authorities must therefore take appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and improper favours in the awarding of their contracts.
The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Court of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed in January 2011 to carry out parallel audits both on the EU-wide award of construction services and on the prevention of corruption.
The audits focused on the application of EU public procurement law, which is transposed into national legislation, and on the prevention of corruption in the awarding of construction, road and transport infrastructure contracts.
Procurement below the EU thresholds has also been included in the considerations with a view to preventing corruption.
The audit results of both Court of Auditors are summarised in this Joint Report.
The report should also be addressed to international institutions, such as the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).
The evaluations of the Federal Court of Auditors on the listed topics are mainly based on cross-sectional audits, which he carried out in 2011 / 2012 with the building authorities, which are responsible for the construction of roads and the construction of the federal government in Germany.
For example, he examined the construction of motorways as well as large construction projects.
In addition, the Bundesrechnungshof used results from previous investigations.
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic based its evaluations on test knowledge from 2008 to 2011. The tests covered construction activities in road construction, rail construction, water construction, construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.) as well as other construction areas in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the awarding of federal public contracts is mainly carried out by the construction authorities of the Länder.
In the Czech Republic, the State Building Administration is centrally responsible for the procurement of transport infrastructure.
In the construction sector, procurement is carried out on a decentralised basis by those bodies that make use of state budgetary resources.
In both countries, freelancers are also involved in sub-sectors of procurement procedures.
When comparing the evaluations, account must be taken of differences in procurement law and in the market structure for construction services in both countries.
Building the public procurement system in both countries
In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide procurement procedures is defined in laws and regulations.
Procurement procedures, which are limited to national areas, are governed by budgetary law and administrative rules based on it.
In addition, there are many additional individual rules for both EU-wide and national public procurement through internal administrative provisions,
such as the so-called "procurement manuals" of the federal government, in which the statutory requirements are supplemented or more precisely formulated in accordance with the case law of procurement law.
In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure is governed exclusively by the Procurement Act and the other statutory provisions, which apply both above and below the EU thresholds.
The law on public procurement was substantially amended in 2012.
The new rules increased transparency in the handling of public funds, allowed greater competition and limited the possibility of corruption in the procurement process.
Broad principles of public procurement law in both countries
In both countries, the open procedure, the non-open procedure and the negotiation procedure apply in particular to EU-wide awards.
In Germany, measures below the EU threshold are subject to national tendering methods (public tendering, limited tendering, freelance procurement), which broadly correspond to the EU-wide tendering methods mentioned above.
Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of the primacy of the open procedure (for awards to be carried out throughout the EU) and the principle of the public tender (for national awards).
In the open procedure and in the public tender process, any interested company can submit an offer.
Another essential feature of German public procurement law is the promotion of medium-sized enterprises.
The main purpose of this is to divide an overall construction project into specialist and partial units.
The individual allocation of these lots is intended to enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.
Both of the above features of German public procurement law are proven instruments for achieving economic results.
More than 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees are active in Germany.
In the Czech Republic, the EU-wide procurement procedures are also applicable for construction projects below the EU threshold.
An exception to this is the simplified procedure, where a less stringent procedure may be applied below the thresholds and under certain conditions.
Czech public procurement law, in line with EU law, contains provisions to conclude contracts where competition is guaranteed and a favourable price is achieved.
The current legal provisions in the Czech Republic allow the contracting authorities to choose between the open and the non-open procedure.
There are more than 85,000 construction companies in the Czech Republic, of which about 1,900 are companies with 20 or more employees.
Construction volume of public purchasers and shares of tendering types in both countries
In Germany, the total construction volume in 2011 amounted to EUR 307 billion.
Of this amount, EUR 45.5 billion were spent on public works (15%), which, in addition to the construction of the Federal Building, includes in particular the construction activities of the federal states and municipalities.
The construction volume of the federal government in the construction of high-rise buildings and trunk roads (excluding rail construction and waterworks) amounted to 8.5 billion euros.
The volume of orders for construction services in the construction and road construction sectors of the federal government was distributed on the types of tenders in 2011 as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public tenders, 12.7% non-open procedures and restricted tenders, and 6.6% negotiation procedures and freeholders.
Of these, 33.2% were pan-European awards.
The volume of public works projects in the Czech Republic in 2011 amounted to EUR 4.7 billion, which represented about 25% of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.
In 2009, the volume amounted to EUR 7.8 billion, representing 37% of the total construction volume.
Breakdown by type of contract for 2011: 65.1% open procedures 14.3% non-public procedures 9.5% negotiation procedures 8.4% simplified procedures for contracts below the 2.7% threshold other procedures
The data relate to all public procurement contracts for supplies, services and construction services awarded by public procurement agencies in 2011.
The above-mentioned data show that the parallel audits of both countries are aimed at a significant part of public procurement, that the prevention of corruption to be observed in all awards is of great financial importance and that the open procedure and public tendering are of paramount importance in awarding the contracts.
Summary of the results of the parallel tests
The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Court of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have carried out parallel audits in their countries on the EU-wide award of construction services and on the prevention of corruption.
In this context, the working groups of both Court of Auditors compared the relevant legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and in Germany as well as the results of their parallel audits, which they carried out in particular in the areas of construction and road construction.
The main findings were as follows:
The EU Directives on the award of construction services by public authorities have been transposed into national law in both the Czech Republic and Germany (Nr. 1 and 3.1).
In addition to the EU requirements, the anti-corruption provisions of both countries also serve to prevent corruption, with partial differences in their priorities and details (no. 3.2).
In both countries, an essential requirement of the tender documents is that they must contain all the information necessary for an appropriate bid to be made.
The performance descriptions must be neutral and must not contain any restrictions on betting or advertising.
In Germany, the procurement documents have largely complied with these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, it remains a problem to adequately determine the object of the contract.
In Germany, construction work should be divided into lots as far as possible in order to promote competition.
According to the findings of the BRH, this requirement was largely implemented in Germany.
NKÚ found in its audits, in particular in the field of road construction, that the award of large-scale services without lots or with very large lots can affect competition and lead to a restriction to only a few large companies.
Restrictions on market potential can lead to substantial cost increases and risk price or other agreements.
In accordance with the provisions of both countries, the contracting authorities may, under certain conditions, agree in principle with the companies already contracted to provide additional or modified services which prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (no. 4.1).
Most of the requirements for setting the type of tender have been complied with in both countries.
Under the rules of the Czech Republic, contracting authorities are free to choose between open and non-open procedures.
In Germany, on the other hand, the primacy of the open procedure in the case of EU-wide procurement or of the public tender, which corresponds to the open procedure in the case of national procurement, is enshrined in law and budget law.
This will allow more companies to bid.
This reduces the risk of corruption, makes it more difficult for bidders to collude on prices and produces the most economic results.
In the case of construction projects whose estimated total order values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited building authorities generally awarded construction services throughout Europe.
The correct estimation of the expected order value is an essential basis in the choice of the correct procurement method.
In Germany, cost databases are used for cost investigations in public buildings, in particular in the construction sector,
based on the evaluations of completed construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the field of road construction, but it is not yet an effective instrument (No. 4.2).
Preliminary information and announcements are to be published in the case of works to be awarded throughout Europe. This is intended to strengthen competition by allowing interested companies to prepare for the planned awards at an early stage.
As a rule, the audited building authorities complied with this requirement.
In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or lack of controls may affect competition (no. 4.3).
The selection of candidates for participation in non-public procurement procedures is particularly susceptible to manipulation.
Under EU law, the number of invited applicants must be high enough to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not discriminate and must be disclosed in advance.
In addition to the EU requirements, contracting authorities in both countries are to switch as often as possible among the companies to be challenged in the selection of candidates.
In order to counter the risk of manipulation, there are sometimes very detailed guidelines in Germany.
In some cases, the audited administrations failed to take these requirements into account.
In the Czech Republic, decisions on the selection of candidates were not always comprehensible (No. 4.4).
In both countries, in the interests of fair competition, it is necessary to ensure that the same information is given to the companies interested in submitting an offer during the tender period.
A contact between these companies with each other and with freelancers who were involved in the preparation of the service description is to be avoided as far as possible in order to avoid anti-competitive agreements.
The relevant regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.
However, the audited building authorities in Germany partially failed to comply with these requirements (No. 4.5).
In both countries, particular attention should be paid to the multi-eyes principle and the principle of transparency when opening offers.
The requirements for marking, documentation, custody and secrecy of the offers are intended to limit the scope for manipulation and are defined in particular detail in Germany.
The tests in both countries yielded only a few complaints (No. 4.6).
Examination and evaluation of the offers are defined in both countries by requirements for the organization of training and leave.
The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been consistently observed by the audited contracting authorities.
For example, awarding agencies passed on offers for review to third parties without having to look through the offers beforehand and to document conspicuous features sufficiently.
The offers were thus insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulation (no. 4.7).
At the end of the EU-wide procurement procedures, the companies involved in the competition will be informed of the intended award before it is awarded.
This possibility of legal protection also has a preventive function against corrupt behaviour.
The Czech Republic also provides for the possibility of judicial review of non-EU procurement procedures.
Only in a few cases did the contracting authorities not comply with the prescribed deadlines in the awarding of contracts or deviate from the content of the bidders' offer (no. 4.8).
Documentation of tendering procedures was not always complete or comprehensible to the audited building authorities in both countries.
In this respect, the EU-wide transparency requirement was not sufficiently implemented in the procurement notices of some procedures.
Also, some of the identified shortcomings diminished the corruption-prevention function of the documentation.
The contracting authorities of both countries largely complied with their reporting and reporting obligations (no. 4.9).
Fundamental principles of EU public procurement law and the prevention of corruption
EU public procurement law
In order to ensure unrestricted competition with the free movement of services and goods within the European Union, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted inter alia the Procurement Coordination Directive and the Remedies Directive, which had to be transposed into national law by the 8 Member States.
The general tendering principles of the European Union are, in particular, the principle of competition, the principle of equal treatment and the prohibition of discrimination, as well as the principle of transparency.
In order to achieve these objectives, the Procurement Coordination Directive lays down specific rules for construction works to be carried out across the EU.
In order to do so, the estimated volume of orders must reach or exceed the current EUR 5.000.000.
The provisions concern in particular the content of the tender documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, the observance of deadlines, inter alia, for the receipt of the bids, the documentation of the tender procedure, the requirements that may be imposed on the qualifications of the applicants, and the Directive on the right of appeal, which forms the basis for the legal protection of applicants and bidders.
In the event of possible breaches of public procurement law, interested undertakings may have the decisions of the contracting authorities reviewed in review procedures.
Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the European Union directives into national law.
Preventing corruption
The importance of preventing corruption
In both countries there is no legal definition of corruption.
In general, corruption is the abuse of a position of trust for private gain,
which, as a rule, is initiated by the beneficiaries of these decisions.
Corruption can hinder competition and cause significant economic damage.
It is estimated that the global cost of corruption is 5% of world economic output.
In the area of the European Union, the level of these costs is estimated at 1%.
In the case of public procurement, restrictive agreements or unfair practices may call into question confidence in the integrity and functioning of the administration.
Preventing corruption is therefore one of the fundamental tasks of public authorities.
They will have to review the structure and organisation of their administrations in areas that are particularly vulnerable to corruption, in order to ensure that they are adequately protected against corruption.
Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly reduce the vulnerability of decision-making processes to corrupt abuse.
The award of public works is generally considered to be a particularly sensitive area of work to corruption.
Measures to prevent corruption
In Germany, corruption - in particular bribery and bribery as well as the taking and approval of benefits - is prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
For the prevention of corruption, the Federal Government has issued a directive and recommendations on the prevention of corruption in the federal administration. Thereafter, the following principles must be observed for the procurement sector in addition to the risk analysis: primacy of public tenders and open procedures, more eyes and transparency, fundamental separation of planning, award and billing, precise and complete documentation of procurement procedures.
In addition, further anti-corruption provisions have been incorporated into the public procurement rules.
In 2011, the competent Federal Ministry for Public Procurement introduced an electronically supported control system in the area of national highways,
with the award data - such as the estimated costs and the order amounts - as well as data on the participating freelance workers are collected throughout the country and evaluated for conspicuous differences.
Corruption is also prosecuted under criminal and labour law in the Czech Republic.
The legal requirements for transparency and equal treatment of tenderers, as well as the prohibition of any discrimination, form the main basis for the prevention of corruption.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Government has set out anti-corruption measures in an anti-corruption strategy paper for the years 2011 to 2012 and updated them for the years 2013 to 2014.
Some of the measures it recommends have already been transposed into national procurement law and corresponding administrative provisions 14.
The main provisions of the new legislation are as follows: lowering the thresholds for smaller contracts, the obligation to notify the award office beforehand, including the reasons for tendering, the prohibition of limiting the number of tenderers in open procedures and thus the elimination of the possibility of selecting tenderers by lottery, the introduction of the obligation to publish the tender documents and all annexes, and the introduction of the obligation to publish the actual price and the list of subcontractors.
Examination results on the different phases of the procurement procedure
Procurement documents
Procurement documents The tender documents must contain all the information the bidders need for an appropriate bid.
In particular, the procurement documents must allow for accurate calculation.
Bidders must not be entrusted with risks that they cannot calculate.
The procurement documents consist in particular of the description of the services and the contractual conditions.
They also contain the requirements to prove the qualification (suitability) of the bidders as well as the criteria which are decisive for the selection of the most economical offer.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
The requirements of EU law on procurement documents are addressed in particular to technical specifications.
These must be equally accessible to all bidders and should restrict competition as little as possible.
The performance description must be product-neutral.
Therefore, information on products or manufacturers as part of the performance description is only permissible under strict conditions.
Avoiding anti-competitive requirements in procurement documents is also a fundamental principle of preventing corruption.
In addition, unclear or incorrect information in the tender documents must be avoided, as it opens up room for speculation in the preparation of the bids and for manipulation in their valuation.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules In both countries, EU legislation on technical specifications has been transposed into national law.
In principle, the services are to be advertised in a product-neutral manner without factory specifications.
In the service descriptions, the individual services must, as a rule, be subdivided into performance units with the respective quantities detailed.
Here the prices are to be agreed on the basis of power units (e.g. B. Euro per m ² or per piece).
Only in exceptional cases may services be defined by functional targets.
In any case, the performance descriptions must be complete and unambiguous.
They must contain precise quantities and must not include services where it is not clear whether they are needed.
Compensation according to lump sums or time spent is to be avoided if possible.
The aim of these provisions is to prevent speculation and manipulation based on undefined requirements in the procurement documents.
The descriptions of services must enable bidders to prepare their offers safely and without extensive preparatory work.
The call for tenders shall not be made public until the tender documents have been completed.
Different rules for Vonn
There is no obligation in the Czech Republic to tender for construction services in lots.
If it is possible according to the type of service to be commissioned, public procurement agencies can divide construction services into several lots.
In Germany, construction services are generally divided into lots, separated by the quantity (partial) and / or by type or subject (skilled).
The aim is to enable small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in competition, to increase the number of possible suppliers and to make it more difficult for them to collude on prices.
This type of award is generally considered to be the most economical.
Valuation criteria in the Czech Republic must be indicated in the procurement documents, both in the EU-wide and in the national procedures.
The aim is to make it completely and conclusively clear to the applicants by which criteria their offers are to be evaluated.
In Germany, the indication of evaluation criteria in EU-wide notices, but at the latest in the procurement documents, is only mandatory in the case of EU-wide procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, the evaluation criteria must only be set out in an internal administrative award note.
Procurement documents, which are prepared by commissioned freelancers, may not contain references to these offices or involved planners or surveyors in Germany with the civil engineering and some road construction administrations.
The aim is to prevent individual companies from obtaining additional information or other undue competitive advantages without the client's knowledge about the contact with these freelancers.
This is also the reason why freelancers are not allowed to send out procurement documents or to submit planning documents for inspection.
The client is the sole contact of the companies.
There is currently no regulation in the Czech Republic on this matter.
Additional or modified services that prove to be necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (supplements) almost always accrue to large construction projects.
In both countries, the legislation allows, to a certain extent, supplementary contracts to be awarded to the company already contracted, without the need for a public procurement procedure.
According to the EU regulations and the German regulations, the remuneration of the supplementary services may not exceed half of the main contract.
In addition, the additional services may not be separated from the main contract without significant disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.
In the Czech Republic, there is a narrower limit of 20% for awarding such contracts without public notice.
However, this may increase the risk of a delayed completion of the construction project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the construction work already under way.
If supplementary services are also transferred to the already contracted company, according to the regulations in Germany an arbitrary price increase for these services by the contractor is not possible in principle.
When determining the remuneration for the additional services, it is rather to be assumed that the agreed prices and the basis for calculating the price of the order that has already been awarded are the same.
In addition to supplementary services, there may also be a reduction in the scope of services.
In the Czech Republic, reduced quantities cannot be offset with additional supplementary services.
Key test results
BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Tuesday said it was ready to send more troops to Afghanistan to help combat the Taliban insurgency that has killed more than 1,000 people in the past two years.
Technical specifications and product-neutral tender
In individual cases, the performance descriptions contained references to national technical approvals or standards that had already been replaced by pan-European standards.
Some performance descriptions also included product-related specifications - for example, for graffiti protection, joint bands or noise protection panels - without this being necessary.
In some cases, performance requirements were described so precisely that only one product was eligible.
Performance directories broken down by partial performance
The BRH has not found in any of the procedures examined breaches of the requirement to tender services in principle in a list of services subdivided by partial services.
Completeness of the performance descriptions
In the vast majority of the procedures, the procurement documents were completed before the start of the tenders.
In some procedures, the tender documents had to be corrected during the tender phase, as some positions or deadlines had changed.
In some cases, the power directories contained positions where it was not clear whether they were needed.
A performance list for demolition work even consisted almost half of such demand positions.
Loose and evaluation criteria
Many awards lacked the required justification for why the services, which were predominantly advertised for the skilled unemployed, were not further divided into part-unemployed.
There were no complaints in the indication of the criteria to be used in the evaluation of the offers.
References to freelancers
A small part of the service descriptions contained references to the freelance workers involved.
Their names were partly on the cover sheets or in attached plans or reports.
In one case, the contracting authority even explicitly asked the applicants to contact the architect "on questions of the tender."
In the field of construction in particular, the contracting authorities attributed the above-mentioned complaints mainly to the omissions of the freelance workers assigned to prepare the performance descriptions.
The construction services pointed out the lack of capacity in order to be able to adequately control the performance descriptions.
KNU-TV, KNBC-TV, reported that a woman was killed in the blast, which was caused by a car bomb.
Technical specifications and product-neutral tendering In the public procurement process for the construction of a residential building with 12 residential units, a supplier and a specific product brand were specified in the performance description.
The awarding authority did not allow the use of comparable products without justifying this.
Suppliers and products were also specified in the tender for the construction of several university buildings.
Performance descriptions with power units
In the case of construction projects in some industrial areas, the contracting authority did not clearly state the scope and nature of the required services in the service descriptions.
As power units, it only indicated the converted space of the individual buildings in cubic meters.
Completeness of the performance descriptions
In the case of the construction of a motorway bypass, the performance descriptions were amended four times during the period August to September 2009,
since the scope of services had increased considerably and the technical requirements had changed.
Tendering documents for social buildings contained inaccurate location information, inadequate preliminary engineering investigations and incomplete design drawings, which meant that additional services had to be commissioned.
During the construction of a large library building, the description of the performance of the interior did not contain requirements for product quality.
As a result of these missing requirements, some subcontractors installed overpriced and unreasonably high-quality equipment.
Loose and eligibility criteria
In the Czech Republic, the division of construction activities into partial contracts or the award of partial contracts is not mandatory.
An examination of the three large sections of the construction of a motorway ring showed that if selected parts were awarded on a one-off basis, savings of up to EUR 31.6 million would have been possible at a total cost of EUR 620.3 million.
Six different buildings, which were the subject of a single contract alone, could have saved EUR 2.5 million (25%) if they had been awarded on a one-off basis.
If the construction of 20 bridges had been awarded on a one-off basis, savings of EUR 11.5 million (25%) would have been possible compared to a total allocation.
When awarding construction works in road construction, the central procurement authority set very extensive reference requirements as eligibility criteria.
In an open procedure for the construction of part of a motorway, the contracting authority required the bidders to prove, among other things, that at least three road projects worth EUR 28 million had been carried out in the last five years.
In the Czech Republic, a maximum of nine providers met these requirements.
The public procurement of another section of a motorway involved six separate construction projects, for which the contracting authority had set an annual construction volume of at least EUR 480 million over the last three years as an eligibility criterion for the companies.
Two thirds of the funds raised for road projects in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. EUR 2.5 billion out of a total of EUR 3.7 billion) were for contracts awarded by a total of five companies which carried out the contracts alone or as a working group.
In 46 tendering procedures with an order volume of EUR 528 million, only two or even one bidder made an offer.
The NKÚ showed that a narrowing of the market potential can lead to substantial cost increases.
Additional benefits
In two cases, when constructing a motorway bypass, the contracting authority did not apply any of the procedures prescribed by law when awarding additional services and did not enter into any written contracts for the additional services.
Due to unclear quantity and quality specifications, additional costs were incurred in the first case of up to EUR 63.7 million (net) and in the second case up to EUR 165.4 million (net), which increased the respective order volume by 21% and 91% respectively.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In the case of several university buildings, some services were not included in the award documents, although their necessity was already known when the award was made.
Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the national procurement law limit of 20% of the original contract value, the contracting authority conducted negotiation procedures with the contracting companies without notification of the award.
In the case of the construction of a large court building, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional construction services in negotiation procedures without tendering.
During the construction period, the contracting authority extended the scope of the works by EUR 2 million.
The unit prices for the additional works awarded without competition were significantly higher than comparable services provided by the same company.
Other findings include:
Based on a sampling of construction projects, NKÚ found that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway kilometre in the Czech Republic is up to EUR 14.6 million.
In Deuschland, on the other hand, the average cost of a four-lane motorway kilometre is up to 10.4 million euros, according to an evaluation of long-term data by the Federal Ministry of Building.
This comparison indicates that motorway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.
A summary of the findings
The basic rules on procurement documents are broadly consistent in both countries and take into account the EU requirements.
They serve both comprehensive and fair competition and the prevention of corruption.
For example, the requirement for the sufficient determination of the performance descriptions should enable the bidders to calculate and prepare their offers in an appropriate manner,
protect the client from additional services to be agreed upon afterwards and also limit the scope for speculation.
In Germany, the common basic requirements for procurement documents are supplemented by rules aimed at further reducing restrictions on competition and the possibility of manipulation.
In the Czech Republic, there are no such requirements, but the publication of the evaluation criteria in non-EU procurement procedures will increase transparency.
The requirements for the description of performance have largely been met in both countries.
In some cases, however, derogations had to be objected to, which may also have led to restrictions on competition.
The German requirement for the formation of lots encourages competition and leads to economic results.
In the Czech Republic, according to the audit findings of NKÚ, the awarding of large-scale services without lots or with very large lots may lead to restrictions on the scope of suppliers to only a few large companies.
The extensive reference requirements imposed on road construction in the Czech Republic have meant that public contracts are awarded only to a small number of suppliers and that small and medium-sized enterprises are not allowed to compete.
Also, a limited number of competitors often leads to higher prices and increases the risk of price or other collusion.
In the case of the award and remuneration of additional or modified services, the regulatory approaches in both countries differ.
Under EU and German rules, supplementary services with a value of up to half of the main contract can be awarded under certain conditions without a public procurement procedure.
In the Czech Republic, there is a narrower limit of 20%, up to which additional services can be awarded to the original contractor in the negotiation procedure without notice.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This boundary is often crossed,
as the scope of services provided by public contracts is often insufficiently defined.
If the excess exceeds 20%, the additional services must be advertised with public notice.
By dividing services into lots, restrictions on competition and resulting adverse consequences can be avoided.
Setting the type of contract and taking the EU threshold into account
By determining the method of awarding the contract, the contracting authority determines the size of the number of companies participating in the competition.
It can leave the range of possible candidates and bidders largely unrestricted, for example by choosing an open procedure, or by limiting the number of non-public procurement procedures.
For construction projects where a threshold set by the EU is reached or exceeded, pan-European tendering procedures are applicable.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
When choosing the type of contract, the contracting authority has to take account in particular of European competition and transparency requirements.
If the estimated total order value of the construction services of a project is or is above the current EU threshold of EUR 5.000,000, the construction services are generally to be awarded Europe-wide in accordance with open or non-open procedures.
In exceptional cases, negotiation procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.
In the case of construction projects that reach or exceed the EU threshold, the contracting authority may deviate to a limited extent from the principle of pan-European procurement and may award works in national procurement procedures, provided that the estimated contract value of the relevant lot is less than EUR 1,000,000 and the sum of these lots does not exceed 20% of the estimated total order value of all construction contracts.
A single construction project must not be divided into individual measures without compelling reason or deliberately estimated at too low a cost to avoid the obligation to award construction services in principle throughout Europe.
As restrictions on competition substantially increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of award method is of great importance in the prevention of corruption.
The detailed justification of the type of award chosen and the examination of the applicability of the EU procurement rules are important elements of the documentation of the award procedure.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar arrangements
Both countries have fully transposed the EU rules on procurement procedures and the threshold into national law.
Different rules for Vonn
The Czech Republic has also transferred the fundamental equivalence of open and non-open procedures contained in the EU Directive to its public works contracts, which are not subject to the EU requirements.
There is freedom of choice between the open and non-open procedures, without the decision having to be documented or substantiated. However, other procedures are only possible under certain statutory conditions.
In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure or - in the case of national tenders - the public tendering principle takes precedence. This is determined by the law on budgets and procurement as well as by the directives on the prevention of corruption.
Other types of tendering - such as the non-open procedure or the restricted tender - are only possible in exceptional cases, which are finally regulated by public procurement law.
The existence of an exceptional case must be justifiably justified and documented.
The principle of the primacy of the open procedure or of the public call for tenders is intended to ensure that competition is as open as possible, to prevent the possibility of manipulation by focusing on certain tenderers and to make it more difficult for bidders to collude on prices.
The principle of a public tender is a central element in the prevention of corruption in Germany.
The correct estimation of the expected order value is an essential basis in the choice of the correct procurement method.
The construction services in Germany can use planning and cost databases of public administrations as well as other organisations to determine the likely costs in the area of public construction.
These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects. The databases contain, among other things, cost characteristics for building categories, use units, construction elements or individual construction services.
On the basis of such cost characteristics, the estimated order value of a planned project or a construction performance to be awarded can be determined.
In Germany, the corresponding cost databases for road construction have only been used by some building authorities.
However, a nationwide introduction for all road authorities is foreseen.
Contracting agencies in the Czech Republic cannot rely on central databases or average price assessments of comparable construction projects to determine the likely costs of construction services.
Rather, in most cases, the cost assessments are based on estimates made by the financing authority or on the amount of funds made available to the construction service.
Measures to standardize cost determination procedures are still in the early stages.
As part of the anti-corruption plan for 2011-2012, the relevant ministries were mandated to create a database for standardised building materials and materials.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The purpose of this database is to collect information on material expenditure, construction and expansion works, as well as other cost-related data, in order to enable cost investigations and the regulation of unit prices.
The Czech Ministry of Transport has also published a data collection for construction projects to improve cost control,
which will serve as a benchmark for price fixing in the financing plan and is currently being updated.
Key test results BRH
Selection of the award procedure
The surveyed contracting authorities wrote out the construction work largely in an open procedure or in a public tender and thus followed the budgetary and procurement regulations.
In 2011, 59.5% of the construction services provided by the federal government in the construction sector were advertised publicly or in open procedures.
In road construction, this figure stood at 94.8%.
The choice of non-public tendering methods sometimes lacked detailed reasons as to why the tendering authorities had to deviate from the principle of an open procedure or of a public tender.
In a cross-sectional investigation, based on more than 16,000 procurement procedures, the BRH found that the types of non-public procurement, compared with the open procedures and public tenders, have significant disadvantages in terms of competition and increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.
In the construction sector, more than twice as many tenders were submitted to public tenders as in the case of restricted tenders and almost three times as many bids as in the case of freehold tenders.
The study also showed that bidding prices were on average 6% or 10% higher for limited tenders and freeholds than for public tenders.
Parallel investigations by the Federal Ministry of Building and a National Audit Office confirmed the economic differences between public and non-public procurement schemes.
The Federal Ministry of Building and Construction even found twice as high differences between public and non-public procurement procedures in the results of its studies on economic efficiency.
Taking the EU threshold into account
In the case of the construction projects for which they had identified an expected total order amount of more than EUR 5.000,000, the contracting authorities audited generally drew up procurement plans in which they defined the works to be awarded in accordance with EU and national procurement procedures.
According to the procurement plans, this meant that more than 80% of construction work was to be awarded throughout the EU.
It was not possible to avoid the obligation to award EU-wide contracts by underestimating costs.
However, partly as a result of incorrect calculations, the minimum share of EU-wide procurement procedures actually fell short.
During the construction phase, some contracting authorities improperly changed the terms of their procurement plans.
They did not justify these changes and did not demonstrate that the minimum share of EU-wide procurement procedures had been maintained.
For most of the construction projects audited, the share of EU-wide levies was generally lower than foreseen under the procurement plan, according to the results.
In some cases, contracting authorities failed to comply with the requirement to tender all €1,000,000 or more of single lots in EU-wide procedures for construction projects above the EU threshold,
and chose national procedures instead.
KNU-TV, KNBC-TV, reported that a woman was killed in the blast, which was caused by a car bomb.
Choice of procurement method
In the case of several large construction projects, such as the construction of some sections of motorway, construction projects in the context of a major sporting event and housing projects, the contracting authorities divided construction work into several sub-contracts, although these services were similar or comparable.
As a result of these divisions, the individual services were no longer above the threshold value and were subsequently awarded in simplified procedures or even in breach of legal requirements.
Calculation methods for the estimated order value
In the case of road construction, the existing price databases in this area were only an inadequate instrument for determining the expected order values.
The data were based on construction projects that had just been completed, but there were indications of a lack of efficiency, unnecessary additional performance expenditure or excessive profits for the companies commissioned.
For three sections of a motorway ring, the actual prices were about 37% lower than the estimated order values determined by the database.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Transport revised the databases in order to take into account not only the supply prices of the last few years, but also comparable market prices and indices of price increases in the construction sector.
In the construction sector, the expected order values were based on the estimated cost values of the project architects or on estimates from investors.
The actual order values differed greatly from the estimates.
The estimated price for the conversion or expansion of a large library was double the later agreed order value, but eight additions during construction led to a cost increase of EUR 2.1 million or 27%.
Similarly, the actual order value for the construction of a library depot was 33% lower than the estimated price, with cost increases during the construction phase also occurring.
In other cases, the bid prices exceeded the estimates and increased during the construction phase.
In the case of the construction of a large library, the estimated price was exceeded by EUR 16 million or 22%. In the case of the construction of a judicial building, the costs increased disproportionately at 139%, as the usable area had expanded by only 12%.
A summary of the findings
Both countries have transposed into national law the EU rules on setting the type of procurement and taking into account the EU threshold, so the respective rules are broadly in line.
However, the priority given in Germany to the open procedure or the public tender goes beyond the EU requirements and the rules in force in the Czech Republic.
Compared to non-public tendering procedures, more companies will be able to compete in public procedures or public tenders.
Public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of bids and to the most economic results.
The risk of corruption will be significantly improved by ensuring that the field of candidates is not constrained by manipulation-prone provisions of the contracting authority and by making it more difficult for bidders to collude on prices.
The investigations have confirmed the advantages of the primacy of the open procedure or the public tender in Germany.
Czech legislation allows contracting authorities to award contracts on an open or non-open basis.
According to the latest changes in procurement law, the number of bidders may no longer be limited in procedures involving previous competition.
This means that the non-open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.
In Germany, the awarding authorities have largely complied with the rules on the primacy of the open procedure or the public tender. In the Czech Republic, some services have been inadvertently divided up in order to circumvent the rules on the choice of award method.
When the EU threshold was taken into account, errors had to be identified in Germany, which meant that the minimum share of benefits tendered across the EU was below.
In the Czech Republic, there is still no satisfactory solution for correctly calculating the estimated costs of construction and construction projects.
Building authorities should, if necessary, carry out further checks to ensure that the requirements for the choice of procurement method and the scope of services to be advertised throughout the EU are complied with or that the conditions for accurate cost assessments are created.
Preliminary Information and Notice
In the case of construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe, the public contractor has to inform interested companies about the planned contracts already in the run-up to the tender.
Advance information and announcements form an important basis for pan-European competition.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
The preliminary information shall contain the essential public procurement information on the planned construction projects.
They are necessary in the case of construction projects where the estimated total order value exceeds or exceeds the EU threshold and where the client wishes to shorten the supply periods of open or non-open procedures.
In announcements, the client is obliged to give binding details of the construction contracts to be awarded throughout Europe.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Among other things, he has to make known the scope of services, the process and execution dates, the special requirements as well as the evaluation criteria and their weighting.
When describing the object of the order, the vocabulary of the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV codes), which has been standardised throughout Europe, is to be used.
Preliminary information and announcements will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the procurement profile of the contracting authority.
In order to prevent discrimination against foreign interested parties, national notices must not contain any additional information and must only be issued after the text of the notice has been sent to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union.
Incomplete or incorrect information in the Notice may affect competition and may even support manipulation.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar arrangements
Both countries have fully transposed the EU rules on prior information and notification into national law.
Different rules for Vonn
In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and notices must also be published for works not to be awarded throughout Europe.
Procurement procedures may not be started until one month after the notification of the preliminary information to the EU Official Journal (for EU-wide awards) or to the national Official Journal (for all awards).
Only in exceptional cases the publication of a preliminary information can be waived.
In Germany, no prior information is necessary in the case of non-EU procurement procedures.
In the case of national tendering procedures, notices for public tenders and competitions for participation must be published on the federal internet portal and, if necessary, in newspapers or magazines before restricted tenders.
In the case of limited tenders without competition, notices of services to be awarded from €25,000 are mandatory (ex-ante transparency).
All planned lots of construction projects are to be listed in the preliminary information.
In Germany, this is of particular importance because of the small-scale nature of the various construction contracts.
In the Czech Republic, the impact of this scheme is limited, as there is a significant reduction in the number of construction works divided into lots.
Key test results
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's top economic official said on Tuesday that the bloc's economic policy was "not fit for purpose" and that the bloc would not be able to meet its obligations under the bloc's bailout agreement.
Preliminary information
The surveyed contracting authorities published preliminary information for all tested construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe.
In some open procedures, however, they shortened the deadlines for offers, even though the 52-day period needed between the dispatches of the preliminary information and the announcements had not yet expired.
Other shortened procedures were advertised only after the 12-month period of prior information had expired and before it had been extended.
Many published preliminary information lacked references to the planned division of construction work into lots.
No announcements were made.
The notices of the audited bodies contained partly CPV codes, which deviated from the information provided in the preliminary information or which did not accurately capture the required services.
In individual cases, national notices were published earlier or contained more information - for example on implementation deadlines - than the notices in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Ex-militant transparency watchdog
The contracting authorities of an audited building administration had commissioned a service company to publish the national procurement procedures.
This published the notifications on its own fee-paying procurement platform.
However, the contracting authorities did not check whether the company had also forwarded the notifications to the free internet portal of the federal government as required.
Samples showed that only one third of the notifications of the audited administration were published on this portal.
KNU-TV, KNBC-TV, reported that a woman was killed in the blast, which was caused by a car bomb.
No announcements were made.
In the case of the construction of a sewage treatment plant, the public procurement authority did not specify in its notice the criteria on which it intended to select the bidders.
The awarding authority could not prove how the bidders were selected.
Limiting the number of bidders was permissible under the law in force at the time.
In the case of the construction of a motorway ring, the contracting authority did not specify in a non-open procedure, either in the notice or in the documentation of the award procedure, according to which it intended to assess the qualifications of the applicants and how many applicants it wanted to admit to the competition.
The awarding authority concluded in its assessment that all six candidates met the qualification requirements, but excluded the candidate with the worst ratings from the further procedure.
The awarding authority's approach was not transparent because at no time during the procedure had it disclosed information on the qualification criteria and the evaluation procedure.
Publication of the notices
The awarding authority did not release the tender for the redevelopment of the former military site.
A summary of the findings
The two-stage system of information and notification is an important part of implementing the transparency requirement for pan-European procurement, strengthening competition and thus preventing corruption.
Both countries have implemented the EU requirements and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures, including in the area of national procurement:
Selection of candidates for non-public awards
Contrary to public procurement procedures, in the case of non-public procurement procedures, not every company interested in the performance of the services to be awarded can participate in the competition.
In the case of non-public tendering procedures, the contracting authority has to make a pre-selection of the companies to be invited to submit bids.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption The EU rules allow a limitation of the number of applicants in EU-wide non-public procurement procedures.
However, in the case of non-open procedures, at least five companies are invited to submit bids.
At least three companies are to be invited to participate in the negotiation process with a tender notice.
In any case, the number of invited candidates must be sufficient to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be disclosed in advance.
The selection of companies to be challenged is a process within the award procedure which is highly susceptible to manipulation, e.g. by allowing unilateral preferential treatment for certain companies.
In addition, the restriction of competition to a small number of companies also favours possible agreements between candidates.
In both cases, the delivery result may be significantly affected at the expense of the customer.
The contracting authorities must therefore take special precautions against possible tampering, carry out adequate checks and, in particular, ensure the transparency and traceability of this process.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar arrangements
The rules for selecting candidates are similar in both countries.
In addition to the EU requirements, the awarding authorities should switch between the companies to be challenged as often as possible in the selection of candidates.
Nor must competition be restricted to companies established in certain regions.
The awarding authorities are to justify the selection of the candidates and to document the process of the selection procedure in their award notes.
Different rules for Vonn
In Germany, in the case of limited tenders, at least three and in the case of freeholder awards, several suitable candidates are to be invited to submit bids.
The new Czech rules make it inadmissible, with the exception of two special areas, to limit the number of bidders in cases of non-open procedures and negotiation procedures.
In Germany, the more-eyes-principle has to be observed when selecting companies.
If, for example, an employee has proposed a number of companies for a non-public tender procedure, the management level of the construction service or an agent from the contracting authority will generally have to amend this proposal by, for example, removing a proposed company and / or adding a new company.
The aim is to prevent a single person from being able to determine the final group of undertakings to be involved in the competition.
Otherwise, in the event of manipulative intentions, this could enable wide-ranging collusion between the parties.
The list of companies to be challenged is to be treated confidentially - also with regard to freelancers - and not to be made available to the general public.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In the Czech Republic, there are no regulations on the establishment and keeping secret of candidate lists.
According to the German regulations, freelancers are not allowed to determine the companies to be challenged, but can only submit proposals to the contracting authority.
There is a regulatory gap in Czech legislation on this subject.
Key test results
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's top economic official said on Tuesday that the bloc's economic policy was "not fit for purpose" and that the bloc would not be able to meet its obligations under the bloc's bailout agreement.
Number of applicants
The requirement to require a minimum number of companies to submit bids in the case of non-public tenders has been met, with a few exceptions.
An evaluation of the BRH of almost 7,000 non-European-wide procurement procedures for construction services in the construction sector showed that in the case of restricted federal tenders in Germany, the awarding authorities asked an average of 6.6 companies to submit bids and 4.4 companies to submit bids for freeholds.
Business change and regional restrictions
In particular, in the case of trades with few suppliers, the awarding bodies did not always change the circle of selected applicants.
In particular, they took into account companies that they already knew and which they considered to be proven.
As a reason for this, they stated that in the case of non-public procedures, the suitability of the companies to be challenged should be ensured before the invitation to tender.
The BRH did not find an unlawful restriction on regional tenderers in the non-public tendering procedures, but it found a higher proportion of regional companies than in the case of public tenders.
The awarding authorities attributed this mainly to the fact that the scope of services in the case of non-public procurement procedures was significantly lower on average and therefore, for example, longer access routes were more important than in the case of public tenders.
More-Eyes-Principle and Proposals
Contrary to the rules, the contracting authorities largely failed to have the proposed list of companies to be challenged amended by an independent person.
They justified this in particular on the basis of a lack of processing capacity, time pressure or insufficient knowledge of suitable alternative companies.
It was also often not documented who had proposed the companies invited to submit bids.
Some samples showed that the candidate lists had been drawn up by freelancers and that these proposals had been adopted unchanged by the contracting authorities.
As a result, the contracting authorities did not protect themselves against possible manipulation to the extent required.
Confidential treatment of the bidding lists
At a procurement office, the lists of companies to be challenged were recorded in a data processing system that could be viewed by all employees of that service.
In the case of manipulative intentions, the names of the envisaged or authorised companies could have been passed on unauthorised and, for example, could have facilitated collusion between these companies.
Documentation of the documentary
The documentation of the procurement procedures contained only in a few cases justifications for the selection of candidates.
KNU-TV, KNBC-TV, reported that a woman was killed in the blast, which was caused by a car bomb.
Selection of candidates
In the case of the construction of a motorway ring, the bidders were not informed about the evaluation criteria and the evaluation procedures.
In the case of the open procedures for the development and modernisation of waterways and ports, the notices did not indicate how the selection of candidates should be carried out.
In one procedure, all eight applicants met the qualification requirements, exceeding the maximum number of companies to be admitted.
The award committee then carried out a random selection procedure for the companies.
However, this approach, which was generally acceptable at the time, should have been cited as one of the criteria in the notice.
A summary of the findings
Due to the high risk of manipulation in the selection of candidates in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special measures to prevent undue restrictions on competition.
With the "more eyes" principle, the secrecy of the bidding lists and the exclusive authority of the awarding bodies to propose the companies to be challenged, the German regulations restrict such possibilities of abuse.
In the case of Czech rules, the newly introduced requirement of a largely unlimited number of bidders in cases of non-public procedures can in particular counteract possible manipulative restrictions.
However, the audit findings showed that some of these benchmarks were not sufficiently implemented and that the potential for manipulation for an abusive restriction of the field of participants in these cases was not sufficiently reduced.
Public procurement authorities should eliminate the deficits identified in full.
The offer period
The tender period begins with the announcement of the award or the invitation to tender, during which the companies can prepare bids on the basis of the tender documents sent to them.
Applicants may submit their offers until the expiry of the deadline set by the awarding authority.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
There are no separate EU rules for this stage of the procurement procedure.
The contracting authorities have to comply with the national rules aimed at countering the possibilities of manipulation that exist during the tender phase.
These are mainly organisational requirements and controls.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar arrangements
The tender documents, on the basis of which the companies are to prepare their offers, are to be dispatched only by the awarding authority.
Voluntary workers involved in the award procedure are not allowed to carry out this task.
The awarding authority is responsible for ensuring that all applicants receive the same information during the tender period.
In the event of any ambiguity in the tender documents or any other questions relating to the call for tenders, only the awarding authority may provide information to the applicants.
Freelancers entrusted with the preparation of the procurement documents are not allowed to provide any information.
Contact between the authorised freelancers and the applicants is to be prevented during the entire offer phase.
Freelancers must not be allowed to become a hub of the procurement procedure through which contacts with anti-competitive effects can be established.
Offers sent by post or direct are to be submitted in a sealed envelope.
Offers transmitted electronically have a technical encryption.
Different rules for Vonn
In Germany, the contracting authority may also commission external service companies with the printing and dispatch of procurement documents, whose employees are obliged to keep the offers secret and to conscientiously fulfil the contractual obligations.
In Germany, the offers received are to be marked with an entrance stamp and immediately, immediately and unopened, are to be sent to an official responsible for custody.
This official must not be involved in awarding the contract.
The offers received must be kept under lock and key until the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, the offers received are marked with a file sign.
The contracting authority shall record the quotation data, including order numbers, as well as the registration and receipt details, in a protocol.
The storage of offers is not regulated in the Czech Republic.
Key test results
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's top economic official said on Tuesday that the bloc's economic policy was "not fit for purpose" and that the bloc would not be able to meet its obligations under the bloc's bailout agreement.
The examinations at the tender stage focused mainly on the procurement procedures of a building management company.
Shipment of procurement documents
The procurement agencies of the audited building management sent the procurement documents themselves or had them printed and shipped by an external service company.
Freelance workers did not send out procurement documents.
Information given to applicants
For the most part, the audited building management did not comply with the requirements for the separation of planning and procurement when appointing the contact persons for inquiries and information.
In the service descriptions, contrary to the specifications, it did not name employees from the procurement office, but from the project managers, as contact persons.
Some procurement documents even contained the names of the freelancers who had prepared the service descriptions.
In some cases, not all applicants received the same information when asked during the offer period.
Marking of offers
With the tested building management all received offers were provided with entrance stamp and entry note.
In the case of some freelance awards, however, the offers were received by freelancers, which contradicted the requirements for the prevention of corruption.
Keeping the offers
Once marked, not all offers were immediately and immediately sent to the custodian, who included the offers in a steel cabinet.
In the meantime, the offers were stored in an open compartment of the post office, to which every member of staff had access.
Another department had hung a letterbox in a hallway that was not constantly monitored, in which some of the offers received there even stayed overnight.
Since the slot of this letterbox was large and unsecured, not only staff but also visitors to the office would have had the opportunity to take incoming offers and, if necessary, to manipulate them.
KNU-TV, KNBC-TV, reported that a woman was killed in the blast, which was caused by a car bomb.
On the Czech side, no shortcomings were criticised.
A summary of the findings
During the tender phase, contacts between interested companies and freelancers involved in the tender procedure will be prevented in both countries.
In addition, the principle of equal treatment should be upheld by ensuring that all bidders receive the same information.
The regulations for the receipt, storage and secrecy of the offers seem appropriate in order to counteract manipulation and corruption.
The corresponding requirements in Germany are somewhat more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
The results of the investigation in Germany have revealed violations of the rules in some areas.
These shortcomings could be remedied with little effort.
Opening up the offers
Opening up the offers
During the opening date, the previously closed offers will be opened and their contents will be read out and thus made known.
From the opening date, bidders are bound to their offers until the expiry of the award period specified by the awarding authority.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
There are no specific EU rules governing the opening up of the offers.
However, national anti-corruption rules contain extensive safeguards to protect tenders and competition at this highly sensitive stage of the tendering process.
The "more eyes" principle as well as the transparency and traceability of the opening of the offer are intended to prevent manipulations and changes in the submitted offers.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar arrangements
The opening date shall be carried out by several persons to be determined by the awarding authority.
The "more eyes" principle is intended to prevent individuals from manipulating the offers in an uncontrolled manner when opening the offers.
Bidders can participate in most of the tender procedures on the opening date.
Only offers which were available to the negotiator when the first offer was opened are admitted to the opening.
Deals received late may in principle no longer be taken into account.
In order to ensure the transparency of the opening date, the actions taken and the results of the opening of the tender shall be set out in a protocol in which, among other things, the names of the bidders and the bid prices shall be set.
The Minutes are to be read out and signed by the negotiators.
It can also be signed by the bidders present.
Different rules for Vonn
In the Czech Republic, a committee is conducting the opening of the offers.
Volunteers can also participate in this process.
The committee may also be tasked with further phases of the tender procedure, such as the evaluation of the bids.
In Germany, a negotiator and a secretary carry out the opening of the offer.
The negotiator must be an employee of the tendering body.
The head of the negotiations and the secretary should not be involved in the processing of the procurement documents, as well as in the awarding and processing of contracts in the construction sector.
In the minutes of the opening date, according to the German regulations, in addition to the quotation prices, information about discounts and discounts as well as special features - such as damaged or belated offers - are to be noted.
In the Czech Republic, in addition to the offer price, only the language of the offer and the applicant's right to sign are recorded.
The German regulations stipulate that the open offers must be marked in all parts in such a way that subsequent changes and additions are prevented.
The offers are usually marked by perforations with the date of the opening date. They are to be kept secret after the opening date and may only be made available to the persons directly responsible for processing them.
The Czech legislation does not exist.
If only one offer is received during a tender procedure in the Czech Republic, it must not be opened and must not be returned.
There is no such regulation in Germany. If there is only one offer, it must be opened up and then evaluated.
Key test results
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's top economic official said on Tuesday that the bloc's economic policy was "not fit for purpose" and that the bloc would not be able to meet its obligations under the bloc's bailout agreement.
More-Eyes Principle
The certified awarding bodies implemented the requirements of the MultiEyes principle at the opening dates.
They each conducted the opening dates with negotiators and writers, who were not charged with any other award procedures.
However, in the case of freelance contracts of a smaller scope, there have been occasional cases in which freelancers have opened offers sent to them without the participation of the contracting authority.
Minutes of the meeting.
The opening of the offers was not always fully documented in the minutes of the opening dates.
In some cases, e.g. the late submitted offers were not registered, in some cases even signatures were missing.
Marking of offers
The awarding bodies examined in the context of the cross-sectional examination marked the offers according to the specifications by perforating with the date of the opening date.
Extensive tests carried out on some beneficiaries of the aid had found insufficient labelling.
However, these awarding bodies changed their labelling practices after the complaint by the BRH.
KNU-TV, KNBC-TV, reported that a woman was killed in the blast, which was caused by a car bomb.
The offer period
In the case of the award of road maintenance measures, an offer was received by the awarding authority only one month after the end of the tender period. Nevertheless, the awarding authority accepted this offer.
A summary of the findings
The rules of both countries for the opening of the offers are in agreement in important parts. They take into account both the principle of multi-eyes and the principle of transparency. Thus, the risks of corruption and manipulation of the opening of the offers can be significantly limited.
The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
In particular, the requirements for the exact documentation of the procedure as well as for the marking, the safe storage and the secrecy of the offers significantly restrict possibilities for manipulation such as subsequent changes to the offers.
In addition, the agents responsible for the opening of the offers may not carry out any other tasks in connection with the performance to be awarded.
Overall, only a few complaints attest to the high acceptance of the supply opening requirements.
Examination and evaluation of the offers
Examination and evaluation of the offers The client has to check and evaluate the offers available at the opening date.
It is for him to determine the offer for the award of the award, which is best suited to the requirements of the award criteria.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
The EU guidelines provide for a multi-stage procedure:
Firstly, the suitability of the bidders must be established.
Bidders must be economically and financially capable and possess the necessary professional and technical expertise.
Companies which have been convicted of bribery or fraud offences, for example, are excluded from taking part in the award procedure.
The bids of the non-excluded tenderers are to be examined computationally, technically and economically and to be evaluated on the basis of the previously announced award criteria.
The client has to determine the most economically advantageous offer. Offers with unusually low prices have to be examined particularly by the client.
The examination and evaluation of the tenders is a particularly susceptible phase of the tendering procedure.
For example, bidders may be unfairly excluded or offers that do not meet the requirements may be left in competition.
By favoring or discriminating against bidders, the result of the valuation can be inadvertently impaired and thus the establishment of the most economically advantageous offer can be prevented.
The awarding authority must therefore take special precautions to ensure that the persons entrusted with the examination and assessment meet the requirements of integrity and expertise.
It must also ensure that the procedure and the decisions taken are transparent and comprehensible.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar arrangements
In line with EU requirements, bids in both countries are to be examined and evaluated in multi-stage procedures.
The requirements for the suitability of the companies to be presented, as well as the award criteria to be taken into account in the evaluation and their weighting, are laid down in the notices or in the tender documents and can no longer be changed during the procedure.
After verifying the bidding, the eligibility criteria may no longer be used in the evaluation of the offers.
The evaluation has to be limited to the award criteria.
The submitted offers must first be formally examined as soon as possible to determine whether they are complete and whether there are any notices contained in them, e.g. B, which could indicate possible intent to manipulate.
If bidders are excluded from the further examination and evaluation of their offers, they shall be informed of this without delay.
If the valuation of the offers gives an unreasonably low price, the bidder must be given the opportunity to comment before a possible exclusion of his offer.
Decisions taken during the examination and evaluation of the offers must be documented in a comprehensible manner.
Different rules for Vonn
In Germany, the offers to be kept secret may only be made available to the persons directly entrusted with processing.
The review of the offers as well as the computational examination of the offers may only be carried out by the awarding authority.
It shall only employ staff who are not involved in the procurement decision or in the implementation of the measure.
The performance of the further examination and evaluation tasks is not specified.
If freelancers are commissioned with the examination and evaluation, they have to treat the offers confidentially.
They may only make proposals for the decisions to be taken by the awarding bodies.
In the Czech Republic, tendering committees are to be formed for the examination and evaluation of tenders.
The committees draw up scorecards with proposals for tenders.
Ultimately, as in Germany, only the contracting authorities have to decide on the awarding of contracts.
If evidence or declarations requested for the submission of bids in Germany are submitted only incompletely, the awarding authority shall give the bidders the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.
Only if the documents are still not available after the expiry of the deadline, the offer is excluded from the evaluation.
In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the awarding authority whether to give the bidders the opportunity to complete the missing evidence or statements.
If a bidder fails to do so, he must be excluded.
In Germany, not only the total price but also the unit prices (prices for partial services) of the offers have to be examined.
If, due to the price structure of the offer, there are indications that prices for partial services are too low or too high, the bidder is invited to remove these ambiguities.
If it does not succeed in doing so and the contracting authority can provide proof of a mixed calculation of the prices, this offer must be excluded.
The aim is to prevent bidders from speculating on material changes in the volume of partial services when calculating their offer, which could result in significant increases in the cost of construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, the overall price is assessed, but not the adequacy of the prices for partial services.
A mixed calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.
Offers with unreasonably high or low prices may not be awarded in Germany.
If one or more offers fall short of the correct price determination of the principal or the quotation sums of the other bidders by 10% or more, the bidders shall have to prove the correct calculation of their offers.
If they are unable to do so, the contracting authority may exclude the relevant offers.
In the Czech Republic, the call for tenders may be cancelled after an economic viability assessment if only offers with unjustifiable low prices are available.
Contrary to German procurement law, the surcharge cannot be refused for this reason in the case of offers with prices that are substantially higher than the client's calculation.
If there is a suspicion of anti-competitive behaviour in Germany, the contracting authority must report immediately to its professional level of supervision.
The Commission has to decide what measures to take and whether to inform the antitrust authority or the public prosecutor's office.
For example, in the case of construction services over 50,000 euros, the professional supervisory level must also agree if the contract is to be awarded independently, if the contract is not to be awarded to the offer with the lowest price or if the tender is to be cancelled.
There are no such rules in the Czech Republic.
Key test results
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's top economic official said on Tuesday that the bloc's economic policy was "not fit for purpose" and that the bloc would not be able to meet its obligations under the bloc's bailout agreement.
suitability and evaluation criteria
The vast majority of the tendering procedures examined were in line with the listed requirements.
In the case of some companies proposed by freelancers, the contracting authorities did not check the suitability of the companies themselves.
A recipient of the grant commissioned companies without the required proof of eligibility being complete.
In some cases it was not possible to ascertain whether the awarding authority had taken into account all the award criteria disclosed in its selection decision or whether it had based its award decision solely on the "price" criterion.
Selection of participants and confidentiality of offers
Some awarding bodies used persons who were not authorised to do so when examining the offers.
Thus, freelancers or employees of the department involved in the planning or implementation of a construction project carried out tasks which were to be carried out only by employees of the contracting authority.
The construction services justified this on the grounds of insufficient personnel capacity in the respective areas.
In some cases, the freelancers entrusted with the examination of the offers also involved employees who were not obliged to keep the offers secret and to conscientiously fulfil the contractual obligations.
For the construction services, it was usually also not comprehensible whether the offers for the freelancers were accessible only to the persons directly responsible for the processing.
Inspection and computational examination of the offers
Some contracting agencies passed on the open offers to freelancers for further examination, without having previously carried out the prescribed inspection of the offers and the computational examination itself and documented their results.
In the case of manipulative intentions, third parties could have made changes to the offers without the awarding agencies being able to understand this.
In the documents examined, conspicuous features or missing price or product information were partially or only inadequately marked.
Economic performance audits
In a sample in a building administration, three quarters of the tendering procedures examined differed more than 10% from the previously identified estimated costs.
One in 20 tendering procedures has been cancelled because of unreasonable bid prices.
Not all tender audits and discussions with the bidders were comprehensible or sufficiently documented.
Many details were missing, such as the unit prices of the most important positions.
Often the discrepancies were justified only on a blanket basis, e.g. by references to changed market prices or increased material costs.
The building services explained that it is difficult to detect and verify mixed calculations.
In the case of a tender by a public law institution, the offer price of the cheapest offer was 66% below the previously determined value of these services.
Further calculations or investigations into the causes of this deviation were not documented.
In a reconnaissance interview, the contracting authority did not find any evidence of price dumping by the company then commissioned.
As a result, it remained unclear whether the estimated value was excessive or whether the offer price was too low.
Later, the client rated the commissioned company as a "low-cost company" that could neither maintain quality nor meet deadlines.
In another call for tenders, a construction service awarded the contract for an offer, the price of which was 35% higher than the value of the cost determination.
It did not lift the invitation to tender, citing the non-factual justification that a reasonable calculation could be made for this company.
suspicions of irregularities
In the case of an audited building management, there were two cases of irregularities, both of which were reported to the professional supervisory level.
In one of the cases, the calculation of two bidders was identical, so that the awarding authority excluded both bids from the procedure.
In the application of the other regulations, the audits did not raise any significant objections.
KNU-TV, KNBC-TV, reported that a woman was killed in the blast, which was caused by a car bomb.
aptitude test
In many of the construction projects examined, including university construction, road construction and the extension of the railway network, the contracting authorities did not exclude bidders from the procedure, even though they did not meet the requirements specified in the tender documents or could not prove their suitability to the required extent. On the other hand, in one case, a contracting authority could neither prove nor explain why it had excluded a bidder who had fulfilled the requirements.
The ratings are down.
When awarding construction services for a water treatment plant, the contracting authority did not take account of the predefined evaluation criteria when examining and evaluating the offers.
In the case of a construction project for the extension of the railway network, the awarding authority did not determine the weighting of the evaluation criteria until the beginning of the evaluation.
In the case of road maintenance measures, the predetermined criterion of "shortening the construction phase" was misinterpreted in a procedure.
As a result, the shortening offered was insufficiently taken into account by the second and third-placed bidders.
Documentation of the selection of offers
In three tendering procedures in the context of housing development, the tendering authority did not document which criteria it applied and on which basis it had selected the successful tenderer.
In the case of the construction of a motorway, the contracting authority selected the companies for smaller orders of up to 20,000 euros solely on the basis of telephone surveys on prices and delivery conditions.
Tests of this selection were not possible because the interviews were not documented.
A summary of the findings
The rules for examining and evaluating offers in both countries are in line with EU requirements.
However, the rules differ on the details of the procedure and the selection of the persons involved.
In Germany, the process is more regulated than in the Czech Republic by means of detailed requirements, in particular regarding the implementation of the "more eyes" principle and the protection of offers.
The same applies to the requirements on the basis of which the adequacy of the prices offered must be assessed.
In both countries, some of the tendering procedures examined showed that significant procedural steps in the examination and evaluation of the tenders were not or were insufficiently documented.
Without traceability and transparency of the examination and evaluation decisions, however, possible manipulative interventions are favoured.
A particularly serious defect was the handing over of all offers to third parties, without the public contracting authority having previously sufficiently reviewed and documented the offers and thus protected them from possible manipulation in the further procedure.
If the contracting authority has the task of verifying and evaluating the offers carried out by third parties, sufficient precautions and an increased control effort are required in order to counter the increased risk of manipulation.
In assessing the adequacy of the prices, the audited services in Germany have not always made full use of the instruments provided and have not sufficiently examined the price structure of the offers.
In the Czech Republic, objections arose mainly in relation to the aptitude test and the application of the evaluation criteria.
Conclusion of the award procedure
After verifying and evaluating the value of the offers, the tender procedure will be concluded by awarding the bid or by suspending the procedure.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
In the case of EU-wide tendering procedures, all tenderers must be informed in advance of the proposed tendering decision.
Companies have the option of verifying the intended award within 10 days of receiving information electronically or by fax or other means of communication within 15 days and, if necessary, to initiate a review procedure.
A contract may not be concluded before the end of this information period.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
If a bidder files a request for a review within the information period, the conclusion of the contract is only possible after the final decision in the review procedure.
The companies may also have the award decision reviewed by an independent court in the context of this review procedure.
The review procedure is intended to ensure the legal protection of the companies and to encourage the contracting authority to observe the procurement law throughout the procurement procedure.
To this end, it must provide sufficient documentation of the procedure.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar arrangements
Both countries have implemented EU rules on information and verification procedures.
In both countries, the awarding authority has to decide on the award of the contract.
However, it must not deviate arbitrarily from the result of a proper examination and evaluation of the offers.
The client shall grant the order within the time limit announced,
also because the bidders are no longer bound by their offers after the expiry of the deadline.
In the case of open and non-open procedures or public and limited tenders, the client may not deviate from the content of the offer when concluding the contract.
The losing bidders must be informed promptly of the decision to award the contract and of the reasons for not taking their offers into account.
Procurement procedures may only be lifted under certain conditions, e.g. if the bid prices are excessive or the offers do not meet the requirements of the call for tenders.
Different rules for Vonn
In the Czech Republic, the 10 or 15-day information and maintenance requirement prior to the award of the contract also applies to works not to be awarded throughout Europe.
In Germany, these requirements apply only to the area of EU-wide procurement.
In the case of the other procedures in Germany, bidders may only be informed of the award decision after the award has been made.
In the Czech Republic, a tendering procedure must be set aside if only one bid has been received or only one bid has been assessed.
In Germany, the contract must also be awarded in the case of a single valuable offer, provided that it complies with the conditions of the tender and is economic.
Key test results
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's top economic official said on Tuesday that the bloc's economic policy was "not fit for purpose" and that the bloc would not be able to meet its obligations under the bloc's bailout agreement.
Only in a few cases were there complaints with regard to the awarding of contracts examined at the conclusion of the procurement procedures.
In some cases, EU-wide procurement contracts have already been awarded to companies prior to the expiry of the information deadlines, which may result in the ineffectiveness of the contract.
According to open procedures, order letters also contained content that deviated from the content of the offer in individual cases, such as amended dates.
In several cases, the purchasers did not comply with the time limits.
In an open procedure, therefore, a contracting authority awarded the contract for the second cheapest offer, since a company with a 50% cheaper offer was no longer willing to carry out the services at the price originally offered after the end of the award period.
KNU-TV, KNBC-TV, reported that a woman was killed in the blast, which was caused by a car bomb.
In the case of a construction project in the field of higher education, the contracting authority deviated from the bidder's offer in the contract.
In the case of some contracts, for example in the case of road maintenance works, the construction of a motorway and a bypass, the contracting authorities concluded the contracts after the statutory deadline.
When awarding works for the refurbishment of the former military site, the contracting authority forwarded the notification of the award to all bidders only after the statutory deadline had expired.
A summary of the findings
Both countries have implemented the EU requirements at the end of the procurement procedure.
The legal protection of the losing candidates or bidders will increase the scope for the prevention of corruption.
Under Czech public procurement law, the scope of legal protection is also extended to awards below the EU thresholds.
In both countries, the deadlines for awarding contracts have been exceeded.
This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.
Building authorities should avoid the identified shortcomings in the conclusion of their procurement procedures in the future.
Documentation, reporting and reporting obligations
Procurement procedures must be documented in a comprehensible way during their individual stages with regard to the relevant findings as well as the reasons for the individual decisions.
In EU-wide procedures, the contracts awarded must be made known.
The order data is also recorded in an EU statistic.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption The documentation of procurement procedures implements a fundamental requirement of the EU-wide transparency requirement.
A carefully and promptly compiled documentation enables the procurement decisions to be traceable.
In particular, it also provides effective legal protection for bidders when awarding contracts above the EU thresholds.
Proper documentation is also an essential part of the fight against corruption, as the obligation to give detailed reasons for awarding contracts severely limits the scope for manipulation.
The notification of a contract awarded in an EU-wide procurement procedure shall be sent by the contracting authority to the EU's Office for Official Publications within 48 days.
The Office publishes the notices in the Official Journal of the EU and thus also implements the transparency requirement.
The contracting authorities will also have to collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and report it to the European Commission via the competent national ministries.
On this basis, the European Commission produces an annual EU statistic to provide an overview of the development of the internal market in construction services.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar arrangements
Both countries have fully transposed the EU rules on documentation and reporting requirements into national law.
The rules for documenting and reporting EU statistics are largely the same in both countries.
Different rules for Vonn
In the Czech Republic, the obligation to publish contracts awarded is not limited to EU-wide procurement, but also extends to other procurement procedures.
The notice period has been reduced to 15 days.
In Germany, in addition to the EU-wide awards, there is a publication obligation only for limited tenders and for freelance awards above value limits of 25,000 euros or 15,000 euros without VAT (so-called ex-post transparency).
Under these value limits and in the case of public tenders, only the companies involved in the competition procedure will receive information on the award of contracts.
Key test results
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's top economic official said on Tuesday that the bloc's economic policy was "not fit for purpose" and that the bloc would not be able to meet its obligations under the bloc's bailout agreement.
Documentation of the documentary
A large number of the tendering procedures examined were not fully documented.
The procurement notices did not contain all the necessary information, such as the reasons for product specifications or references to national regulations.
In an award procedure, the awarding authority did not justify why it awarded the contract to a company, even though its offer did not contain mandatory evidence.
In a few cases, the documents of the contracting authorities did not contain all the evidence necessary for the documentation of the procurement procedure.
Announcements of contracts
In some EU-wide procurement procedures, the awarding authorities failed to publicise the award of the contracts.
In the case of other procurement procedures, there was no evidence that the awarding authorities had publicised the contracts awarded.
Reporting and reporting obligations
The statistics presented contained the required minimum information. They had been prepared and sent out on time.
Ex-post transparency
In most cases, the audited building authorities published the order data of the completed tendering procedures.
However, due to a transmission error, this data was not published in the case of a building administration.
The building management noticed this error only after six months,
so that the contract data of the tendering procedures concluded by then were not published.
KNU-TV, KNBC-TV, reported that a woman was killed in the blast, which was caused by a car bomb.
Documentation of the documentary
In the case of construction work for the hosting of a major sporting event, the documentation of the procurement procedures showed considerable shortcomings, mainly due to incorrect information, such as incorrect bid prices in the minutes of the evaluation commissions.
In addition, some protocols of the offer openings were not signed.
Announcements of contracts
In the case of several road projects, notices of contracts awarded have been delayed or not published at all.
A summary of the findings
The rules on documentation and reporting and reporting requirements are broadly in line with those in both countries and implement EU requirements.
The transparency of procurement procedures, including the awarding of contracts, is thus guaranteed in principle.
The rules to be applied in the Czech Republic for the publication of notices go a little further than those in Germany.
The shortcomings identified in the documentation and in the announcements partially and substantially restricted the anti-corruption effect of these instruments in the relevant procurement procedures.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Building authorities should further improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and contracts and should fully comply with their reporting and reporting obligations.
Comprehensive evaluation and recommendations
The parallel audits of the NKÚ and the BRH have focused on two main areas, which in the Czech Republic and in Germany are essential for public procurement of works: the application of EU procurement rules and the prevention of corruption.
The requirements of EU law will enable cross-border competition to create a single European market.
Corruption prevention measures are not only aimed at preventing or at least reducing corruption; they are also aimed at preventing economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the state.
The auditing experience of the two Court of Auditors on the application of public procurement rules in both countries and the comparison of these rules reveals similarities and differences which may be helpful for both countries in developing their procurement law and its application.
Application of EU procurement rules
Both countries have transposed the EU's rules on the award of construction services into their national legislation.
In this way, the Czech Republic and Germany have an important common basis for awarding works and taking into account the essential competitive requirements, the equal treatment of the companies involved and the transparency of procurement procedures.
The building authorities of both countries have, in some cases very extensively, supplemented these bids with further administrative provisions.
The Czech Republic has also to a large extent transferred the requirements for construction services to be awarded throughout the EU to its nationally regulated procurement procedures below the EU threshold.
However, the investigations carried out by the Court of Auditors have shown that the building authorities have not fully complied with the requirements of EU law in all areas.
The building management in Germany should further improve the quality of its procurement procedures in order to be able to eliminate the problems identified in implementing the EU requirements.
In particular, the tests carried out in the Czech Republic have shown that there are risks to the economic viability of public procurement.
For example, incomplete performance descriptions required additional services, which were often awarded in violation of the law. Moreover, cost assessments were generally inadequately prepared. Excessive qualification requirements also reduced the number of potential bidders and restricted competition, especially in transport construction.
Preventing corruption
The aim of the investigations was not to uncover cases of corruption,
also because the Court of Auditors does not have the necessary instruments for this purpose.
However, the Court of Auditors can examine the extent to which the administrations of both countries have taken steps to prevent corruption and manipulation in the procurement of works and how these measures are applied.
Both countries have different priorities when it comes to preventing corruption.
In particular, the German rules provide for largely unrestricted competition, transparency and controls as key elements in the prevention of corruption.
The main aim of the Czech rules is to increase the transparency of procedures.
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's top economic official said on Tuesday that the bloc's economic policy was "not fit for purpose" and that the bloc would not be able to meet its obligations under the bloc's bailout agreement.
In Germany, general principles of corruption prevention apply, which are to be applied by the entire federal administration.
These principles are also implemented in the specifications for the award of construction services and are geared to their specific requirements.
The relevant rules set out, in part, very clearly, the way in which bids for the prevention of corruption must be taken into account in the running of the procurement procedures and in the selection of the persons involved.
In the opinion of the BRH, in particular, the primacy of the principle of open procedure or public tendering is an appropriate instrument for substantially reducing the risk of corruption in the awarding of works, while restrictions on competition increase the risk of manipulative interference.
Risk analysis and sufficient controls (in particular the "more eyes" principle), the requirements for transparency and documentation of procurement procedures as well as various organisational measures are also effective measures to prevent corruption and manipulation.
Therefore, the BRH does not see any need in principle to change the corresponding requirements of the administrations for the award of construction services.
The rules on the prevention of corruption are largely taken into account in practice.
The shortcomings identified in sub-sectors have highlighted shortcomings in the implementation of certain requirements.
Building authorities should continue to train their staff on the prevention of corruption and make them even more aware of this problem.
A substantial part of the complaints related to tasks delegated by the building authorities to freelancers.
However, without controls and sufficient safeguards, the risk of abuse increases when delegating tasks.
Therefore, tasks at risk of manipulation and corruption should only be entrusted to third parties if the administration can ensure a sufficient level of protection against unlawful interference.
KNU-TV, KNBC-TV, reported that a woman was killed in the blast, which was caused by a car bomb.
The Czech Republic adopted an anti-corruption strategy at government level, in which the area of public procurement is the main component.
The Procurement Act and its implementing provisions have been substantially amended.
The audits of NKÚ took place during the implementation of this strategy.
The strategy adopted and the new legal provisions are likely to be effective measures for improvement, as the contracting authorities will have to justify the profitability of the orders, the calculation of the expected prices, the adequacy of the qualification requirements, the essential evaluation criteria and the nature of the evaluations, and will have to document and publish all these aspects properly.
The recommendations include:
The NKÚ and the BRH give a generally positive assessment of the implementation of the EU requirements.
The widespread acceptance in practice has confirmed that EU bids for competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for the award of construction services within the European Union.
The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at facilitating and promoting cross-border competition.
In view of the enormous material and ideological potential for damage caused by manipulation and corruption in the provision of construction services, both Court of Auditors have called on the building authorities in their countries to continue and, if necessary, to improve their measures against corruption and manipulation.
In particular, the organisation and procedures of procurement procedures should be continuously examined for weaknesses and risks in order to identify the need for action and to be able to take appropriate countermeasures.
The comparison of procurement practices in both countries suggests that the share of open procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased, as open procedures offer a wider scope for competition and can significantly reduce the risk of corruption.
Greater division of building services into lots can also have a favourable effect on bid prices, provided that this results in greater competition with a higher number of bidders.
Ensuring the correct implementation of procurement procedures is an essential basis for efficient procurement by public purchasers.
In Germany, the procurement procedures are carried out by the specialised building authorities. In the Czech Republic, however, these tasks - with the exception of transport projects - are carried out by the departments themselves or by contractors commissioned by them.
The Court of Auditors of both countries has the concern, even after the conclusion of their joint project, to further develop the findings which are important to them in each case and, if necessary, to refer them to the parliament and government of their country.
Both Court of Auditors are also convinced that the principles of public procurement as set out in this report and its implementation are also of interest at international level to the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), because the principles and findings set out are of general importance in order to effectively combat corruption and to ensure the efficient award of construction services in a well-functioning and fair competition.

Football: Juve coach praises after top match: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker "played the best game this evening together with the half hour of Valencia," praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3-1 (1-1) victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive star was the decisive man in the important match against the pursuer, even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is doing well," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment on we grew.
Thanks to the three goals of Ronaldo, Juve turned the game after the early delay by the goal of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and hung the worst pursuer for the time being.
The goalkeeper brought in by Real Madrid first put on the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double pack (26 / 49.).
And Ronaldo also did the preparatory work for the goal of defense chief Leonardo Bonucci (76.) after a corner by header ball, who only had to push in shortly before the goal line.
"He gives many templates," praised the coach.
But Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record scorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We have to get even better at serving him," demanded the coach.
The best Juve goal scorer is currently Mandzukic with four goals - Ronaldo has three in his account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the superiority of Juventus seems to become even more overwhelming.

Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Celebrity guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 conferences until the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he will personally collect the tolerance prize in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after Wulff was a guest there.
This is how academy director Udo Hahn calculated him when he proudly said: "All Federal Presidents and Federal Chancellors have already been with us." However, the fact that celebrities repeatedly appear at the academy in Tutzing Castle was also a topic during the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, songwriter Konstantin Wecker takes part in a conference on spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective, and on 29 September the writer Frido Mann takes part in a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.

Music Cabaret: Gender Understanding with Heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret artist, Teubner imagined gender understanding, not only with humour and warmth of heart for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and what else there might be, but also with music.
She used the mini-guitar and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp sat on the wing.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes speaks until the end of the movement, and on the other hand, a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner accompanies him so congenially and harmoniously that some may have wished for a solo.
This was also the case, with Beethoven and Chopin, but in a different way, namely as it suited the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had brought a paradox into play: the satisfaction of the man comes when he has a partner, but she does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, would be of no use.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: what would have arisen from composing Mozart if "Das Nannerl" had unexpectedly opened the door?
Thus Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" to the "Lied vom Tod," and from Mozart's G minor symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, presented flowers to the chansonette.

Management of VAT in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Report on the audit
The foreword:
Taxes are the main source of revenue for public budgets.
A focus of the work of the Court of Auditors should therefore be on examining this area.
This applies in particular to VAT fraud.
This alone is estimated to result in annual tax losses of EUR 100 billion in the European Union.
As early as the 6th EUROSAI Congress in Bonn in 2005, the participants stressed the need for enhanced cooperation.
This makes it possible for the Court of Auditors, for example, to exchange audit approaches and to optimise audit practice.
The VAT (VAT) is particularly suitable for cooperation as it is harmonised within the European Union.
In 2006, for the first time, the Court of Auditors of both countries carried out parallel audits in the field of VAT.
The corresponding audit report was published in 2008.
As USt fraud is a widespread phenomenon in the European Union, close cooperation between the Court of Auditors is needed to comprehensively assess the effectiveness of the measures taken to combat USt fraud.
The two Court of Auditors decided to continue their cooperation and carried out a second parallel audit. Administration of VAT in the Czech Republic and in the Federal Republic of Germany Report on the audit
1. Introduction
Examination number: (CZ) 09 / 11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892
Subject of examination: (CZ) Management of the USt (D) Bilateral audit with the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic (hereinafter NKÚ), Audit
The audit target is:
(CZ) Examination should be made of the USt administration and the treatment of selected transactions between entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic (hereinafter CZ) and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter Germany). Furthermore, the procedures used by the financial authorities in the case of intergovernmental assistance should be investigated.
(D) The purpose of the audit was to evaluate how the financial administration has implemented the recommendations made by the Court of Auditors.
Further examination fields linked to the USt should also be processed.
The findings of this study should be compared in order to determine whether taxation procedures can be optimised.
The period covered by the audit was 2006 to 2008, including relevant information from the period before the audit until the audit was completed.
2. Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel examination
The Courts of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have agreed on a control audit of the administration of the USt.
In the previous parallel investigation, they had uncovered suspected cases involving intra-Community transactions,
which made a re-examination seem expedient.
Based on the findings of the audit, the two Court of Auditors made recommendations on the administration of the USt.
The aim of the inspection was to evaluate how these recommendations were implemented and to investigate the suspected cases identified.
The audit also dealt with other matters, including selected cases of risky intra-Community transactions, mutual assistance in the recovery of USt claims and the USt audit of large companies.
The Court of Auditors has found that:
1. Recommendations made on the basis of the previous examination
• Recommendation 1: Rules for the registration of taxable persons should be harmonised within the EU
In the first audit, the Court of Auditors compared the registration procedures for the USt in the two countries and found differences that caused problems.
The Court of Auditors therefore recommended harmonising the registration of taxable persons within the EU.
This has also been taken up at EU level.
The draft amendment to Council Regulation No 1798 / 2003 provides for the extension of the existing databases in the EU, including a database with the identification number of those subject to USt.
The draft also provided for common rules for the registration of taxable persons and their possible deletion.
The Court of Auditors expected Member States to agree, in line with its decision in principle, on appropriate arrangements to remove unreliable traders from the USt system as early as possible.
The Member States reached political agreement in ECOFIN on the final version of the draft.
The aforementioned common rules are no longer included, and the two Court of Auditors regret this.
They continue to believe that such arrangements are important in order to prevent VAT fraud.
• Recommendation 2: Monthly presentation of the Summary Notices As a result of the initial examination, the Court of Auditors recommended to the Member States that in future Comprehensive Notices (TIAs) should be submitted monthly.
The amounts of intra-Community transactions could then be reviewed more closely.
Council Directive 2008 / 117 / EC amending Directive 2006 / 112 / EC on the common system of value added tax (VAT) for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions has reduced the deadline for the levying of VAT to one month.
In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by an amendment to the USt Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.
In Germany, the implementation only came into force on 1 July 2010. Thus, the obligation to make a monthly payment of the ZM has not been transposed into national law in time.
• Recommendation 3: Data matching of USt pre-registrations and ZM in Germany for more reliable MIAS data and proposal to examine the pooling of procedures for USt pre-registrations and ZM The German financial administration has taken up the recommendation issued by the Bundesrechnungshof and has set up a working group to develop possible solutions.
Work has not yet been completed.
The Bundesrechnungshof will monitor the further development.
• Recommendation 4: Exchange of successful criteria, components and approaches for a risk management system at EU level In the course of the initial examination, the two Court of Auditors agreed that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by a Member State alone.
Successful criteria as well as elements or approaches to a risk management system must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State.
If this does not happen, fraudsters will focus on the Member State with the weakest risk management system.
The Court of Auditors found that the two Member States have different risk management systems which have both strengths and weaknesses.
The NKU examined the system of information exchange within the EU - EUROCANET, while the Bundesrechnungshof focused on the German participation in the "Platform for Risk Management."
2. Verification of selected intra-Community transactions
In the first audit, the Court of Auditors jointly examined transactions where it was doubtful whether they had actually been carried out or which had been declared differently by the taxable persons of the two States in the USt declarations (e.g. USt declarations) or ZM.
The Court of Auditors selected nine cases of intra-Community supplies of goods between the CZ and Germany for the audit.
The audits carried out by the Financial Offices (FÄ) of both States were not completed at the conclusion of the first parallel audit.
The audit showed that the tax procedures for these selected transactions had now been completed, and that the respective tax administrations had taken appropriate measures (including retrospective VAT fixing or the prevention of pre-tax refunds).
3. Examination of selected, particularly risky intra-Community transactions
The audit also included high-risk intra-Community transactions between EU taxpayers covered by the EUROCANET system.
EUROCANET is used to identify risky taxpayers.
Member States can participate in this system on a voluntary basis.
The CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET. Germany has a passive status, i.e. it does not participate in the exchange of data within EUROCANET.
From the point of view of an active participant state, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States are refusing to take part.
This meant that no information could be obtained about which suppliers with German USt-ID would have been classified as high-risk cases.
The NKU found both normal business incidents and those suspected of USt fraud, including carousel fraud, in the selected sales.
The FÄ were only able to carry out limited checks on high-risk transactions, in particular on so-called "missing traders," whereby an examination of the documents alone is hardly sufficient to prove fraud to the taxable person.
Suspect of carousel fraud in imports and exports
it is recommended that customs and tax authorities work more closely together in order to be able to track the usefulness of the goods and their actual transport within the EU to the final consumer.
Germany and a number of other countries have refused to participate actively in EUROCANET, arguing that it does not have a sufficient legal basis.
The Bundesrechnungshof found that the German tax administration uses other instruments to identify high-risk taxpayers.
However, there is a need for communication and exchange of experience between all EU Member States.
The Council of the EU agreed on a draft Regulation,
was created by EUROFISC.
The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should feed into the planned network to combat USt fraud.
4.Mutual assistance in the recovery of claims
Interstate assistance for the recovery of claims is subject to the same European legislation in all Member States.
For this reason, requests for intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in the CZ and Germany are dealt with in the same way.
The Bundesrechnungshof and NKU compared the statistics sent to the European Commission by both Member States for the years 2006 to 2008.
There were discrepancies in these statistics.
The two Court of Auditors believe that it would be useful to discuss statistics at EU level again in order to avoid future discrepancies.
If this does not happen, the statistics cannot be used appropriately for comparisons.
In addition, the statistics should contain more information on the USt.
Analysis of detailed data can make it easier for the Commission to support Member States in their efforts to combat USt fraud.
Both Court of Auditors consider that Member States with a low recovery rate should strive to achieve at least the average recovery rate.
The Commission should support the Member States in this, if it so wishes.
5. USt-Examination for Large Enterprises
The Court of Auditors analysed the legal situation regarding the audit of large companies in both countries.
In addition, they used a questionnaire to collect information from financial administrations which they considered important in this context.
This showed clearly that the situation in both countries is different.
For the selection of high-risk cases, the CZ has a system that includes a large amount of relevant data (including information on USt audits, balance sheet data and profit and loss statements).
The overall USt control can thus be effectively controlled and analyzed.
A special Financial Office for large enterprises is to be set up in 2012.
Germany does not yet have a comparable system. This makes the overall control and analysis of the USt control more difficult.
The German tax administration focuses more on the selection of relevant individual cases and relies in particular on data from the USt pre-registrations and / or the USt declarations and the ZM.
Various risk management components, which are still to be improved, support the evaluation of this data.
3 in the review process.
3.1 Examination procedure in the Czech Republic
Department II - State Revenue and Regional Departments IX Pilsen, X České Budějovice, XIII Brno and XV Ostrava carried out audits between May 2009 and February 2010.
Verified bodies were the Czech Ministry of Finance and 25 FÄ: Tax Office (FA) Brno II, FA Brno III, FA Brno IV, FA in Břeclav, FA in Domažlice, FA in Hodonín, FA in Hradec Králové, FA in Cheb, FA in Jablonec nad Nisou, FA in Karlovy Vary, FA in Karlovy Vary, FA in Kralupy nad Vltavou, FA in Kraslice, FA in Ostrava I FA, FA Ostrava III, FA in Písek, FA Pilsen in Prague, FA 1, FA FA 4 FA Prague, FA 8 FA in Rakovník, FA in Sokolov, FA in Zamberto FA in Zlín in Zamberto FA, FA in Zákín in Sokín and FA in Zamberto FA.
The Senate of the Czech Court of Auditors approved the audit findings on 27 April 2010.
3.2 Testing procedures in Germany
The examination area Traffic Taxes and employees of the assigned PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt / Main and Munich tested from February 2009 to February 2010.
After selecting the sample cases, they announced the examination in several countries:
• Bavaria, • Hamburg, • Hesse, • North Rhine-Westphalia, • Saxony. In addition, they conducted interviews in the Federal Ministry of Finance.
Tax files from the following FÄ were included in the audit: • Erlangen, Central Tax Office Munich, Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in the Upper Palatinate, Grafenau; • Hamburg-North, Hamburg-Hansa, Special Tax Office Hamburg for large enterprises; • Wiesbaden I, Wiesbaden II, Darmstadt; • Essen-NordOst, FA Essen for tax audits at large companies and corporations, Lüdenscheid; • Chemnitz-Süd.
Discussions were also held with the FÄ Mühlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Süd and the OFD Frankfurt / Main, Chemnitz and Münster.
The Bundesrechnungshof informed the Federal Ministry of Finance of the audit results in April 2010.
3.3 Cooperation between the two Court of Auditors
In the run-up to the parallel audit, representatives of both Court of Auditors met in September 2008 to discuss and define the audit topics.
In December 2008, the Presidents of both Court of Auditors signed the Memorandum of Understanding on co-operation in the parallel audit.
At a meeting in Bonn in June 2009, the examination teams discussed the initial results obtained during the preparation of the examination, discussed possible approaches to the examination and agreed on the way forward.
A second meeting took place from 2 to 4 December 2009 in Prague.
The examination teams exchanged the knowledge gained up to then and agreed on the timetable for the preparation of the joint audit report.
The two Court of Auditors set out the following issues for their parallel audit: • Evaluation of the recommendations made in the previous report; • Review of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between CZ and German taxpayers, which could not be fully clarified during the first parallel audit; • Review of selected intra-Community transactions classified as risky between CZ and Germany taxpayers; • Examination of the procedures of the two tax administrations regarding inter-governmental assistance in the recovery of USt receivables; • USt audits of large companies.
The report on the results of the parallel audit was prepared during a working meeting in June 2010.
4. Examination of the administration of VAT in selected areas
4.1 Implementation of recommendations from the first joint audit
4.1.1 Implementation of recommendations in the Czech Republic
Recommendation 1
Harmonisation of the conditions for the registration of taxable persons within the EU
Based on the results of the first audit, the Czech Court of Auditors has recommended that the requirements for VAT registration be adjusted and that new rules be introduced for deletion of registration in the CZ.
These amended rules should be more effective in reducing the risk of possible tax evasion.
In certain cases it was found that the FÄ did not delete the VAT registration of taxable persons if they did not fulfil their obligations under Czech Law No. 235 / 2004 (hereinafter referred to as the "USt Act").
To date, the Czech Ministry of Finance has not submitted any amendment to oblige the FÄ to delete if taxpayers repeatedly fail to file USt declarations.
In accordance with the Czech USt Act, the FA may cancel the registration of a taxable person of its own accord if a) the taxable person has not made any transactions for twelve consecutive months and has not informed the FA of the reasons for doing so; b) the taxable person has not fulfilled his obligations under the USt Act; c) the taxable person no longer fulfils the requirements of the tax obligation.
The first examination showed that the FA Prague 1, due to the existing legal situation, has to cancel the USt registration of "foreign taxable persons" 3 with effect from 31 January of the following calendar year, if they were not obliged to register and pay USt in the current calendar year.
The FA Prague 1 often did not delete the USt registration of these taxable persons because the relevant provision of the time limit could not be adequately implemented in practice.
The problem was solved by the amendment of the USt Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2009.
Accordingly, the FA has the power to cancel the registration of a foreign taxable person if he has not delivered goods or services which are not taxable or exempt from tax in the previous calendar year and are entitled to a deduction.
Recommendation 2
Monthly levy of VAT
On the basis of the first audit, the Court of Auditors had recommended that the monthly levy of VAT should be introduced.
The Council Directive, which shortened the cycle for the levy to one month, was implemented in the CZ by the USt Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.
The ZM must now be delivered electronically.
In addition, if services whose place of performance is to be determined in accordance with § 9 (1) USt Law are provided for a person registered in a Member State other than that which is subject to VAT, a customs clearance must be provided.
The condition is that the recipient is obliged to declare and pay for the USt for these services, which is the result of Council Directive 2008 / 8 / EC amending Directive 2006 / 112 / EC as regards the place of the service.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of data from the USt pre-registrations and the ZM to increase the reliability of the MIAS data This recommendation referred to the German tax administration.
In its ATIS4 system, the Czech tax administration automatically compares data on intra-Community transactions from the USt declarations and the ZM.
Recommendation 4
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level
The proper collection of VAT is a sine qua non for the proper functioning of the EU internal market.
That is why the fight against USt fraud is of paramount interest and has received considerable attention in recent years.
The importance of this is borne out, among other things, by a study published by the European Commission in October 2009.
An external expert estimated the USt shortfall for the 25 Member States between 2000 and 2006. Based on the evaluation of the available data, the tax shortfall for this period has been estimated at EUR 90 to 113 billion, based on the fact that the EU-25 loses an average of 12% of the sales taxes due to them each year.
The estimated tax loss for the CZ in 2006 was 18%.
The first assessment found that a Member State alone cannot develop an effective risk management system (RMS).
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each Member State.
With regard to the RMS, the Czech Court of Auditors has examined the EU Information Exchange System (EUROCANET).
For this purpose, intra-Community transactions carried out by EU taxpayers and covered by EUROCANET have been selected (see Chapter 4.3).
The aim of the EUROFISC network is to optimise mutual assistance in tax matters and to combat US fraud more effectively, and to improve cooperation between the competent authorities in order to identify fraud cases as early as possible.
EUROFISC could later be used as a tool to assess the risk potential of intra-Community transactions.
The Ecofin Council approved EUROFISC on 7 October 2008 and, at the same time, adopted the principles for the functioning of the system.
EUROCANET, which has been developed by the Belgian tax administration in cooperation with the other Member States and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF7, serves as a model for EUROFISC.
The purpose of the system is to detect risky transactions and to identify entrepreneurs involved in organised USt fraud.
4.1.2 Implementation of the recommendations in Germany
The evaluation of the recommendations of the first report found that:
Recommendation 1
Harmonisation of the conditions for the registration of taxable persons within the EU
On the basis of a detailed questionnaire, the German tax administration has developed a well-functioning system for the registration of taxable persons.
The Federal Ministry of Finance presented this system to the Commission in October 2007.
The system itself is constantly improving.
The data provided in the questionnaire will now be collected electronically and will be available for research later on. They are therefore part of the risk management at the time of registration.
The Commission had made a Proposal 8 amending Regulation 1798 / 2003, which included common standards for the registration and deletion of taxable persons.
The Member States still needed clarification and clarification on this point.
The Bundesrechnungshof had recommended to the Federal Ministry of Finance that it should not fall behind the standards already achieved.
Recommendation 2
Monthly levy of VAT
On 8 April 2010, a bill 9 was adopted to transpose the EU directives into national law.
It contains, among other things, provisions on the monthly levy of VAT on intra-Community supplies.
and will enter into force on 1 July 2010.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of data of USt pre-registrations and ZM for more reliable MIAS data and reflection on the merging of the previously separate procedures for issuing USt pre-registrations and the ZM
A joint federal-state working group has been set up,
which has developed a concept for the automatic synchronization of data from the USt pre-registrations and the ZM.
The concept is still under discussion with the countries.
This working group has also looked at an approach to optimising the control procedure for intra-Community transactions.
Recommendation 4
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level Information on this issue will be exchanged at EU level.
Germany participates in the Risk Management Platform.
The European Commission supported this initiative and initiated the creation of a risk management platform within the Fiscalis 2006-2007 Action Plan in the written procedure of 18 October 2006.
The members of the platform dealt with the following topics in 4 subgroups: • Risk Management Instruments, • Influencing the behavior of taxpayers, • Evaluation, • Updating the Risk Management Guide.
New reports by the "Risk Management Instruments" and "Updating the Risk Management Guide" subgroups were published in early 2010.
4.1.3 Evaluation
Registration is required.
The question of the conditions for USt registration and its deletion in various countries has been dealt with at EU level.
The draft Council Regulation 1798 / 2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT and repealing Regulation (EEC) 218 / 92 provides for the extension of existing databases within the EU, including a database of USt identification numbers.
This proposal also includes common standards for the registration and deletion of taxable persons.
The issues of registration and deletion are, for the time being, subject to the national legislation of the EU Member States.
The Member States still needed clarification and clarification on this point.
The Bundesrechnungshof had recommended to the Federal Ministry of Finance not to fall behind the standards already achieved.
The Member States reached political agreement on the final version of the draft at Ecofin on 8 June 2010.
Common rules for the registration and deletion of taxable persons are no longer included.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The two Court of Auditors regret this and believe that such arrangements are still important in order to prevent VAT fraud.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Monthly levy of VAT
With regard to international cooperation, as a result of the previous audit, it was recommended that all Member States introduce the monthly levy of the SDR in order to allow for an earlier examination of the amounts of intra-Community transactions.
The Council Regulation 2008 / 117 / EC amending the Directive 2006 / 112 / EC on the common system of value added tax (VAT) for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions has shortened the period for the levying of the corresponding VAT rate to one month.
In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by the amendment of the USt Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.
Germany did not implement the commitment to the monthly ZM levy until 1 July 2010 and thus not in time, while the CZ complied with the requirements of the EU.
Comparison of data of USt pre-registrations and ZM for more reliable MIAS data and reflection on the merging of previously separate procedures for submitting USt pre-registrations and ZM
The German tax administration has taken up the recommendations of the Bundesrechnungshof and has set up a working group to develop possible solutions.
The Bundesrechnungshof will monitor the further development.
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level
Germany and the CZ use different approaches to identify risky entrepreneurs.
The Czech Court of Auditors examined the application of the EUROCANET system in CZ (see Section 4.3).
The Bundesrechnungshof focused on the German participation in the risk management platform.
4.2 Verification of selected intra-Community transactions
The first audit carried out jointly examined transactions where there were doubts as to whether they had actually been carried out or where inconsistencies had been found in the notifications of taxpayers in both Member States.
The two Court of Auditors selected nine cases of intra-Community consignments of goods between the CZ and Germany for the audit in which the tax audit by the FÄ of the Member State concerned had not yet been completed at the time of the previous joint audit.
1) There's no getting away from the fact that there's a lot of people out there who don't know what's going on.
In the first quarter of 2005, a Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth €22 686 from a German taxable person.
The Czech taxable person did not declare the acquisition in his USt declaration, since the German taxable person did not have a USt identification number for that period, but only a tax number for intra-German transactions.
By means of international administrative assistance pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the competent Czech FA had received information that according to German law, the supplier of intra-Community goods does not need a USt identification number in order to benefit from the tax exemption of intra-Community goods deliveries.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that, according to the audit carried out by the competent Czech FA, the Czech taxable person submitted an additional declaration declaring the purchase of goods of the above value, while at the same time claiming the same amount of deduction.
2) There's no getting away from the fact that there's a lot of people out there who don't know what's going on.
A Czech taxpayer is alleged to have purchased goods worth €12,561 from a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004.
However, he stated that he had not purchased the goods and therefore had not explained them in his USt statement.
The German tax administration, citing a provision of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, refused to process the request because the turnover associated with the acquisition did not exceed the threshold of EUR 15 000.
As the Czech FA was unable to obtain documents, the tax audit was inconclusive and the original tax determination remained in place.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech FA received from Germany two spontaneous declarations under Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, according to which the German taxpayer had charged a Slovak addressee for the delivery of the goods in question.
The Czech taxable person purchased the goods from the Slovak taxable person and stated the purchase in his regular USt declaration for the month of October 2004.
3) There's no getting away from the fact that there's a lot of people out there who don't know what's going on.
A Czech taxpayer is alleged to have purchased a car worth 48 500 euros from a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004.
However, it did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.
In addition, he had not issued a USt statement since August 2004. Therefore, the FA set the USt at 0 CZK for the quarter in question.
In March 2007, on the basis of information transmitted from Germany as part of the international exchange of information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the FA asked the taxable person to file a subsequent tax return, but the taxable person failed to do so.
The audit found that in 2007 the FA had carried out further audits in this tax case, finding that the car in question had been sold by the taxable person to a used car dealer in the CZ.
The Czech FA introduced a predisposition for the December 2004 tax period, setting additional taxes of CZK 295 379 for the purchase and resale of goods from another Member State.
The competent Czech court decided to open insolvency proceedings concerning the assets of the Czech taxable person; an insolvency administrator was appointed.
In the absence of significant assets, the outstanding tax liability is likely to be unrecoverable.
4) There's no getting away from the fact that there's a lot of people who don't know what's going on.
In the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, a Czech taxpayer is alleged to have delivered new vehicles (passenger cars) to Germany with a total value of EUR 198 167.
The reply to a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 stated that the German taxable person was subject to criminal proceedings in Germany.
The audit carried out by the Bundesrechnungshof concluded that there was evidence that the German taxable person was involved in fraud.
The intra-Community purchase of goods was subject to taxation of the amount of EUR 182 424 (for 2004) and EUR 369 690 (for 2005).
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech taxpayer was involved in carousel fraud involving new vehicles.
On the basis of information provided by the German tax administration, a VAT audit of the Czech taxable person took place for the April, May and June 2005 tax periods.
Based on the findings of the audit and information from the international exchange of information, the FA set an additional USt of 703 031 CZK for May 2005 and 726 551 CZK for June 2005.
5) There's no getting away from the fact that there's a lot of people out there who don't know what's going on.
The Czech taxpayer A is alleged to have purchased a machine with a total value of EUR 58 000 from a German taxpayer in February 2005.
In the third quarter of 2004, the German taxable person allegedly supplied the Czech taxable person B with a machine worth 88 027 euros. However, B denied the purchase.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that B had acquired the machine from a German company established in CZ.
The Czech taxable person A did not state the purchase of the goods from the named German taxable person in his USt declaration.
The German FA's reply to a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 showed that the German taxable person had not made an intra-Community delivery of a machine worth EUR 58 000, but a delivery within the CZ.
In the audit, the Bundesrechnungshof found that the intra-Community delivery of the machine was classified as domestic after the completion of an operational test and the USt exemption was subsequently denied.
6) There is no question that the United States is the world's largest economy, and that the United States is the world's largest economy.
In the third quarter of 2004, a German taxpayer allegedly delivered goods worth 11 600 euros to a Czech taxpayer.
The goods were purchased and later, i.e. in 2005, sold in Germany.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech FA had carried out its assessment on the basis of a supplementary USt declaration, which showed unauthorised acquisitions from another Member State, including acquisitions in the above amount.
The Bundesrechnungshof found that after receiving a reply to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the German FA corrected the German taxable person's USt declaration and set an additional USt of EUR 1 600.
Due to the resale of the goods in Germany and the corresponding USt disposition there, an investigation is under way.
The ZM of the German taxable person has not been corrected so far, as in Germany only the taxable person who has given the ZM can correct it.
7) There is no question that the United States is the most dangerous country in the world, and that the United States is the world's most dangerous country.
The competent Czech FA received a request for information from the German tax administration in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 on the question of the purchase of a car worth EUR 47 400 by a Czech taxable person in February 2005.
After an examination for the 2005 tax period, the Czech FA determined the tax liability of the Czech taxable person at 0 CZK and informed the German FA that it could not confirm the acquisition of the car by the Czech taxable person.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the registration of the Czech USt debtor had been cancelled because he had not fulfilled his tax obligations.
The Czech FA had forwarded the documents to the Czech police.
The German taxable person has so far not corrected his details in the ZM, but has appealed against the tax decision.
(8) The National Weather Service has issued a winter storm warning for parts of the Northeast and Midwest, and the National Weather Service has issued a flash flood warning for parts of the Midwest and Midwest.
According to MIAS10, between the third quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, a German taxable person supplied goods to a Czech taxable person with a total value of EUR 33 205, which he did not declare as intra-Community acquisition.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors found that the reasons for the discrepancies were investigated by the Czech FA.
For the first quarter of 2005, the Czech taxable person repeatedly made subsequent USt declarations.
However, the Czech FA was unable to clarify the difference of 134 CZK to 273 CZK between the third quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005. It justified this on the grounds that revenues for individual quarters could not be accurately attributed and accepted the USt declarations issued.
(9) The National Weather Service has issued a winter storm warning for parts of the Northeast and Midwest.
In the third quarter of 2004, a German taxable person had delivered goods to a Czech taxable person worth EUR 46 854.
For the same period, the Czech taxable person declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only €14 856.
In the context of the intergovernmental exchange of information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the Czech FA verified the actual value of the delivery.
With the German reply to this request, three invoices were sent showing a total value of the goods delivered of EUR 31 998, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech taxable person and the MIAS data.
According to the results of the audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors, the Czech taxpayer, following repeated warnings from the FA, submitted a supplementary declaration of VAT for the July 2004 tax period in January 2007.
With this declaration, the taxable person simultaneously asserted his right to a deduction. Therefore, his tax liability for the relevant tax period remained unchanged.
The audit confirmed that most of the tax procedures relating to the transactions selected for the audit had been completed and that the financial administrations in the CZ and in Germany had taken appropriate measures (inter alia, retrospective VAT fixing or prevention of pre-tax refunds).
4.3 Examination of selected cases of risky intra-Community transactions
4.3.1 Findings in the Czech Republic
EUROCANET can be an important source of information to identify taxable persons at risk in the Member State of purchase.
In the CZ, the early warning information derived from EUROCANET is reviewed by the competent FA in the case of the acquirers.
Since the first quarter of 2008, the CZ has introduced information on sales and taxable suppliers, which are considered to be risky, into the EUROCANET system.
Nine Czech taxpayers have been selected for the audit,
which had been entered into EUROCANET by the financial administrations of other Member States either as suppliers or acquirers.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
As the German tax administration did not participate in the data exchange via EUROCANET, it was not possible to determine whether suppliers with German USt identification number were considered to be high risk by the German tax administration.
The audit identified both normal business incidents and those suspected of carousel fraud or other USt fraud.
In the cases in question, the FÄ exchanged information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003,
For example: B.
• The FÄ found no suspicions of risky transactions when examining the early warning information.
The taxpayers concerned were constantly monitored because their data was stored in EUROCANET.
• The FÄ s did not succeed in verifying the fraudulent transactions on the basis of the accounting documents submitted, in spite of the fact that they found discrepancies in the transport and storage of the goods or in the business relations with letterbox companies from other Member States.
• The verification of individual business cases was complicated because certain taxpayers did not cooperate with the FÄ and could not be contacted.
The competent FÄ audited most of the taxable persons and transactions identified in EUROCANET's early warning reports.
However, their ability to verify risky transactions, especially so-called "missing traders," is limited.
In particular, a mere examination of the documents can hardly provide evidence of fraudulent action by the taxable person.
Stricter requirements for the registration of taxpayers for USt purposes and greater flexibility in deleting registrations would be helpful in combating USt fraud.
Taxpayers involved in fraudulent carousel transactions can be registered for USt purposes, in order to fool EU-wide fictitious goods deliveries or to issue formally correct tax documents to other taxpayers, with which they can then claim unjustified claims for deduction of VAT.
In the event of suspected carousel fraud in connection with imports and exports, it is recommended that customs and tax authorities cooperate more closely in order to be able to track the usefulness of the goods and their actual transport within the EU to the final consumer.
Member States can participate in EUROCANET on a voluntary basis.
The absence of three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) was seen by the European Parliament at the end of 2008 as a weakness in the system, which should be remedied by the establishment of a EUROFISC network with compulsory participation.
4.3.2 Determinations in Germany
The Bundesrechnungshof evaluated data available at the Federal Central Office of Taxation, including data from EUROCANET.
They served as the basis for the selection of six German taxpayers whose files were checked.
Both Germany and a number of other countries refused to participate actively in EUROCANET.
That is why Germany has a passive status, that is, it does not send data to Brussels itself, but is only the recipient of EUROCANET data.
This is justified by the fact that "from the point of view of the federal government:
There is no unambiguous legal basis [exists] that would allow us to break the tax secrecy that exists in Germany.
In addition, the Federal Government does not have reliable information on how information sent by the Member States is processed within the framework of EUROCANET. "12 Since October 2007, the Federal Central Office of Taxation has been evaluating the EUROCANET data and communicating it to the federal and state tax authorities on the basis of a coordinated procedure.
The German FÄ will receive control notifications concerning the direct business relations of the taxable persons registered with EUROCANET with companies from other EU countries.
However, the German FA will receive no information as to whether the company from the other EU Member State mentioned above has a business relationship with a company established in another Member State which is also linked to the German company from the Control Notice.
4.3.3 Evaluation
The CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has only a passive status.
From the point of view of an active participant, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States are refusing to take part.
Accordingly, the audit had to be carried out differently in this area.
However, it has not been possible to identify significant differences in the success in detecting USt fraud due to the fact that EUROCANET is only one component of the risk management system.
However, the financial administrations of both countries have many other tools at their disposal to detect fraudulent transactions. Nevertheless, it is necessary to develop a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.
The Council of the European Union agreed on draft Regulation 13 establishing EUROFISC, a network for combating USt fraud.
Experience gained so far with EUROCANET should be shared by Member States at European level and incorporated into this network.

The cases brought at national and European level show that a discussion between the Member States and the Commission on the conditions for the exemption of intra-Community transactions is necessary.
4.4 Mutual support for the recovery of claims
4.4.1 Interstate assistance for the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic
The legislation on inter-governmental assistance for the recovery of certain claims in the EU is essentially based on:
Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as levies and duties;
Council Directive 2001 / 44 / EC amending Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, levies and duties, VAT and certain excise duties; and
Commission Directive 2002 / 94 / EC laying down detailed rules for the implementation of certain articles of Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to certain taxes, duties, taxes and other measures.
The CZ implemented Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC by means of Law Nr. 252 / 2000 on intergovernmental administrative assistance for the recovery of certain claims.
After the adoption of Council Directive 2001 / 44 / EC, it was also necessary to transpose this into Czech law. At the same time, an amendment of the above law was necessary.
In this context, legislative amendment No. 191 / 2004 concerning intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of certain claims was adopted.
A significant new piece of legislation was adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1179 / 2008 of 28 November 2008.
The annexes to this Regulation contain new application forms to be used from 1 January 2009. Furthermore, the Regulation makes electronic transmission compulsory and requires the requesting authority to certify the conformity of all documents sent with the respective original.
The main principles of international assistance for the recovery of claims are:
1. The principle of reciprocity applies;
2. Mutual assistance shall only be provided upon request and in the fulfilment of all conditions;
3. Administrative assistance does not extend to claims which are considered as a criminal penalty in the requested State;
4. The procedure for inter-governmental assistance for the recovery of claims must be carried out in accordance with the national law of the requested State;
5. In the recovery procedure, foreign claims do not take precedence over domestic claims;
6. Administrative assistance is provided only for the collection of undisputed claims;
7. The principle of utilisation shall apply: the requesting State shall use all means at its disposal under national law to recover the claim.
Law Nr. 191 / 2004 provides for three forms of administrative assistance: provision of information, notification of legal acts and actual collection.
Procedure for outgoing requests to other EU Member States
The competent FA has to transmit the request for information, the request for notification of legal acts or the request for collection, together with the relevant documents, electronically via the respective Financial Directorate, to the Ministry of Finance of the CZ.
The Ministry of Finance of the CZ arranges the translation of the request into the language in question, scans it with all attachments and transmits it via the communication network or the CCN / CSI common interface of the competent fiscal authority of the State concerned.
A request for recovery aid must meet the following conditions: the claim must exceed EUR 1 500 and must not be older than five years.
The requested authority may refuse recovery if the requirements are not met.
Procedure for receiving requests from other Member States
The receipt of requests from other Member States must be confirmed by the CZ's Ministry of Finance as soon as possible, at the latest within seven days.
If it decides not to grant the request, it must inform the requesting authority of the reasons for the refusal, citing the specific provisions of the directive on which it is based.
The corresponding communication shall be sent no later than three months after the date of receipt of the confirmation of receipt of the request.
Upon receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance will assess whether the request fulfils all legal requirements.
The request shall then be transmitted to the competent FA via the relevant Financial Directorate. If the request for collection is granted, the FA shall, among other things, determine the debtor's assets, e.g. by extracts from the Land Registry, inquiring about existing bank accounts and registration of motor vehicles with the registration office.
After six months from the receipt date of the receipt confirmation of the request, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ shall inform the requesting authority of the outcome of the enquiry.
The requesting authority must also be informed if the taxable persons concerned are not reachable and the claim cannot therefore be settled.
All sums successfully contributed must be transferred to the requesting authority within one month of the successful recovery.
The Czech FA concerned with the recovery may, with the consent of the requesting State, agree to the demand for overtime or instalment payment.
Interest or default surcharges imposed on the debtor for the period of delay pursuant to Law No. 337 / 1992 concerning the management of taxes and fees
We stand with the requesting state.
In particular, in 2006 and 2007, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ sent the relevant FA delayed requests for recovery.
The same was true for the forwarding of the requests for recovery made by the Czech authorities to the competent authority in the requested State.
The audit found that the Ministry of Finance had breached the law on intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of claims by failing to inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the state of play of the recovery procedure within six months of confirmation of receipt of the request.
The situation has improved since 2008.
Statistical data
In accordance with § 13 (4) of Law 191 / 2004, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ shall prepare a statistic for the European Commission until 15 March each year. This statistic contains the number of requests for information, notification of legal acts and collection, including the amount of the respective receivables, submitted in the previous year itself and received.
On the basis of the data provided by the Member States, the European Commission is preparing its report to the Council and the European Parliament on the application of the provisions on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims.
The audit showed that in 2008, the CZ Ministry of Finance (Ministry of Finance) understated the claims by 5 250,000 euros due to an incorrect indication of the amount of a USt claim filed in 2008 (caused by the deferral of a decimal point in the conversion of the claim of Czech crowns into euros).
The error was subsequently reflected in the statistics of the European Commission.
Information on mutual recovery assistance is presented in the table below.
4.4.2 Interstate assistance in the recovery of claims in Germany
The legal basis for intergovernmental assistance in tax matters is the Community standards Council Directive 2008 / 55 / EC of 26 May 2008 (EC Recovery Directive) 14 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1178 / 2008 of 28 November 2008 (EC Implementing Directive).
In order to improve readability and clarity, the EC Recovery Directive codified Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC of 15 March 197616, the provisions of which had been substantially amended several times.
Among other things, the recovery of VAT and taxes on income and assets, including the associated interest, fees and deferred charges, is regulated.
The EC Recovery Directive was transposed into German law by the Recovery Act (EC) 17 of 3 May 2003.
The enforcement procedure in Germany is regulated in the Tax Code (AO).
§ 117 (2) AO stipulates that the financial authorities may provide inter-governmental legal and administrative assistance by virtue of international treaties and applicable European Communities legal standards in national law, as well as by virtue of the EC Official Assistance Act.
Part Six of the AO (§ 249-346) contains the legal provisions for the enforcement procedure.
In particular, the enforcement and enforcement instructions govern the management of the financial authorities.
The Federal Ministry of Finance agreed with the representatives of the Supreme Financial Authorities of the Länder on the principles of mutual assistance in tax matters and transferred its own competence in this area to the Federal Central Tax Office 18.
General conditions for the admissibility of a request for recovery aid are:
• The legal requirements must be fulfilled (§ 251, 254 AO).
• All recovery funds available domestically have been exhausted.
• Claims for which assistance is requested are incontestable.
• The period between the issue of the enforcement title or the date on which the claim or title became undisputable and the date on which the request was made may not exceed five years.
• The claim must amount to at least 1 500 euros.
Procedures for outgoing requests to other EU member states The German requests for the recovery of residual taxes are forwarded by the enforcement authorities of the FÄ via the competent central authority and the Federal Central Office of Taxation of the foreign authority concerned, e.g.
The details are set out in the leaflet on intergovernmental assistance in tax collection (collection) of 19 January 200419.
This leaflet is currently being revised by a federal-state working group and adapted to the new recovery directive.
The request, together with the annexes, will be forwarded electronically by the FA to the Central Authority.
The latter checks whether it is correct in terms of content and form.
If not, the request will be returned to the FA concerned.
Otherwise it will be sent to the Federal Central Office of Taxation.
The Federal Central Office of Taxation will then take over the necessary communication with the foreign authority concerned.
Procedure for incoming requests from other EU Member States
Requests for collection from other Member States will be registered in the Federal Central Office of Taxation, which will send a confirmation of receipt within ten days.
It will also check whether the formal conditions have been met.
As a matter of principle, the Federal Central Office of Taxation will forward these requests to the Central Financial Authority, which will forward them to the relevant FA and will supervise the implementation.
The Federal Central Office of Taxation also sends interim or final reports.
If the processing of a request lasts longer than six months, it reminds the budgetary authority of the obligation to submit an interim report pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Directive 2002 / 94 / EC.
After examining the formal and factual conditions for the admissibility of the request, the enforcement bodies announce relevant measures.
All sums included must be transferred to the bank account indicated in the request within one month of receipt.
Statistical data
Information on mutual recovery aid between Germany and the CZ for the years 2006 to 2008 (as of 31 December 2008).
4.4.3 Examination of selected recovery cases
A total of 21 inter-state recovery requests between the CZ and Germany have been selected for the examination. Below are ten cases in which inter alia:
The following was found:
1 overall pick in the draft.
On 20 October 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German request for the recovery of USt debts of a Czech taxpayer from 2004 and 2005 totalling EUR 3 883 (109 820 CZK).
As recently as 26 February 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the competent FA.
In order to secure the claim to be paid, the Czech FA charged a property belonging to the taxable person with a right of deposit.
As the loaded property was not sufficient to settle the entire tax debt, an instalment payment agreement of at least CZK 2 000 per month was made with the debtor.
On 31 August 2009 an interim report was sent to the German FA. According to this, the taxpayer had in the meantime settled tax debts amounting to 49 600 CZK (as of 25 August 2009).
The amount was transferred to Germany. Shortly thereafter, on 28 August 2009, another 3 000 CZK were transferred.
2.
On 7 January 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for collection of tax debts (US, income tax) and interest and fees of a Czech taxpayer totalling EUR 180 869 (= 4 434 915 CZK).
As recently as 27 November 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the competent FA.
After examining bank balances, securities, real estate, motor vehicles and other movable assets, the FA found that the debtor did not have a pledge of assets.
Investigations at the scene also revealed that the debtor had been absent from his permanent residence for almost a year.
His whereabouts in the CZ were unknown.
This communication was received by the Czech Ministry of Finance on 6 April 2009 and forwarded to the German Treasury on 16 April 2009.
3.
On 21 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German request for the recovery of USt together with interest and fees amounting to a total of EUR 3 139 (= 84 846 CZK).
As recently as 6 August 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the competent FA. On 18 February 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance from Germany was informed that the Czech tax debtor had now paid the debt.
On 9 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance informed the Czech FA that the case had been closed because the Czech tax debtor had paid his debt in full in Germany.
However, the debt was also settled in the CZ in the context of the recovery procedure and the corresponding amount was transferred to Germany on 27 October 2008.
Due to the long time it took the Czech Ministry of Finance to pass on the information to the FA, the tax liability was paid twice - by the taxpayer himself in Germany and by means of collection by the competent Czech FA.
In cooperation with the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors), it was established that the attached amount would be offset against the tax liability arising from another procedure, amounting to EUR 6 649, which should be transferred to the CZ in September 2008.
In the documents of the Czech Ministry of Finance, there was only one request for recovery for the company concerned in the amount of EUR 3 139. The request for recovery in the amount of EUR 6 649 was not found there.
4.
On 15 September 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German request for collection of income tax, VAT, interest and fees totalling EUR 39 957 = 956 654 CZK.
It was not until 19 December 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the competent FA.
On June 1, 2009, the recovery procedure was initiated and a decision was taken on the seizure of the Czech bank balance and the debtor's salary (CZK 7 000).
During the negotiations with the FA, the debtor disagreed with the amount of the tax liability and the amount was disputed.
According to the Czech FA, in the past the debtor had been willing to pay EUR 250 per month, but the competent German FA disagreed.
The taxpayer agreed to discuss his matter with the German FA in order to agree on a different amount.
The recovery procedure was not completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.
5.
On 19 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German request for collection for income tax of the year 2005 and USt for the years 2003 to 2007, together with interest and fees totalling EUR 113 444 = 3 116 304 CZK.
As recently as 14 November 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the FA Prague 1, which is not authorised to deal with tax cases of taxable persons resident in the CZ; on the basis of the available address, a local competent FA could not be determined.
During its investigation on 19 September 2008, the FA received information and documents indicating that the debtor's income amounted to EUR 4 704. However, it was unable to issue an enforcement order because the request for recovery had been received after that date.
On 26 January 2009, the Czech FA initiated the recovery procedure and issued an enforcement order for the seizure of the debtor's assets from credit institutions.
The recovery procedure was not completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.
6.
On 3 October 2006, the competent Czech FA requested inter-governmental assistance in the recovery of a USt debt together with the costs of the proceedings totalling 146 223 742 CZK.
As recently as 13 May 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the German tax administration.
On 8 September 2008, the competent German FA, via the Bundesbank, transferred to the Czech authorities the amount of EUR 17 700 = 439 226 CZK added to the account attachment.
A conversion error was discovered when checking the amounts included.
The amount to be paid at 146 223 742 CZK was converted at the exchange rate of EUR 1 = 25,065 CZK, but a comma error resulted in an amount of EUR 583 378.
The correct amount to be paid amounted to EUR 5 833 782.
As a result, a recovery request for EUR 5 250 404 was submitted which was too low.
7.
On 1 March 2007, the competent Czech FA requested the recovery of a USt debt together with interest and fees of a Czech taxable person amounting to a total of 1 970 632 CZK = 79 847 Euro.
It was not until 10 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the German tax administration.
The German FA requested the debtor to pay the arrears on 4 February 2009.
Taking into account the significant reduction in the Company's revenues in the second half of 2008 and in particular in the first half of 2009 and the corresponding liquidity situation, the following payments were made to settle the overdue tax liability. On 8 April 2009 - 4 600 euros, on 6 May 2009 -3 000 euros and on 16 June 2009 - 2 500 euros.
These payments were transferred to the account of the competent FA in the Czech Republic.
On 23 June 2009, a further payment of EUR 2,500 was agreed between the debtor and the FA until 30 June 2009.
8.
On 22 May 2008, the competent Czech FA requested the recovery of tax debts totalling EUR 398 653 = 9 832 779 CZK, which included, inter alia, land acquisition tax.
As recently as 2 October 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the German tax administration.
The request was returned in a letter from the German Treasury to the Czech Ministry of Finance dated 3 April 2009.
The German tax administration justified this on the grounds that the basic advertising tax was not a tax within the meaning of Article 2 (e), (f), (g) and (h) of Directive 2008 / 55 / EC.
In addition, Article 2 (g) relates to liabilities arising from taxes on income and assets.
Article 3 of Directive 2008 / 55 / EC applies accordingly to taxes on income and property not specified in Articles 1, 3 and 4 of Directive 77 / 799 / EEC.
The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed that a new recovery request should be sent to the German tax administration, which should no longer include the basic value added tax arrears of 61 759 CZK, but the arrears in US, corporate and income taxes.
The Czech Ministry of Finance received a new request from the competent FA for the recovery of tax debts of the same taxable person amounting to 7 079 735 CZK.
9.
On 6 February 2006, the competent Czech FA sent the Czech Ministry of Finance a request for recovery for income tax and VAT totalling EUR 3 445 782 CZK = 123 328.
The USt debt amounted to 1 133 967 CZK.
On 18 April 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the German tax administration.
and only on 11 November 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded to the Czech FA the reply of the German tax administration dated 9 July 2007,
On 11 June 2007, the German FA issued an enforcement order for the seizure of the bank account. The bank stated that it was not in a business relationship with the named taxable person.
Thus the request for the German financial administration was deemed to have been completed.
10, according to the Associated Press.
On 26 September 2005, the competent Czech FA sent to the Czech Ministry of Finance a request for the recovery of USt debts totalling 1 296 845 CZK = 43 591 Euro.
The relevant Financial Directorate submitted the request to the Ministry of Finance on 10 October 2005.
The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request to the German Treasury on 15 December 2005.
Before sending the request, the Czech FA carried out the tax requirement by seizing the bank accounts and salary collection as well as by loading a property.
An information request was sent to the German tax administration on 16 March 2005, prior to the request for registration.
According to a letter of reply sent to the Czech FA on 16 September 2005, the Czech taxpayer was domiciled in Germany and had income from non-independent activities amounting to EUR 8 437. On 20 April 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a reply to the request for collection and forwarded it to the competent Czech FA on 12 February 2008.
According to this principle, the tax liability in Germany is indefensible due to the insolvency of the debtor.
No assets have been identified and income from non-self-employed work is already the subject of other enforcement measures.
The German tax administration considered the request to be completed.
4.4.4 Comparison and evaluation
In the case of recovery, all EU Member States are subject to the requirements of EU law for inter-governmental assistance.
The procedures for dealing with requests are therefore similar in the CZ and Germany.
The Bundesrechungshof and NKÚ have compared the statistics transmitted by the two Member States to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.
There were discrepancies.
In its 2006 report, the European Commission recommended that Member States prepare their statistics with greater care.
In 200921, the Commission concluded that despite the increase in the number of requests for assistance, the discrepancies in the statistics have decreased.
Both Court of Auditors consider that a renewed debate at EU level on the statistics is useful in order to avoid the remaining discrepancies in the future.
If this does not happen, the statistics are conditional and cannot be used for comparisons.
Moreover, the Court of Auditors considers that the statistics should show both the annual number of requests and the type of claims (e.g. VAT, income tax) and the amount of sums contributed per Member State.
By analysing more closely the statistics provided by Member States, the Commission could help Member States to assess their measures to combat USt fraud.
Since the recovery rate can be calculated per Member State, the Court of Auditors argues that Member States with a low recovery rate should at least aim for the average recovery rate within the EU.
At the request of a Member State, the Commission could play an active role in this.
The foreign recovery requests received by the Ministry of Finance (CZ) were forwarded to the competent FÄ in particular in 2006 and 2007, which were delayed.
The same applies to the requests for recovery made by the Czech FÄ.
The investigation showed that the Czech Ministry of Finance infringed Law No 191 / 2004 on inter-governmental recovery assistance by failing to inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the progress of the recovery measures within the six-month period following receipt of the request.
4.5 VAT audit of large companies
4.5.1 VAT audit of large enterprises in the Czech Republic
More broadly, the report said: "We have seen a rise in the number of people who have been diagnosed with the condition, and a rise in the number of people who have been diagnosed with it.
The tax procedure for large companies is subject to the same rules as those for other taxable persons.
The audit of large enterprises is regulated by Czech Law No. 337 / 1992, the "Tax and Fee Management Act."
The Czech Ministry of Finance defines large enterprises as natural persons who have set up a business or legal persons who have been established to carry out a business and whose net turnover for the relevant tax period amounts to at least CZK 2 billion, according to income or corporate tax returns.
The taxable person is classified as a large company on the basis of the level of turnover according to the income or corporate tax return in the respective tax period; for the first time in 2003.
A natural or legal entity is no longer run as a large-scale operation for the purposes of turnover taxation if its net turnover in the taxing period is less than CZK 2 billion for three consecutive investment periods. The period begins at the end of the taxing period for which the requirements were met for the first time in accordance with the tax return.
A taxable person can only be removed from the list of large companies if at least one type of tax has been assessed beforehand for a period of time.
By the end of 2009, all large farms were audited at least every five years.
Since 2010, taxable persons have to be assessed in writing at least every two years. The subsequent control measures are intended to eliminate the tax risks and their negative impact on the proper determination and collection of taxes.
The audits by the FÄ are to focus on at least one type of tax; they usually cover several tax periods.
The large taxable enterprises were audited by the special audit bodies or audit services of the competent FÄ set up at a total of 13 FÄ.
A special auditing body carried out audits in its local area of responsibility in accordance with the instructions of the Head of the Finance Directorate.
She also tested positive for cocaine.
Taxpayers with unusual and special business activities and
those whose examination required a high degree of expertise and time.
Taxpayers with complex location distribution and organisational structure,
Taxpayers suspected of large-scale tax evasion
as well as taxable persons belonging to chains and networks suspected of large-scale tax evasion and unjustified deduction.
Information on the number of audits carried out by the special audit bodies of FÄ and the tax results of these audits are shown in Table No. 3.
The Czech Ministry of Finance has submitted a proposal for the amendment of Law No. 531 / 1990 for the regional financial authorities. In particular, it proposes the establishment of a special financial office with nationwide jurisdiction for selected taxable persons (legal entities established for the purpose of economic activity with a turnover of at least CZK 2 billion).
4.5.2 Examination of VAT at large enterprises in Germany
More broadly, the report said: "We have seen a rise in the number of people who have been diagnosed with the condition, and a rise in the number of people who have been diagnosed with it.
The USt audit of large companies is not particularly regulated in Germany. For operating audits, the general regulations • of the tax regulations (AO), • of the financial management law (FVG) and • of the operating audit regulations (BpO) apply.
There are also work aids.
House of Commons tax bill
The provisions of § § 193 to 203 AO "Section 4 - External Examination" contain in particular rules for the admissibility of an external examination and its material scope, distribution of responsibilities, form and content of the examination announcement, principles for the examination, obligations for the taxpayer to contribute and requirements for final interviews and for the transmission of the examination report.
External tests are carried out by the competent FÄ (§ 195 AO).
In accordance with § 5 paragraph 1 No. 1 in conjunction with § 19, the Federal Central Office of Taxation is responsible for participating in external audits of the FÄ.
The nature and extent of this participation will be agreed between the authorities involved.
In addition, the Federal Central Office of Taxation may require that certain establishments that it renames may be audited at a certain time.
In this case, it may lay down rules for external auditing of these taxable persons.
According to Article 108 paragraph 7 of the Basic Law, the Rules of Audit (BpO 2000) have been adopted with the consent of the Federal Council.
It applies to external audits of the national tax authorities and the Federal Central Office of Taxation.
According to § 3 BpO, companies are regularly classified into size classes.
Large enterprises are to be subjected to a connection test (point 4.2 BpO).
Pursuant to Section 33.1 BpO, each competent financial authority shall maintain a group directory within the meaning of the provision.
Work aids for the administration
In addition, the following working aids have been issued for the administration:
• "Uniform Manual for the USt Special Examination";
• VAT countries online - USLO (= dialogue system in the intra-Community USt control procedure) with instructions on how to use the data contained in the MIAS on intra-Community business relations;
• Working aids for difficult and special situations.
• Central database for the storage and evaluation of USt fraud cases and the development of risk profiles -ZAUBER;
Taxpayers are grouped into size categories based on criteria such as turnover and profit, with thresholds varying according to each branch of the business.
The figures are published by the Federal Ministry of Finance.
Values are reviewed every three years and fixed for the following three years.
The number of companies - not only large companies - is regularly recorded (last deadline: 1 January 2010).
In general, large enterprises must be fully audited.
The examinations are announced and generally cover the USt,
d. h., the audit covers all relevant taxes, i.e. income or corporate tax as well as commercial and USt.
The sales tax can be audited either by auditors or by special USt auditors.
The practice varies and depends on the administrative structure of each country.
The number of tax periods covered by an audit usually varies between three and five years.
BpO 2000 is expected to last three years.
All taxes to which a company has been estimated are subject to the audit.
4.5.3 Management of the VAT audit at large companies
In accordance with the agreement, both Court of Auditors did not examine individual cases. They examined the way in which the financial administrations conduct the audit of large enterprises.
By means of a questionnaire, they collected information from the financial administrations which is essential for the audit of large enterprises.
• What statistical records and evaluations for the audit of large enterprises are available to the management of the tax administration?
In particular:
• Are there any statistics or records on the extent to which there is a distinction between USt fraud control and general USt audit?
CZ: No, the current version of the ATIS system does not allow such a distinction.
Germany: The tax administration does not distinguish between audits to combat USt fraud and general USt audits.
• Are there any statistics or records of the proximity of the tests?
CZ: Information on the timeliness of audits of intra-Community acquisitions of selected USt pledgers will be recorded in the ATIS system;
The same applies to information on the beginning and end of the examination of the FA.
Germany: No, the statistics for auditors compiled at the federal level contain only information about the so-called average last audit period (year).
This figure does not give an overview of the audit periods selected for individual companies.
Special USt auditors focus on the last USt investment periods and are also authorised to audit large companies.
The federal statistics for USt special examiners do not contain information on the size class of the tested plant.
• Are there statistics or records about the type of multiple result; e.g.
real multiple result (e.g. B. Application of a reduced rate instead of the general USt rate)
i. unreal additional result (e.g. B. Relocation / postponement of a subject matter which is not objectionable under sales tax law to another taxing period)
iii. Cash Effectiveness (payment of the fixed additional result)
According to CZ:
The Czech tax administration monitors the number of tax audits carried out, the amount of the additional tax result broken down by type of tax, the number of taxable persons audited and the number of audited tax periods.
Other tax procedures (on-the-spot investigations, written warnings) will be monitored in the same way.
Regardless of this, the amount of after-payments and the receipt of payments are recorded.
Statistics on tax debts are broken down by type of tax, but there is no distinction between tax debts resulting from a tax return and those resulting from FA audit activities.
Germany: No, the statistics for auditors and special USt auditors, which are compiled at the federal level, do not differ according to the above criteria.
The majority of financial authorities which carried out local surveys did not differentiate in this respect either.
• Are inconclusive fields of examination recorded?
CZ: Yes, the FA can select examination cases on the basis of criteria linked to selected indicators stored in the ATIS system.
Germany: There are no federal regulations.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and USt special examiners do not provide such information.
However, the federal and state finance ministries have agreed on a common approach.
According to this, auditors and tax investigators of the countries have to enter into ZAUBER the additional tax result achieved by them if a certain threshold is exceeded.
In this case, additional information must be provided, e.g. about the origin of the additional USt result obtained.
• Which are the most common findings?
According to CZ:
- large taxable enterprises have unjustly claimed a deduction for the provision of supplies and services;
• which were not used for an entrepreneurial activity in accordance with § 72 (1) CZ UStG;
• used for representation expenses in accordance with § 75 (3) CZ UStG;
• due to invoices which do not comply with the requirements of § 73 (1) CZ UStG
- Taxable large enterprises have omitted the registration of USt to be paid as provided in § 21 (1) CZ UStG.
Germany: There are no federal regulations.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and USt special examiners do not provide such information.
Findings on the impact of large-scale audits are not recorded separately by the countries.
However, the Federal Central Office of Taxation can evaluate the ZAUBER database into which the auditors and tax investigators of the countries have to enter the additional tax result achieved by them if a certain threshold is exceeded.
• Does the financial administration analyse fields of audit that yield results and draw conclusions for strategic management?
CZ: Yes, e.g. B. Nationwide audits are carried out with regard to risky goods and industries.
Germany: There are no federal regulations.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and USt special examiners do not provide information on particularly "productive" audit fields.
There were different views on the analysis of such information, the use of it and the way in which it was used further.
Some superfinance directorates provide such information to the FÄ, but the FÄ s are free to use it or not.
4.5.4 Comparison and evaluation
As a result, large amounts of information are processed automatically in the CZ. Data from USt tests, as well as key figures from balance sheets, profit and loss accounts are processed in the system, among other things.
The CZ is able to control the selection of high-risk cases using a wide range of information.
The same applies to the evaluation and management of USt tests in general.
The CZ is planning to set up a special financial office for large enterprises in 2012.
In Germany, the financial administration does not collect comparable amounts of data.
It is therefore more difficult to carry out these tasks in the same way.
More emphasis is placed on the selection of individual cases.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
On the basis of the information in USt pre-registrations or USt declarations and test notes, qualified examiners select the cases to be examined and ensure the correct taxation.
Appropriate management processes and risk management systems must be put in place to reduce loss of revenue at USt and, at the same time, to increase the risk of detection for unreliable entrepreneurs.

5 conclusions.
Cooperation between the two Court of Auditors has proven its worth.
In this way, necessary knowledge of the systems used in both countries could be obtained: • Internal Revenue, • Risk Management at the USt in particular with regard to the selection of risky transactions, • Recovery of USt receivables and • USt audit of large enterprises.
The audit revealed differences in strategies for detecting USt fraud and the systems described above.
These findings can be used to improve existing procedures.
They can also be used to initiate a discussion among interested parties about the audit approaches and strategies that can be used to combat fraud, such as the relationship between Member States and the EU Commission.
The experience and knowledge gained should encourage the continued joint examination of the administration of the USt.

Report on the results of the parallel audit of the administration of turnover tax in the Czech Republic and Germany
The foreword:
The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, stresses that the Court of Auditors has the power to audit all public finances.
The declaration calls for the Court of Auditors to have the power to examine tax collection as broadly as possible.
The organisation of the European Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxation to be an important component of public revenue.
The main thematic focus of the 6th EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the audit of public revenues by the Court of Auditors.
One of the most important steps towards optimising the audit work of an Court of Auditors is the development of a specific strategy for auditing public revenues.
This is particularly true of taxes, the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of default.
As national economies become increasingly interconnected and interdependent, a situation may arise in which the national auditors can only carry out their audit work in cooperation with the auditors of other countries.
Consider, for example, the audit of internationally organised fraud, which can lead to significant loss of revenue in many states.
Cooperation between the authorities is needed in the fight against such crimes.
Court of Auditors auditing in this area must be prepared to cooperate closely with each other.
The idea for an audit of the VAT and the MIAS system arose at the 6th EUROSAI Congress in Bonn. This audit was carried out in cooperation between the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Audit Court.
In the course of thorough preparation, the participating Court of Auditors first had to familiarize themselves with the legal framework and procedures for VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.
On the basis of the evaluation of the available information, we made the selection of the examination objects for the examination planning.
Achieving consistent and effective management of VAT is a long-standing problem and individual Member States (in particular the EC Member States) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify the collection of VAT and increase transparency in this area.
We are convinced that the results of our audit will not only contribute to improving the work of the financial administration, but may also form the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international information exchange.
Report on the results of the parallel audit of the administration of turnover tax in the Czech Republic and Germany
An introduction to the game
File number: CZ) 06 / 27 (DE) VIII 2 - 2005 - 1215
Subject of examination:
(CZ) Management of VAT following the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union
(DE) Examination of administrative cooperation in the field of VAT in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and 1925 / 2004
Commission's audit target:
(CZ) The purpose of the audit in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedures applied by the tax administration in the field of turnover tax following the integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter referred to as the "EC") with the free movement of goods and services, as well as the use of MIAS1, in particular the control of the use of the VAT exemption for intra-Community supplies.
(DE) The aim of the audit was to examine the system of intra-Community VAT control with a focus on administrative assistance in the field of VAT in accordance with the above-mentioned regulations.
As a result of the audit, weaknesses should be identified and recommendations should be made to remedy them.
Based on an agreement concluded on 8 June 2006, the audits were carried out jointly by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic ("NKÚ") and the Federal Court of Justice ("BRH") of the Federal Republic of Germany.
The main areas of cooperation were the verification of selected business transactions between entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the exploitation of information obtained through international administrative assistance between financial administrations and the comparison of VAT management systems in the two countries.
A joint final report on the results of the audits has been prepared in accordance with European Guideline No 31 for the implementation of the INTOSAI audit standards.
The period examined covered the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005.
Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel examination
The parallel audit of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two Court of Auditors.
In addition to the focus on the exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and 1925 / 2004 of the Commission, other closely related aspects were examined, such as the registration of tax liabilities, tax returns and summary notices.
The examination also covered the legal situation of cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach and the comparison of statistical data.
When comparing the systems of VAT administrations in the two countries, differences were found in the following areas:
1) Registration for purposes of VAT.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the level of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among others, the main criterion for registration is the violation of the VAT threshold laid down in the VAT Act.
In the Czech Republic, tax fleets receive only a single tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, the tax filer receives a tax number valid only for domestic sales for purposes of VAT.
If the German taxpayer wants to make intra-Community transactions, he must apply for a special identification number, the so-called USt-IdNr.
As problems arise from the different registration procedures, the rules should be harmonised within the EC (see 4.1).
2) Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach.
In the Czech Republic, cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach is exempt from VAT, but is entitled to deduction of VAT.
In Germany, as far as the route passes through Germany, the transport service is subject to turnover tax.
Efforts should be made at EC level to harmonise the situation in accordance with Article 393 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of turnover tax (see 4.2).
3) Tax returns.
Whereas in the Czech Republic the tax authorities are only required to file VAT returns for tax periods of less than one year (month or quarter), tax authorities in Germany (monthly or quarterly)
Pre-registrations of VAT and after the end of the calendar year a declaration of annual sales tax.
In contrast to the Czech Republic, tax preparers in Germany must submit VAT pre-registration electronically.
The introduction of the VAT electronic levy in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of the Czech tax administration (see 4.3).
4) Summarized messages.
While tax preparers in the Czech Republic are required to file their Summary Notices with the Internal Revenue Service (FÄ), German tax preparers are required to file the Summary Notices with the CLO2.
Accordingly, the information contained in the Summary Notices will be available to the FÄ in the Czech Republic as soon as they are filed.
The data from the Summary Reports are only available to German FÄ only after their processing by the CLO.
Updated information on intra-Community transactions is needed to combat VAT fraud as soon as possible.
The monthly submission of Summary Notices would shorten the period between the time of the turnover and the update of the MIAS data.
This would allow for a timely assessment of taxation in the acquirer's Member State (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduce the same time limits.
5) International exchange of information in the field of VAT.
In the event of a request for information, the Czech CLO will monitor compliance with the three-month period.
The German CLO does not monitor processing times.
As a result, the German tax administration has dealt with a significantly lower percentage of requests for information within the prescribed time limit.
Because of these problems, the BRH has recommended to the German CLO a permanent monitoring of the time limits (see 4.6).
6) Risk management.
Each of the two Member States is in the process of developing its own risk management system (RMS) with appropriate strengths and weaknesses.
The NKÚ and the BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by a Member State alone.
Successful RMS criteria, elements or approaches must be exchanged and implemented in all EC Member States. Otherwise, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5).
In the context of cooperation, the two Court of Auditors examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions carried out between Czech and German tax entities.
Of these, 31 cases were jointly reviewed using CLO's legal options where there were doubts about correct taxation or suspected VAT fraud.
The Court of Auditors found that:
In some cases, the FÄ used the information obtained in the international exchange of information and re-established the VAT liability of the tax subject.
In these cases, the tax authorities had either unlawfully taken advantage of the VAT exemption or failed to declare the purchase of goods in their VAT return.
In some cases, the FÄ could not use the information obtained in the exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used due to differences in legislation between the two Member States.
In some cases, the tax administration of another Member State refused to provide the requested information.
A number of cases have been uncovered in which tax authorities have incorrectly reported turnover in their summary reports.
As a result, the data in the MIAS were correspondingly incorrect, so that the experts (the FÄ) had to determine in these cases (see 6).
The review process
Examination procedures in the CR
The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by Department II - "State Budget Revenue" and the Territorial Examination Departments of Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.
Verified bodies were: Ministry of Finance and 10 FÄ Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadaň, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Třinec.
The College of NKÚ approved the findings of the audit on 23 April 2007.
Testing procedures in Germany
The audit was carried out between July 2006 and February 2007 by the examination area Traffic Taxes and employees of the assigned PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt / Main and Munich.
It was part of the work plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006.
After a test phase, the actual testing began in the fourth quarter of 2006.
According to the cases selected by the BRH and later by the NKÚ, the BRH had to announce the audit with several federal states.
Apart from interviews in the BMF and the CLO, the examination was carried out in the following federal states:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
Tax files from the following cases were included in the audit:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, Munich Corporations, Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-North and Hamburg for large companies, Hannover-North, Winsen-Luhe, Bonn-Innenstadt, Cologne-Mitte, Cologne-Porz, Cologne-Süd, Sankt Augustin, Pirmasens, Bautzen, Chemnitz-Süd, Dresden II, Freiberg, Leipzig and Zopschau.
Talks were also held with the FÄ Augsburg-Stadt, Aurich, Düsseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.
The results were communicated to the BMF in May 2007.
Cooperation between the two Court of Auditors
In the run-up to the parallel audit, several meetings of representatives of both Court of Auditors took place.
The participants in these meetings familiarized themselves with the organization of the tax administration, the legislation on the sales tax and the system of the sales tax administration in the other country.
The subject of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006.
The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.
At this meeting, a timetable for the further procedure was drawn up and the following examination topics were identified for the parallel tests: 1.
Registration of tax fugitives.
2.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach - legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.
3. International exchange of information, in particular the approach of financial officials to the processing of requests for information and the verification of selected problem cases mentioned in the requests for information, as well as spontaneous exchanges between the Czech Republic and Germany.
4. Tax returns.
5.
Summarized messages.
6.
Statistical information on deliveries and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany.
7. Risk management in the sales tax area.
At a meeting in December 2006 to coordinate the further examination of the NKÚ and the BRH, both sides familiarized themselves with the examination procedure in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of the parallel tests already achieved.

An entrepreneur with legal domicile, registered office or establishment in the Czech Republic, whose turnover in the last 12 consecutive calendar months exceeds the amount of CZK 1,000,000, shall be liable for payment on the first day of the third month after the month in which he has exceeded the threshold (§ 94 (1) of the Law Nr. 235 / 2004 Coll., concerning the VAT; hereinafter "Law Nr. 235 / 2004").
The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he has exceeded the registration threshold.
Current legislation does not allow for the retroactive registration of a taxable person who has exceeded the application deadline for registration.
An entrepreneur with legal domicile, registered office or establishment in the Czech Republic who provides services subject to turnover tax or services exempt from VAT with the right to deduct VAT must also be registered for VAT if his turnover does not exceed CZK 1 million, but he fulfils other conditions set out in Law No. 235 / 2004.
An entrepreneur with legal domicile, registered office or establishment in the Czech Republic who does not fulfil any of the conditions set out in the law may voluntarily apply for VAT registration.
The registration procedure under Law No 337 / 1992 commences with the receipt of the registration application by the local tax officer.
Those who wish to register voluntarily for VAT must specify in their application the date on which they apply for registration as a VAT subject.
The financial officer has to check the information provided by the entrepreneur, i.e. the completed application for registration with all investments.
If he has doubts about the information contained therein, he shall ask the applicant to explain, supplement or substantiate the information provided.
Once the financial officer has verified that the trader meets the requirements for registration, he must issue a written communication on the registration and allocation of a tax number.
In the communication, the tax officer is required to indicate the date of entry into force of the VAT registration and the period of disposition for the VAT.
The investment period is the calendar quarter; unless the entrepreneur's turnover for the previous calendar year has reached the amount of at least CZK 10,000,000.
If this is the case, the disposition period is the calendar month.
An entrepreneur whose turnover in the preceding calendar year has reached at least CZK 2,000,000 is entitled to choose the calendar month as the fixed period and has to inform the financial officer of this change.
The issue of a tax number in the registration decision always has a constitutive character.
The taxable person has to give the tax number in every communication (including payments) with the tax officer, and also in cases where a special law requires this (e.g. Law Nr. 235 / 2004 concerning the preparation of tax documents) 3.
The tax number contains the encoding "CZ" and a basic component in the form of a general identification mark.
In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or another general identification mark, insofar as this is determined by a special law. In the case of legal persons, the general identification mark is the company identification number (in accordance with the provisions of § 33 (12) of Law No. 337 / 1992).
If the entrepreneur has not fulfilled his obligations despite the corresponding request by the financial officer, the local responsible financial officer shall register him as such.
A communication will also be issued, which will be sent to the taxman.
In the Czech Republic, every entrepreneur authorised to do business will receive a tax number at the time of his first registration for any type of tax.
This also applies to the registration as a VAT payer.
According to law No. 235 / 2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, in the event of non-compliance with the obligation to register the VAT, the tax officer may require that the taxable person should have registered up to 10% of the proceeds from the taxable turnover that the person has unlawfully made without taxation for the period from the date on which the entrepreneur should have been registered as a taxable person, up to the date on which the registration as a taxable person was made by order of the tax officer (§ 98 (1) of the law Nr / 235).
The payment of this amount shall be deemed to be a tax payment within the meaning of § 98 (3) of Law Nr. 235 / 2004, i.e. it is not a fine or penalty.
If the legal requirements exist, the registration of a VAT subject can be deleted for two reasons:
1) There's no getting away from the fact that there's a lot of people out there who don't know what's going on.
Deletion of registration at the request of the taxable person, i.e. mainly for the reason that the turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (§ 106 (1) of Law No. 235 / 2004).
A tax preparer may request the deletion of his registration at the earliest one year after the date of entry into force mentioned in the registration notice.
2) Deletion of the registration of official acts (§ 106 (7) of Law Nr. 235 / 2004) if: a) the taxable person has not performed any service in the period of 12 consecutive months and has not informed the tax official of the reasons for it; b) the taxable person has not fulfilled his obligations in accordance with Law Nr. 235 / 2004; c) the previous tax person no longer fulfils the requirements for the tax liaison.
B) Tax subject without legal domicile, registered office or business premises in the Czech Republic A person who is registered for tax purposes in another Member State and does not have a legal domicile, registered office or place of business in the Czech Republic, or a tax resident foreigner who performs services in the Czech Republic and has to file a tax return and pay taxes ("non-resident entrepreneur") in accordance with § 108 of Law Nr. 235 / 2004 for these services or deliveries shall be liable to pay tax on the provision of the services in question.
He must submit an application for registration with the FA Prague 1 at the latest on the day of the delivery in question.
In this application, he is obliged to indicate all the USt-IdNr. assigned to him in other Member States or third countries.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration later than the date of the first tax-efficient provision of services in the Czech Republic, the FA Prague 1 has to register him retroactively as he became subject to turnover tax on the date of the first tax-efficient provision of services in the Czech Republic, in accordance with Law No. 235 / 2004.
In the event of a retroactive registration, FA Prague 1 shall require a document (invoices or written explanations) from the contractors concerned to provide proof of performance.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration in the Czech Republic before performing a service for the first time, FA Prague 1 shall require the submission of the contractual documents justifying the performance.
As of 31 December 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with the FA Prague 1, of which 124 were from Germany. As of 31 December 2005, a total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered, of which 233 were from Germany.
According to the provisions of § 106 (9) of Law Nr. 235 / 2004, the tax officer is authorized to delete the registration of a non-resident entrepreneur as of 31 January of the following calendar year if he does not accept the obligation to file tax declarations or tax returns and to pay taxes.
During the examination of the NKÚ, it turned out that in the case of the filing of a tax return by post with dispatch abroad on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the mandatory deadline for filing a tax return, this declaration had not yet been received by the FA until 31 January.
In cases where these facts, which are relevant to the possibility of deletion of registration, become known to the FA later than 31 January, it is no longer possible to cancel the registration of the non-resident entrepreneur for VAT in the Czech Republic in the calendar year in question.
Registration of tax preparers in Germany
Pursuant to the provisions of the Ordinance on Taxation (§ § 137, 138 AO), any business operation must be notified to the municipality and / or the competent tax office.
This notification must be made no later than one month after the start of business.
The municipality will forward the application to the tax authorities.
If the competent tax office determines that a business activity has commenced but has not been notified, it may also register the tax lien retroactively.
Regardless of whether they are resident or not, tax evaders in Germany are required to register for VAT on Zwekke if they meet the requirements of § 2 of the German VAT Act (UStG).
This does not depend on the level of turnover achieved.
There is no voluntary registration in Germany.
Special FÄ are responsible for entrepreneurs residing abroad.
For example, FA ChemnitzSüd is responsible for those entrepreneurs who have their registered office in the Czech Republic.
As of 30 April 2004, 295 Czech entrepreneurs had been registered with this company; as of 1 March 2006, 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs had been registered there.
According to the findings of the BRH, these special jurisdictions frequently refused to register so-called bogus self-employed persons residing in the new or Central and Eastern European Member States of the EC.
Since the free movement of workers is still restricted after the accession of these ten countries to the Community, these self-employed people tried to circumvent these restrictions by setting up their own businesses.
These self-employed persons do not fulfil the conditions laid down in § 2 UStG for recognition as entrepreneurs, as they are usually dependent on a single client who determines their working time and the way in which they carry out their work.
In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must complete a questionnaire drawn up by the competent FA and provide information on the company and the activities carried out.
The questionnaire is a mandatory form for all German universities.
It is processed either in special organizational units within the FÄ or in the organizational units generally responsible for the tax planning.
With the help of this preprint, a risk assessment is carried out for the individual tax subject before the allocation of a tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions is based on certain requirements:
The first three digits are the identification number for the competent FA, the following three (or four) digits indicate which department is responsible within the FA, the following five (or four) digits are the identification feature for the controller, the last digit is always a control digit.
If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-Community trade, in order to be able to make tax-free intra-Community deliveries, he needs a USt-IdNr.
This is assigned by the CLO on request, if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany for sales tax purposes.
The USt-IdNr. is automatically assigned by the CLO if the taxable person declares intra-Community deliveries in his or her VAT declarations or in his or her annual declaration of VAT.
The USt-IdNr. is composed of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.
The registration of an entrepreneur can be deleted: 1. On request (e.g. when he ceases to do business), but only after the completion of all tax transactions (predisposition of all financial years) or 2. If the tax administration determines that he is no longer running a business.
As a rule, the validity of the USt-IdNr. depends on the validity of the VAT number.
In such cases, the FÄ must inform the CLO of the deletion of the VAT number so that the validity of the VAT ID can be terminated at that time.
According to the German Sales Tax Act (§ 19 (1) UStG), domestic tax fleets do not have to pay VAT in the following cases: 1. the turnover of the previous calendar year plus the resulting value added tax has not exceeded the amount of €17,500 and 2. is unlikely to exceed the amount of €50,000 in the following year.
The so-called small entrepreneurs are not entitled to charge VAT to other entrepreneurs, nor to deduct VAT.
Although they do not have to pay sales tax, small business owners are required to register with the tax office and file an annual sales tax return.
A small businessman can explain the non-application of § 19 (1) UStG.
This declaration is binding for the following five years.
He may then invoke the VAT and deduct the pre-tax.
Non-resident taxpayers may appoint a Fiscal Representative (§ 22a UStG).
A precondition for this is that they only make tax-free sales and waive the deduction.
The fiscal representative fulfills the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur, so that he does not have to register for the purposes of the VAT.
The accounts indicate that a fiscal representative has been appointed.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation in the two countries is different.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first requirement for registration (among others) is to exceed the threshold amount specified in the VAT Act.
If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he can register voluntarily.
The registration procedure in Germany is standardised, but due to different organisational structures in the different federal states, differences can occur.
In the Czech Republic, the taxable person receives a tax number at the time of his first registration for any tax.
In the case of its registration for the VAT, this tax number also applies to intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, an entrepreneur who registers for sales tax purposes receives a tax number exclusively for intra-German sales.
If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must specifically request the allocation of a USt-IdNr..
Both NKÚ and BRH found that the German two-tier registration system in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which grants a single identification number for both national VAT registration and intra-Community transactions, can lead to significant misunderstandings.
On the other hand, the two-stage system allows retroactive (national) registration in cases where the taxman does not register his business activities with the municipality or the competent FA.
This retroactive registration allows a valid predisposition to the value added tax for previous investment periods, in particular an accurate estimate of the VAT debt.
As the different registration procedures cause problems, the rules should be harmonised across the EC.
The German Parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number.
This is to be allocated by the Federal Central Office of Taxation to each natural person after birth.
This number is valid for natural persons resident in Germany for life.
When a natural person commits a business activity, the competent FA applies for a commercial tax identification number, which serves as the USt-IdNr..
In the future, therefore, there should be no delay between the national registration of a tax subject and the allocation of the USt-IdNr..
Work on the implementation of an IT procedure for the administration of numbers has not yet been completed.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach
The legal regulations in the Czech Republic
According to the provisions of § 70 of Law No. 235 / 2004, since 1 May 2004 the carriage of passengers between the individual Member States as well as between the Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic is exempt from VAT and is entitled to deduction of VAT.
The exemption from VAT also applies if the transport of persons who are registered as tax subject in other Member States or foreigners who are tax subject in their own country is carried out.
The return journey is considered to be a separate transport procedure.
If non-resident entrepreneurs do not carry out any economic activity in the Czech Republic other than cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach, they are not obliged to register as taxable entities in the Czech Republic.
In the Czech Republic, cross-border passenger transport has been exempted from VAT in accordance with the Act on the Accession of the Czech Republic Annex V, Chapter 5 (1) (b), which states in the text:
"For the purpose of applying Article 28 (3) (b) of Directive 77 / 388 / EEC, the Czech Republic may, pursuant to point 17 in Annex F of the Directive, maintain the exemption for cross-border passenger transport either until the conditions of Article 28 (4) of the Directive are met or until the same exemption is applied by any of the current Member States."
The legal regulations in Germany
Pursuant to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006, as transposed in Germany by § 3b (1) UStG, a carriage service shall be carried out where the carriage is effected.
Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and cross-border passenger transport.
Only the domestic part of the transport service is taxable in Germany.
Nor does German taxation distinguish between resident and non-resident (bus) entrepreneurs.
If a non-resident taxable person is transported through Germany, the part of the carriage which is attributable to Germany is deemed to be taxable.
Before providing its services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must notify his intention to provide passenger transport services to the competent FA.
This registers it for tax purposes (compare 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for each motor bus mentioned in the registration of the tax subject.
The entrepreneur must state his taxable transport services in a German VAT declaration.
As of 1 March 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered with the Chemnitz-Süd FA.
If the transport service is provided for a domestically resident entrepreneur, the non-resident taxpayer does not have to pay the VAT himself to the FA.
In its place, the domestic customer of the services has to pay the VAT to the tax office and the net amount invoiced to the non-resident taxpayer. This process is called the "transfer of tax liability" and is in accordance with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC.
In addition to the registration by a non-resident tax preparer and his income tax return, the German tax administration has several means of verifying the accuracy of the tax return with regard to taxable passenger transportation:
Customs mobile control groups check the certificates of buses registered abroad, which are used for passenger transport through Germany.
After each inspection, the mobile control groups submit an inspection report to the competent FA.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group may require the bus driver to pay VAT before continuing his journey.
The non-resident taxpayer may deduct the VAT paid in this way from the tax liability stated in his VAT return.
If the FA has doubts about the accuracy of a VAT declaration, it may order an audit to be carried out in the FA or use the means of mutual assistance referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 (see no. 4.6).
Even if the foreign taxable person refuses to pay the legally established value added tax, the FA may request administrative assistance in accordance with Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC.
The BRH considers these means of administrative assistance in tax matters for the verification of the VAT declaration or the compliance with the tax law by a non-resident bus operator to be too burdensome in relation to the low income from the VAT on taxable passenger transport.
In particular, auditing the books of a non-resident tax preparer causes disproportionately high costs for the tax preparer himself and for the tax administration.
The latter must check the foreign books, which requires not only knowledge of the foreign language but also of the foreign accounting principles.
Accordingly, in the case of such an examination, a higher amount of time is to be expected than in the case of a resident tax inspector, although the examination is limited to the passenger transport carried out in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident taxpayer must accept not only the audit rights of his national tax administration, but also those of the other Member States, insofar as he carries out passenger transport there.
In addition, for each Member State in which even a single passenger transport is carried out, the taxing entity must comply with all existing tax legislation in the various languages and on the basis of the forms of the financial administrations of the EC Member States concerned.
Thus, the correct taxation of cross-border passenger transport services leads to a disproportionate administrative burden.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation is different in the two countries.
In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between different EC Member States as well as between Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT under the Czech Republic's Act of Accession to the EC.
In Germany, the transport service is subject to turnover tax in accordance with the route of carriage which falls within German territory.
If a non-resident taxpayer provides such a transport service for the first time, he must notify this to the competent FA in advance.
This registers the taxable person who has to declare the taxable part of the transport service in a tax return in Germany.
Law enforcement in Germany is very time-consuming.
At least three out of four Czech tax fleets registered with the Chemnitz-South FA have passenger transport as a business purpose.
The amount of tax involved is quite low in relation to the administrative burden.
The Member States which levy VAT in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common VAT system have a high administrative burden in relation to the relevant tax burden.
In order to avoid the disproportionate costs of VAT, cross-border passenger transport should only be taxable in one Member State.
This could be the state in which the carriage begins or where the service provider is resident.
Such a form of taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006.
Sales tax returns
Taxation and processing of VAT declarations in the Czech Republic
Insofar as the law does not stipulate otherwise, the entrepreneur, even if no tax liability has arisen, is obliged to file a VAT return on the pre-print provided by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the expiry of the tax period.
The tax liability arises with the expiry of the deadline for submitting the VAT declaration. According to Law No. 235 / 2004, the VAT on the import of goods is excluded from this regulation. Here, the due date of the tax is determined according to the customs regulations.
In the event of a refund claim resulting from higher than average deductible taxes, this amount will be refunded to the taxable person within 30 days of the determination of this deduction, without the need for an application.
The time limit shall not be applied in cases in which the tax officer initiates a tax procedure concerning the tax liability of the taxable person.
Pursuant to § 73 (11) of Law No. 235 / 2004, the right to deduction may be asserted at the latest with the regular tax return for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the claim to deduction of deduction arose.
After the expiry of this period, the deduction can still be claimed within three years of the end of the period in which the claim would have been possible for the first time.
However, this requires the submission of a supplementary tax return.
An amendment to Law No. 235 / 2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, allows the submission of a supplementary VAT declaration only for the period during which the right to deduction of VAT could have been claimed for the first time.
A tax litigant must file a supplementary VAT declaration if: a) the sum of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax liability, b) he makes corrections by which the last known tax liability is not changed, but only previous information is changed, c) he makes corrections to the VAT rate and the tax debt in accordance with § 49 of Law No. 235 / 2004.
A tax preparer may file a supplementary VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax liability.
The taxpayer must file the supplementary tax return by the end of the month following the month in which the facts in question were established.
Revenue tax returns can be filed electronically either via the Internet or via data carriers.
The delivery via Internet can be made with or without a certified electronic signature.
If it is done without an electronic signature, it must also be submitted on a medium.
The preprint for the VAT declaration contains separate lines for indicating the value of intra-Community supplies and purchases.
The value of related services must be stated in separate lines of the VAT declaration.
Some headings are used for automated primary controls within the framework of the ATIS system.
The value of the goods delivered to other EC Member States to persons registered there as taxable will be compared with the data provided by the Czech tax authorities in their Summary Notices.
The value of purchases of goods from other Member States by persons registered as taxable persons is compared by means of the MIAS with the information contained in the Summary Statements of tax fleets from other EC Member States.
Within the framework of the ATIS system, a credibility check of VAT returns is carried out by the FA.
This is done automatically, as the VAT declaration cannot be processed without the prior examination.
The credibility test involves a calculation of the measures of credibility and an assessment of the risks of VAT returns.
According to the provisions of § 37 (1) of Law Nr. 337 / 1992, the FA may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who do not comply with their non-monetary obligations under this or a special tax law or a decision under this law.
Automated tax information system - Automated tax information system used by Czech tax offices for technical support of tax collection.
The NKÚ found during its examination that the FÄ rarely made use of the possibility of imposing a financial penalty on the tax subject if he did not file the VAT return.
Tax and processing of VAT declarations in Germany
In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly VAT pre-registrations and the annual VAT declaration.
Those tax preparers who are required to file VAT pre-registrations must nevertheless file an annual VAT return.
Even small business owners who are not required to pay VAT must file an annual VAT return.
The taxable persons are generally obliged to make a VAT pre-registration (§ 18 (2) UStG) until 10 days after the end of the calendar quarter in which the VAT is generated.
However, if the VAT liability is more than €6,136 in the previous year or if the company is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur is obligated to make monthly VAT pre-registrations at the latest up to 10 days after the expiry of the relevant month.
The taxable person can also opt for the submission of monthly VAT pre-registrations if he received a refund of more than €6,136 in the previous year (§ 18 (2a) UStG).
If the annual sales tax is not more than €512, neither VAT pre-registrations nor VAT declarations are required.
Any resulting VAT liability shall be paid 10 days after the expiry of the tax period.
A refund can lead to a more thorough audit by the financial administration.
(Legal) deadlines for the processing of VAT returns and for the reimbursement of VAT overpayments do not exist.
In order to receive a timely refund, a security for the refund amount can be offered.
In principle, VAT declarations, including reimbursement cases, must be processed quickly.
The German sales tax law allows an extension of these (delivery or payment) deadlines (§ 18 (6) UStG).
The extension of the deadline must be requested separately.
If it is granted, the VAT pre-registration and the corresponding payments may be made one month later. However, in the case of monthly notifications, a special advance payment is to be made.
This payment will be offset against the VAT liability established for the pre-notification period of December.
If an error is discovered, the entrepreneur must submit a corrected VAT pre-registration.
There is no "supplementary" VAT declaration.
Once the VAT declaration to be filed by 31 May of the following year has been filed with the tax office, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect VAT declaration, but only the incorrect annual VAT declaration.
Corrections of this VAT declaration to the advantage or disadvantage of the taxable person are possible within four years of the end of the year in which the first VAT declaration was filed.
After the expiry of this four-year period, a VAT declaration can normally only be corrected in cases of light-hearted tax reduction or tax evasion.
Taxpayers must submit VAT pre-registrations electronically.
The FÄ may grant exceptions to this rule in order to avoid unfavourable hardship.
The annual VAT declaration can be made either in paper form or via the Internet with or without certification.
If the delivery is made without certification, the tax administrator must also make the declaration on paper and with his personal signature.
If no VAT pre-registrations or declarations are made, the tax administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the turnover achieved by the taxable person 6.
In case of a late levy, the taxable person may be subject to a late surcharge (up to 10% of the tax liability or up to an amount of €25,000).
In an earlier investigation, the BRH found that the FÄ often do not levy this late surcharge.
In cases where the FÄ levied the late fees, the amount was set in an uneven and arbitrary manner.
The delay surcharge therefore misses its purpose of reducing the average delay, in particular when submitting the annual VAT return.
The preprint of the VAT declaration contains separate lines for value indications for intra-Community deliveries or purchases.
There are also separate lines for the provision of services.
Non-taxable sales are to be indicated in a separate line of the VAT declaration.
The VAT returns submitted on paper must either be scanned or electronically recorded by specially designated personnel.
The data of electronically filed tax returns are immediately available to the tax administration.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
After all data is electronically collected, they are subjected to a risk management procedure and a case selection is made on the basis of certain benchmarks.
The selected VAT declarations must be checked by the competent official on the basis of the automatically generated test references (see 5.2).
Although the tax administration only has to make a rough estimate of the VAT liability, it still has to be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, tax preparers must file their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the end of the tax period.
Depending on the turnover of the taxable person, the taxable period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
Depending on the amount of their tax liability of the previous year, tax filers in Germany have to file their prior filings at the latest 10 days after either the end of the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
The annual declaration of VAT must be made by 31 May of the following year at the latest.
The ability to file an annual VAT declaration has a number of advantages and disadvantages:
+ After the end of the calendar year, the tax administrator may correct the errors in the monthly pre-registrations by submitting a single VAT return;
- if the taxable person corrects his or her information on intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be attributed to a specific reporting period of the ICM;
- The Länder do not collect MIAS data on intra-Community acquisitions of German tax preparers until the annual VAT declarations have usually been processed.
According to the registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs must file a VAT declaration regardless of the amount of their turnover.
This levy will enable the German tax administration to verify compliance with the turnover ceiling for small entrepreneurs.
In addition, the competent FA may compare the annual declaration of VAT with the corresponding declarations for direct taxes and with the annual financial statements of the company concerned.
In the Czech Republic, the Internal Revenue Service can only check the level of turnover on the basis of the income tax return that has been issued.
In contrast to the current regulations in the Czech Republic, German tax authorities are obliged to issue the VAT pre-registration electronically.
The introduction of the electronic filing of tax returns in the Czech Republic would increase the effectiveness of the Czech tax administration.
A summary of the reports
Presentation and processing of summary notices in the Czech Republic
In accordance with the provisions of § 102 of the Law No. 235 / 2004, an entrepreneur who supplies goods to a person registered in another Member State for tax purposes is obliged to make such summary reports (hereinafter referred to as "ZM").
The value of the goods delivered shall always be stated in Czech currency in accordance with the USt-IdNr7, the individual tax brackets under which they are registered in the other Member State.
Information about services is not provided in the ZM.
Taxpayers with a calendar monthly or quarterly tax period must submit the ZM to the local competent FA no later than the 25th day after the end of each quarter.
Incorrect data must be corrected in a correction TIM within 15 days of the error being identified.
Faulty data in the ZM will always be replaced by data from the correction ZM.
Similar to tax returns, tax filers can also file their returns electronically.
In the event that a tax officer does not provide a CM or a correction CZK, even though he is required to do so in accordance with Law Nr. 235 / 2004, the financial officer shall ask him to hand over the relevant CZM, pointing out the consequences of the non-payment. In the event of non-fulfilment of non-monetary obligations, the financial officer shall be authorised to impose repeated fines of up to CZK 2 million in accordance with § 37 of Law Nr. 337 / 1992.
The NKÚ found in its investigation that the FÄ mostly did not use its power to impose fines on defaulting tax evaders.
In particular, the tax faculty are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations, as the failure to pay the ZM does not affect the amount of their VAT debt.
Pursuant to § 102 (5) of Law Nr. 235 / 2004, the financial officer is obliged to check the information in the ZM or Correction ZM, to remove any ambiguity and to use the information to determine the tax liability.
In case of non-conformity
8 of the information in the ZM with which The Tax Administrator corrects incorrect information in the ZM by submitting a correction ZM either on his own initiative or on request.
The financial officer has to correct the data on the delivery of goods to other Member States in the ATIS system if:
- the taxable person does not prove the correctness of the information reported in the ZM (or Correction ZM) and therefore corrects it by submitting a correction ZM,
- the financial officer has proved the inaccuracy of the information reported by the taxable person in the ZM or Correction ZM.
Corrections entered by the tax officer, without a correction ZM having been issued by the taxable person, do not replace the platitude of the taxable person to submit a correction ZM, but only lead to the correction of the data in the MIAS, so that they are up to date, complete and accurate.
The data from the ICs will be forwarded to the Member States concerned.
Only the national tax authority, designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the field of VAT, is allowed to transmit and receive this data.
This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic, this function is carried out by the Department of International Mutual Assistance in the field of VAT in the Ministry of Finance) and the message "O _ MCTL" is automatically sent to the CLO from the other Member States.
It contains all incorrect USt-IdNr., which were specified in the transmitted ZM lines.
If the incorrect USt-IdNr. is used in some of the transmitted lines of the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry is made in the list of the wrong USt-IdNr.
The list contains a "message about doubts regarding USt-IdNr."
The financial officer checks the data and enters the result of the check into the system.
When purchasing goods from another Member State, the taxable person must state this in his VAT return and enter the value of the purchase in the lines of the VAT return intended for this purpose.
The CLO will forward selected cases of differences between the value of the purchases made by the Czech taxable person in his VAT return and the value of the goods delivered by the supplier from the other Member State in his ZM to the competent FA for examination.
The experts there must investigate the discrepancies.
Three different situations can then occur:
a) The value specified by the Czech acquirer in the relevant headings of its VAT return is lower than the value of the supplies supplied by suppliers from other EC Member States.
In this case, the financial officer checks the accuracy of the information.
b) The difference is zero.
This situation can result either from a change in the information within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects his VAT return) or from a change in the information in the VAT return (the Czech tax preparer in the meantime issues a supplementary VAT declaration on his own initiative).
In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax officer to verify the accuracy of the information in the VAT return.
c) The value of the goods purchased from other Member States, which the Czech taxable person has indicated in his VAT return, is higher than the value of the goods delivered by the suppliers of the other EC Member States.
Again, it is at the discretion of the financial officer to check the accuracy of the information.
After verifying the differences and clarifying the reasons for their appearance, the financial officer enters the results of his review into ATIS.
These results will be forwarded to the CLO.
The number of transactions sent for examination by the CLO for each quarter of 2005 can be seen in graph No. 1 (Source: Czech Ministry of Finance).
Graphic 1 above shows that the number of cases submitted by the CLO to the FÄ for the individual quarters of 2005 has decreased.
The significant reduction in the number of cases in the fourth quarter of 2005 is due, among other things, to the fact that the Czech CLO has raised the threshold for case selection, taking into account the minimum amount limit for requests for information to the other EC Member States.
Differences between the information in the VAT returns and the data from the EC do not always have to be based on an error by the domestic purchaser.
There may also be an error of the taxable person in another Member State or an error caused by the fact that certain types of supplies are indicated differently in the TIMs in different Member States of the EC.
The most frequent reasons for deviations in the value of reported business transactions can be seen in Table 1.
Presentation and processing of the summary reports in Germany
Entrepreneurs who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EC Member States or who participate in triangular transactions must submit quarterly reports listing intra-Community deliveries by acquirer (§ 18a (1) UStG).
The tender must be made no later than the 10th day of the month following the calendar quarter in question.
If a long-term extension is granted for the submission of VAT declarations, this shall also apply to the ZM.
The ZM shall be submitted to the CLO.
The electronic levy has been in effect since 1 January 2007.
The competent FA may allow exemptions for individual tax areas in order to avoid unfavourable hardship.
If the controller determines that the ZM was faulty, he is required to submit a correction ZM within one month.
In the case of non-submission of the CZM, the CLO initiates an enforcement procedure.
This includes the following steps: - first reminder - second reminder, coupled with the threat of a penalty and - fixing the penalty.
Although the German tax code allows the imposition of a penalty payment of up to €25,000 (§ 329 AO), the CLO imposes penalties of €125, 250 and 500 in three stages.
In addition, § 26a (1) Nr. 5 UStG stipulates that the controller acts improperly, if he intentionally or recklessly issues a ZM not correctly, not completely or not in time, or if he does not correct a ZM or does not correct it in time.
This infringement can be punishable by a fine of up to €5,000.
Data on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered by the FÄ into the MIAS, because the processing of the ZM is the exclusive responsibility of the CLO.
The data of the ZM are stored only at the CLO.
The information from the summary reports is only available to the FÄ after processing by the CLO.
The time limits for processing CCGs are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003.
The data of the ZM must be stored within three months of the relevant calendar quarter (in MIAS).
In case of incorrect USt-IdNr. in the ZM of German tax preparers, the German CLO will receive a message "O _ MCTL" from the other Member State.
The CLO then turns to the entrepreneur and asks for the right data.
If the CLO does not manage to obtain the correct information, the case will be referred to the relevant FA.
It is then up to them to request the correct information.
In the course of its examination, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs corrected the USt-IdNr. at the request of the CLO.
However, the reminder, as well as the threat and imposition of up to three consecutive fines, takes too much time when a tax evader may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.
The cases that were finally reported to the competent FÄ were usually closed within one to two months.
The competent FA refused to grant tax exemption for the notified intra-Community supplies in 73% of these forgeries.
If the controller provided the correct USt-IdNr., the FA asked him to submit a corrected ZM to the CLO, because the FÄ cannot correct the MIAS data itself.
The BRH found that neither the FÄ nor the CLO controlled the release of the corrected ZM.
Therefore, the tax authorities often did not comply with the request. Since the CLO does not have access to the data of the VAT returns, there is no comparison of the data on goods deliveries made in the VAT declarations or the VAT declaration with the corresponding data in the ZM before these data are sent to the CLO of the other Member States.
This comparison can only be made by the FÄ. This is usually done during the preparation of a special VAT audit.
Data received from other Member States will be processed by CLO.
Incorrect USt-IdN are detected and reported to the Member States concerned.
The data will be used for the control of income tax in the Member States.
As soon as they are available in the system, the CLO compares with data from previous calendar quarters.
If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control notices will be drawn up and sent to the competent FÄ.
This happens continuously, whereas an auction of the acquisition data of all sales tax fleets is later compiled and forwarded to the FÄ.
The risk management system (RMS) for the investment process then compares this data with those for intra-Community acquisitions.
The system fully verifies (only) those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct the deduction.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, tax preparers who have made intra-Community deliveries to a person registered for VAT in another Member State are required to submit a CZM to the local competent FA within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter.
The FÄ process the ZM and forward the data to the CLO.
The values of the intra-Community deliveries notified by the tax authorities in the ZM shall be compared at the FÄ with the values of intra-Community deliveries specified by the same tax authorities in their VAT declarations.
The results of the reconciliation will be taken into account in the tax setting process.
In Germany, tax preparers who have made intra-Community deliveries are required to file quarterly returns within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter.
Since 1 January 2007, tax inspectors have to submit the ZM electronically to the CLO.
The data from the ZM are only available to the FÄ after processing by the CLO.
Both in the Czech Republic and in Germany, the tax authorities in the ZM state only the delivery of goods.
The provision of services is not specified in the ZM. In contrast to the Czech FÄ, the German FÄ cannot itself correct incorrect information in individual lines of the given ZM.
Due to this limited access to the German MIAS data, incorrect USt-IdNr. was not corrected even if the correct USt-IdNr. was communicated to the FA by the controller.
The German tax administration does not compare the information on intra-Community deliveries provided by German tax authorities in their VAT pre-registrations with the information provided by the corresponding ZM.
Differences between the pre-registration data and the ZM are not regularly disclosed until the German CLO transmits the MIAS data to other Member States.
Based on these findings of the BRH, it is obvious that a comparison would improve the reliability of the transmitted MIAS data.
Data on goods delivered by other Member States to Czech tax authorities will be compared in the Czech Republic with data on purchases of goods stated by Czech tax authorities in their VAT returns.
The Czech CLO makes the comparison for each calendar quarter separately.
The most serious cases of deviations are forwarded to the FÄ for examination.
Unlike the Czech tax administration, the German tax administration does not generally examine the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.
Such a general control will only be carried out in the case of tax evaders who are not fully entitled to deduct the deduction.
In addition, the German tax administration controls the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other tax entities only if the RMS produces a test reference or if the tax subject has already been selected for an audit.
This procedure relieves the FÄ of the need to clarify the reasons for any differences.
On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
In order to combat carousel fraud, updated information on intra-Community purchases must be available as early as possible.
The current system of CCNs, in particular MIAS, provides information to the financial authorities that may well be half a year old.
This time delay could be reduced to up to four months if the tax fleets had to submit monthly ZM.
The monthly levy would only insignificantly increase the bureaucratic burden, as most tax evaders in the Czech Republic and Germany are already required to file monthly VAT returns or pre-registrations and no more information is required for the ZM than for VAT returns or advance declarations.
In order to avoid red tape, the ZM levy could be combined with the levy of VAT returns and / or advance declarations.
However, a shift to the monthly levy of SDRs would cause more periodic discrepancies between the information on intra-Community supplies and those on intra-Community purchases and would increase the flow of data between CLO.
In 2006, the German government considered the general introduction of monthly SDRs.
The implementation failed because of the objections of the federal states.
They feared that a monthly forwarding of MIAS data to the CLO of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In order for the concentration on the monthly levy to be effective, it is necessary to agree on the single monthly levy at European level, so that it is possible to update the MIAS data monthly.
Statistical information on goods deliveries and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany
In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.
The total turnover of intra-Community trade between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Table No 2.
Both Court of Auditors requested data on the number of incorrect tax numbers or USt-IdNr. in the O _ MCTL messages exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for each of the quarters audited.
These data can be found in the following tables.
They have significant differences.
The reason for the differences may be a different calculation basis for the number of O _ MCTL messages.
While the Czech CLO refers the figures to the calendar quarter for which the ZM was issued, the German CLO refers its figures to the calendar quarter in which O _ MCTLmessage was received.
International exchange of information at level 3
Implementation of international information exchange in the Czech Republic
The international exchange of information makes it possible for tax officials to obtain information from other Member States on intra-Community transactions and on the tax transactions that they have carried out.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 on mutual assistance in the field of VAT repealing Directive (EEC) No 218 / 92 (hereinafter "Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003)") distinguishes between two basic types of exchange of information: exchange of information on request and spontaneous exchange of information (without prior request).
The international exchange of information on request is carried out by means of a request for information (RFI) using the standardized SCAC form.
The financial officials in the Czech Republic send their RFI or their responses to an RFI received by the Finance Directorate to the CLO. The CLO is responsible for translating the information provided in the standardized SCAC form into the foreign language and forwarding it to the other Member States.
In addition, CLO receives requests for information (RFI) from other Member States and replies to requests sent. It ensures their translation into Czech and their distribution to the competent FÄ for processing.
Art. 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 sets a maximum period of three months from receipt of the request for its processing.
All RFIs exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany during the tested period have been audited by NKÚ.
Out of the total number of 94 RFIs received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74,5%) were dealt with within the three-month period; a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) exceeded this time limit.
In the remaining one case, no reply had been sent to Germany until the NKÚ had examined it. More detailed information on the time limits within which requests made by Germany were answered by the Czech Republic can be found in Figure 2.
The total number of 335 requests for information (RFI) sent from the Czech Republic to Germany resulted in 136 responses (i.e. 40.6%) within the three-month period; a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were processed after this period and in 19 cases no reply had yet been received from Germany (in the remaining one case, due to the stated information, it was not possible to determine when Germany had replied to the request for information).
More detailed information on the deadlines within which requests for information from the Czech Republic and Germany were answered can be found in Graphic No. 3.
The percentages of intra-Community turnover reported in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in graphic no. 4.
The above graph shows that sales audited in connection with requests for information generally had values of more than €60,000.
The international exchange of information without prior request takes place either automatically, structured automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.
Information relevant to the determination of VAT liability is often transmitted to tax officials in other Member States without prior request.
In the Czech Republic, all information is collected by the CLO.
The exchange of information between the various Member States will take place electronically.
"Automatic exchange" in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 means the systematic transmission of previously established information to other Member States at regular, pre-determined intervals without prior request.
"Structured automatic exchange" means the systematic transmission of previously established information to another Member State without prior request, as soon as the relevant information is available.
The Czech Republic informs the other Member States in the automatic exchange of information on deliveries of new vehicles.
This information is obtained by the financial officer from the form reporting the delivery of a new vehicle in accordance with § 19 of the Law No. 235 / 2004 and from the copy of the invoice issued.
When processing this form, the financial officer will enter the required data in the relevant document and forward it directly to the responsible employee of the Financial Directorate, where this data will be collected and sent to the CLO for further processing. After that, the data will be transmitted to the other Member States within the specified time limit, namely within two months at the latest after the end of the quarter in which it was obtained.
The Czech Republic will also provide other Member States with information on mail order transactions that are tax-free in the country of origin, on intra-Community transactions that appear to be inadmissible and on potential missing traders.
This information will be transmitted to the other Member States by means of an SCAC imprint in a spontaneous exchange of information.
Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany
In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information originates from the local competent FA.
The FÄ send the completed preprint SCAC 2004 by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which forwards the SCACpreprints to the foreign CLO.
The FÄ are instructed to write their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the used SCACprint is one-page.
Half of the German requests for information examined by the BRH were sent in order to ensure the taxation of profits in the other Member State or to demonstrate the tax-free status of intra-Community supplies from Germany to the other Member State.
If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it checks whether the value of the supplies referred to in the request exceeds the minimum limit of €15,000.
If there is no adequate justification for the request, the German CLO refuses to provide information regarding a turnover that is below the minimum amount limit.
In addition, the German CLO provides the translation of the freely worded texts in the SCAC preprint [(B1-17) or (E), if they are not written in either German or English.
In order to respond to the request for information, the CLO shall forward it to the competent FA, referring to the three-month period.
No further deadlines have been set at the various levels of the German treasury.
Although the German CLO has the technical means to monitor compliance with the deadline, it does not have the necessary personnel capacity to remind the FÄ to respond to unfinished requests for information.
The FÄ receive the necessary information by writing a letter from the controller or carrying out an external inspection.
The external auditors usually choose between two forms of audit: the special VAT audit, which covers all tax-related transactions over a period of several months, or the so-called VAT review, which may only refer to a recent transaction.
In this short and ﬂexible form of examination, an announcement to the tax inspector is not necessary and it has proved its worth in the examination of a single transaction.
With regard to the automatic exchange of information, Germany shall provide the following information to the other Member State: - on USt-IdNr., which have been allocated to undertakings established in other EC Member States, - on the reimbursement of pre-tax payments to entrepreneurs established in other EC Member States.
In addition, Germany has committed itself to providing the following information to the other EC Member States in the framework of the structured automatic exchange of information:
a. The supply of new vehicles to entrepreneurs without VAT, b. Distance sales (mail order) to other EC Member States which are not subject to VAT in Germany, c. Significant differences between the purchases reported by a taxable person and the MIAS data transmitted by other Member States, i.e. intra-Community deliveries of goods which have been incorrectly subject to taxation in Germany by the tax authorities. Potential "Missing Traders" who have made intra-Community sales, regardless of whether their UI number is still valid or has already been deleted, as well as tax evaders who have made intra-Community deliveries to the USD or misuse of a number.
Comparison and evaluation
The request for information or spontaneous information is sent both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the initiative of the local competent FÄ, who send the appropriate SCACPrinters to the CLO.
While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCACPrinters (Czech-English) and translates information given into English or German, the German FÄ follow the instruction to write requests for information or spontaneous requests on a one-language form only in German.
The German CLO does not make translations of German texts.
When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany between 1 May 2004 and 31 December 2005, NKÚ found that 74.5% of requests for information received were dealt with by the Czech tax administration within the three-month period, while requests for information sent to Germany were dealt with by the German tax administration in 40.6% of cases within that period.
Although the German CLO refers the FÄ to the three-month period, it does not monitor its compliance.
Due to the lack of reminders, a high proportion of requests for information that have been answered for a limited period of time occur.
For this reason, the BRH has recommended a continuous reminder procedure to the German CLO.
The situation has now changed.
According to the information available to us, the German CLO is now reminding the tax offices to reply to the outstanding requests for information.
Sales tax risk management
Risk Management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several organisational units at different levels of financial management are involved in risk management in the field of turnover tax.
Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organisational units are responsible for risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:
The Department of Methodology and Economic Administration of the VAT or its Risk Management Unit deals with the identification of potential risk areas for the tax revenue and evaluates the trends in these risks in domestic and intra-Community trade.
At national level, this body coordinates the requirements for the "credibility of VAT returns" criterion and uses the MIAS data to detect possible tax evasion in the context of intra-Community supplies and purchases.
Based on data on the Czech Republic's trade balance, it evaluates high-risk goods, prepares the concept of risk management in the area of VAT and cooperates in this area with the relevant EC institutions and other Member States.
The department for international administrative assistance in the field of VAT provides inter alia for the exchange of information, participates in the creation and creation of a relevant information database, evaluates the data available from other Member States in the MIAS system, carries out publicity work and is responsible for other forms of intergovernmental assistance within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003.

The Tax Audit and Investigation Unit carries out risk analyses in the context of the methodological management of tax audits, sets priorities for the work planning of the financial directorates with regard to the selection of cases to be examined, produces risk analyses to combat tax evasion and, in this context, collects information from the tax administration and other sources and makes proposals for measures to combat tax evasion.
Tax investigators exist in the financial directorates. Their tasks include the search for tax subject areas and sectors which are high-risk in terms of the frequency of tax evasion (e.g. Internet transactions, gold, pharmaceutical industry), the search for unregistered tax subject (e.g. in the sectors of Internet services, job placement, electronic and print media, etc.), the investigation of links in cases of chain fraud and the provision of information to the local tax authorities.
Special examination units have been set up in 12 selected subjects.
These have a regional competence and, with the appropriate authorisation, carry out tax audits outside the local jurisdiction of the FÄ.
The need to set up special audit units resulted from the increase in detected new and "improved" forms of tax evasion, particularly linked to chain transactions.
These special units check according to the needs of tax investigators or concentrate on tax fugitives with specific activities, multinational companies and tax fugitives with particularly high turnover.
The following mechanisms for reducing the risks in the field of VAT have been integrated into the ATIS system: - the task of "credibility of VAT returns" to assess the risk-bearing nature of tax returns, - the task of "selection of the tax areas to be examined," whereby the tax areas to be examined are selected on the basis of certain criteria - the task of "MIAS," which enables tax officials to access data provided by the other EC Member States.
The task "MIAS" enables inter alia: - verification of the validity of the USt-IdNr. of tax fleets from other Member States, - confirmation of the value of the goods delivered to a Czech taxable person, as indicated in the ZM by all suppliers of the tax plane in question from other Member States, - creation of a list of tax fleets who have not submitted ZM - formal control of the information provided by tax authorities in the Czech Republic in their ZM before these data are transmitted to other Member States - preparation of a list of tax fledgling persons whose VAT returns and other goods delivered to other Member States do not correspond to the value of all the goods purchased by ZM in the other Member States, and whose VAT declarations from the other Member States do not correspond to the ZM with the value of all the goods purchased in the other Member States.
As part of their mission to combat tax evasion, tax officials have access to data from public authorities such as commercial registers, land registers, motor vehicle registers, commercial registers, etc.
More detailed information can be found in Section 4.4.1 Submission and processing of the Summary Notices in the Czech Republic.
Risk Management in Germany
Because of its federal structure, both the federal ﬁnance authorities (in particular the CLO) and the financial administrations of the 16 Länder are involved in the development and implementation of an RMS in the Federal Republic of Germany.
While there are joint development working groups, neither the CLO nor the federal tax administrations have a fully unified set of data.
At the level of the CLO, the unit ST I 2 (hereinafter referred to as "KUSS" - Coordination Centre for VAT Special Examinations and Tax Investigations) collects the audit findings on fraud in the OPUS database.
In cooperation with the countries, another database called ZAUBER has been set up at the KUSS. There, the tax offices can enter and query the names of discovered missing traders or VAT fraudsters.
The KUSS coordinates related cases of VAT fraud at national level as well as cases of cross-border VAT fraud.
The experience of the KUSS is incorporated into the development of the RMS through its participation in the working groups.
In addition, experts from several other CLO and BMF organisational units are also involved.
The formal review of the composition of other Member States' UICC No., which appear in the ZM German Tax Issues, will be carried out by the CLO.
This formal review takes place prior to the transmission of the ICM to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of the MIAS data and thus its benefits (s. 4.4.2).
Examination of the validity of USt-IdNr. referred to in the SDM is carried out on the basis of O _ MCTL identifications transmitted by the other Member States (see also 4.4.2 for the procedure for rectifying invalid USt-IdNr.).
In addition, the CLO's RMS is based on MIAS data transmitted by the other Member States and generates various types of communications for the detection of suspected missing traders. Certain characteristics are used as clues, which usually occur in carousel transactions.
The FÄ of the federal states are instructed to process these communications and to forward the results of their investigations in certain cases to the CLO.
The BRH audit confirmed that all available features must be included in order to give a sufficient probability of concluding a case of tax fraud (rather than focusing mainly on a company's turnover).
Accordingly, the BRH has recommended to the BMF to work with combinations of different clues in the preparation of the communications.
The risk management system should also take into account other factors, such as the payment behaviour of the taxman, the economic sector or the company's shareholding.
A second level of risk management exists in the financial administrations of the federal states and focuses on the processing of VAT pre-registrations and annual declarations.
For example, the system draws up a list of those tax fleets who have indicated intra-Community deliveries in their VAT pre-registration or annual declaration.
This list will be sent to the CLO for monitoring of the complete submission of the ZM.
Furthermore, in this type of risk management, the acquisitions specified by the taxable person in his annual VAT return are compared with the data in the MIAS.
The tax administrations of the Länder avoid comparing the quarterly data, as this would result in too many discrepancies due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud, such as:
- suppliers and acquirers assume different dates for the execution of intra-Community sales;
- different accounting and tax declaration of discounts and discounts.
In addition to comparing the data from the VAT returns with the MIAS data, many federal states have certain risk management mechanisms that are based on information in the VAT returns and certain other indications (e.g. company wording, age of owners / shareholders, number of employees and method of payment of the tax lien).
Bavaria has introduced a rules-based risk management system that allows a team of tax fraud specialists (hereinafter "risk managers") to program their own rules to identify suspected tax fraudsters.
This system finds the FÄ use when processing the VAT advance reports.
This means that the competent FA receives the information of the RMS before the value added tax is set.
Since this system is not capable of learning, the risk managers must adapt the rules according to the feedback from the FÄ.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has developed an adaptive neural network based on the data of uncovered back-up cases.
Based on this data, the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.
The system draws up a monthly list of tax cases where there is evidence of tax evasion.
On the basis of this list, the competent FÄ decide on the examination of the tax subject.
After the audit, the auditors will have to report their findings so that RMS can learn from the results of the audits it proposes.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rules-based fuzzy system.
Based on a lot of data from processed sales tax returns and some other clues, this Neuro-Fuzzy system (also called the Datamining System) calculates how likely it is that a tax preparer is involved in tax fraud.
It then creates a monthly list of suspected tax fraudsters.
Based on this list, the FÄ select the relevant controllers for testing and report the test results to the relevant data center.
The introduction of these three RMS is under way in the Länder.
As each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three systems for combating fraud appears to be effective.
It remains to be seen whether the hoped-for effects will materialize during actual use.
Comparison and evaluation
Although it is not possible in this report to deal with the specific criteria of RMS in the Czech Republic and Germany, the NKÚ and the BRH have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.
Like the different approaches in the three above-mentioned German Länder, the RMS of each European state has its particular strengths and weaknesses.
There is currently an exchange of experience between the financial authorities of the European Member States on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.
VAT fraud - in particular carousel fraud - has proved to be a European problem, not a national one.
Those involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one Member State, but in several.
A Member State alone cannot develop an effective RMS.
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EC Member State. If this does not happen, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS for their crimes.
The tax losses caused by European-wide VAT fraud do not necessarily affect the Member State in which the initiator is established.
Any other Member State involved in fraud may be affected.
That is why there should be a European exchange of experience on RMS.
Selected results from the examination of individual sales In the context of the parallel tests, the NKÚ and the BRH investigated the quality and usability of information on selected deliveries and / or.
Acquisitions which were the subject of the international exchange of information between the financial administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.
In addition, the two courts jointly examined the processing of several shipments, the execution of which was doubtful, or which the tax authorities of both states stated differently in their tax returns or customs declarations.
At the request of the BRH, NKÚ investigated a total of eight business cases involving between eight Czech and eight German tax authorities.
In addition, in 43 cases, the NKÚ examined the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany that Czech tax authorities had indicated in their tax returns and ZM on the basis of communications from the BRH.
At the request of the NKÚ, the BRH inspected a total of 23 shipments between 23 German and 21 Czech tax authorities.
The relevant information was exchanged solely on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 on CLO.
The examination of the selected cases showed, inter alia, that the different registration procedures in the EC Member States lead to the problems identified in Chapter 4.1:
1 overall pick in the draft.
According to the MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004 a Czech tax preparer purchased goods worth €60,500 from a German tax preparer.
When the Czech tax inspector declared an acquisition of only €29,869, the Czech tax administration sent a request for information to Germany for verification of the value of the goods delivered.
In its reply to the Czech request for information, the German side stated that the German tax inspector in question had delivered goods worth €27,381 to his Czech business partner in the second quarter of 2004, €31,997 in the third quarter and €10,276 in the fourth quarter.
It also emerged from the reply that the USt-IdNr. of the German tax lien was only valid from 28 September 2004. However, the German CLO had granted a further request of the German tax litigant and brought forward the validity of the USt-IdNr. retroactively to 1 May 2004.
The German tax inspector corrected the ZM.
On the basis of this information, it was a (intra-Community) purchase of goods by the Czech tax collector.
By means of a request to the competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that in 2004 the Czech tax inspector had submitted supplementary VAT returns for the individual (under-year) tax periods in which he declared a higher value of purchases from other Member States and, at the same time, requested the deduction of VAT from purchases from other Member States.
On the basis of these additional VAT declarations, the competent person in charge of the Czech tax office could not determine clearly whether the value of the supplies of the above-mentioned German supplier was also included in the declared purchases.
In response to a request for information from NKÚ, the BRH found that the German supplier had been registered as subject to VAT in September 2003.
Je-doch had not asked for the allocation of a USt-IdNr., but only a tax number that finally applies to Germany.
Although it is generally not possible in Germany to retroactively assign a USt-IdNr. to a tax subject, the responsible person in charge of the German tax administration did so retroactively on 1 May 2004.
The German CLO retroactively assigns a USt-IdNr. if the German entrepreneur has not caused the delayed allocation; for example, if the CLO caused the delay after the application of the taxable person for the grant of a USt-IdNr..
In this case, the CLO grants the USt-IdNr. retroactively, because according to § 6 UStG the entrepreneur does not need a valid USt-IdNr. for an intra-Community delivery.
Conversely, a German acquirer does not need the (valid) USt-IdNr. of its supplier to declare the intra-Community acquisition.
Because of these procedural differences between the Member States, the German CLO granted retroactive authorisation in this particular case.
2.
In the context of the international exchange of information, the Czech tax official requested the verification of the German entrepreneur's VAT registration.
The MIAS data indicate the date of registration of 5 March 2005, while a registration certificate issued by the local German FA indicates the date of 1 October 2004.
The German authorities stated in their reply that the German tax lien had been registered on 1 October 2004, but for organisational reasons it was not until 16 February 2005 that a USt-IdNr. was assigned in Germany.
Through a request to the local Czech tax official, NKÚ learned that the tax official had carried out a VAT audit of the Czech tax authorities for the tax periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.
During this examination, the tax office found that the Czech tax administrator had declared in his VAT return services worth CZK 9,897 which he had provided to the German tax authorities prior to their VAT registration (i.e. before 1 October 2004).
The (Czech) tax office determined a tax liability of CZK 1,880 against the Czech tax lien for the third quarter of 2004.
On the basis of the NKÚ's request, the BRH found that the German tax inspector had not been assigned the USt-IdNr. until he notified the FA of his company founded in 2004 on 16 February 2005.
In addition, the FA retroactively registered him as of 1 October 200415 for VAT purposes in order to be able to monitor the submission of the VAT declaration for 2004.
In this VAT declaration, the tax resident stated intra-Community purchases from the Czech Republic worth €160 (approx. 5,000 CZK).
3. In his sales tax declaration for September 2004 and in his ZM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax inspector stated shipments of goods worth 114,615 CZK to a German tax inspector.
When checking the registration of the German taxable person in the MIAS system, the Czech tax official found that this registration was only valid from 11 November 2004 and thus after the goods had been delivered to Germany.
The Czech tax inspector issued a supplementary VAT declaration in which he declared sales from domestic deliveries worth 114,615 CZK and VAT of 21,777 CZK, which he paid.
By means of a request to the local competent FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax inspector subsequently submitted a request for the reopening of the tax procedure in respect of the supplementary VAT declaration. As proof, he submitted a confirmation from the German tax administration that the German tax inspector had been registered since 1 January 2000.
Accordingly, the Czech tax official verified the validity of the registration of the German tax lien in the context of the international exchange of information.
From the German information it emerged that a USt-IdNr. had only been assigned to the German taxable person on 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.
As a result, the Czech tax official rejected the request to reopen the tax procedure.
The BRH found that in this case no intra-Community purchase of goods had taken place, because the German tax inspector had only received a USt-IdNr. on 11 November 2004.
However, the German recipient explained both the acquisition and the intra-Community acquisition as well as the VAT on this and also requested the reimbursement of the same amount of advance taxes.
Because this did not lead to a change in the amount of the tax liability of the German taxable person, the German tax official did not correct the information in the VAT declaration.
Furthermore, the BRH found that the company of the German tax inspector named in the request for information was changed in Germany during the processing of the reply, which led to confusion between two German tax inspectors.
This name change at the German Tax Office also confused the Czech tax official.
4.
In the context of the international exchange of information, the German tax official reviewed the purchase of goods in the first quarter of 2005 by a Czech tax collector of a German tax asset worth €22,686.
By means of a request to the local competent tax official in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax officer had carried out an external audit with the Czech tax inspector to ascertain whether the intra-Community delivery had actually taken place and whether the Czech tax inspector had booked and paid the invoice for the delivery of the goods.
The Czech tax inspector did not declare the intra-Community acquisition in his VAT return, because the German supplier did not specify his USt-IdNr. in the invoice, but only his tax number for business within Germany.
According to the MIAS data, the German taxable person is not registered for VAT in connection with intra-Community transactions until April 21, 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech tax fugitive.
The Czech tax official also requested that the German tax administration send a copy of the registration certificate of the German tax inspector so that he could, if necessary, initiate an appropriate tax procedure.
The Czech FA considered this transaction to be the purchase of goods from a non-entrepreneurial (private) person in Germany and therefore did not impose any VAT on the purchase of the goods from Germany.
The BRH found that, according to German law, a tax preparer who supplies goods to other Member States does not have to have a VAT ID number for intra-Community deliveries in order to qualify for the VAT exemption for such a delivery.
The supplier must have only the purchaser's VAT number in the other Member State and must be able to document the transport of the goods concerned to the other Member State.
In this case, the turnover is a (tax-exempt) intra-Community supply according to German tax law, which should be subject to income tax in the Czech Republic.
It is important, however, that the Czech finance official took note of this business incident, because the supply of a machine of this value did not belong to the core business of the German supplier.
As described in Section 4.6.2, the German CLO rejects requests for information on intra-Community transactions if they are below the minimum limit of €15,000: 5.
According to the MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004 a Czech tax preparer purchased goods worth €12,561 from a German tax preparer.
The Czech tax official carried out an audit for this tax period.
In the context of intergovernmental assistance, the Czech tax administration requested the verification of this delivery of goods by means of an SCAC form.
The Czech tax inspector stated that he had not received the goods, that he had never been in a business relationship with the German company and that the purchase of the goods in question had not been accounted for.
The German tax administration rejected the request for the transmission of documents - contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents - because the turnover was less than €15,000 and no other justification had been given.
As the Czech tax official did not receive documentation for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods, the tax examination was inconclusive and the original tax determination was upheld.
On the basis of a request from the NKÚ, the BRH found that the German taxman acted as "Fiscal Representative 17" (§ 22 (a) - (e) UStG).
The German tax inspector explained these deliveries in his VAT declaration and in the ZM.
His right to tax exemption has been recognised.
On the basis of the communication from the BRH, the German FA will send to the Czech Republic the documents necessary for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods.
Section 4.6.1 showed that the responses of the German tax administration to requests for information exceeded the three-month period more frequently than the responses of the Czech tax administration:
6. During its examination, NKÚ found that on 5 October 2005 the Czech tax administration had sent a request for information on the value of the Wa renders delivered to Germany in the fourth quarter of 2004.
In the ZM for this quarter, the German tax authorities had reported a shipment of goods to the Czech tax authorities worth €86,307; however, the Czech tax authorities only declared the purchase of goods worth €35,314 for the same period in their VAT return.
In response to the request for information received by the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after expiry of the maximum processing period specified in Art 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003, the German side stated that the request for information could not be processed because the German company had been dissolved at the end of 2005.
Because the German tax administration did not comply with the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the necessary documents for taxation in the Czech Republic.
7. In 2005, a Czech tax official requested, by means of a SCAC form, the verification of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German tax collector worth €1,265,554 in the third and fourth quarters of 2004, with evidence of carousels fraud.
The NKÚ found that at the time of its examination a German reply to the request for information had not yet been received.
By means of a request to the local tax official, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax authority had not declared in its VAT declaration the supply of new motor vehicles to this German tax collector in the value of 11.816.103 CZK.
The Czech tax official corrected the information in the tax return and the Czech tax inspector issued a corrected ZM.
Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not forward this request for information to the local competent FA for examination.
Following the notification by the BRH, a special VAT inspection was carried out on the German buyer in Germany. It was established that the purchase of all the vehicles concerned had been correctly taxed and that the vehicles were sold on to other tax authorities in Germany.
8. According to the MIAS data, in the fourth quarter of 2004 the Czech tax inspector purchased a car worth €48,500 from a German tax inspector.
However, the Czech tax inspector did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.
By means of a request to the local tax official in the Czech Republic, NKÚ found that the Czech tax inspector had not filed a VAT return since August 2004.
The Czech tax inspector did not file tax returns even after being requested by the tax official. As a result, on 23 May 2005, the FA fixed the VAT liability at zero for the period October to December 2004.
On 2 June 2005, the CLO issued an instruction for the examination of the above-mentioned delivery from the German tax inspector.
As the Czech tax inspector did not cooperate with the tax official, he sent a request for information on the above-mentioned delivery to Germany.
As the reply to the request for information was only received on 7 February 2007, it was not known, until the conclusion of the audit of NKÚ, how the Czech tax official used the information obtained in the international exchange of information.
Due to the failure to comply with the provisions of the Czech VAT Act, the VAT registration of the Czech tax flotilla has been cancelled with effect from 23 August 2005.
In some cases, only a partial word was sent because, at the time of the audit of NKÚ and BRH, the competent FA had not yet completed the external audit:
9.
In 2005, the Czech tax official requested, by means of an SCAC form, the verification of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German tax collector in the third quarter of 2004, worth €16,991, with evidence of carousel fraud.
In his reply to the request for information, the German tax official stated that he had only the invoices issued by the Czech tax authorities for deliveries worth €16,335.
On the basis of the NKÚ's request, the BRH found that the external audit carried out by the German FA had not yet been completed by the acquirer in Germany.
The German acquirer declared the purchase of goods worth €16,335 twice in its VAT pre-registrations for the months of August and September 2004.
10. In 2005, a Czech tax official requested, by means of a SCAC prescription, the verification of shipments of motor vehicles to a German tax collector worth €198.167 in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, with indications of carousels fraud.
The German tax administration sent a partial reply to the request for information to the Czech Republic, confirming that the German tax inspector had acquired several vehicles and that the investigation in Germany had not yet been completed.
The NKÚ found that the local competent FA had carried out several external audits of the Czech tax inspector in order to verify the deduction of above-average taxes.
However, an unjustified claim has not been established.
The BRH found that the German tax authority had declared in its VAT returns for the period concerned the acquisition of goods from other Member States with a total value of €579.114 and that the examination of the German FA by the acquirer in Germany had not yet been completed.
Section 4.4.1 describes the reasons for the discrepancies between the declaration of intra-Community acquisitions in the VAT declaration of the recipient and the information in the Supplier's ZM.
In the cases examined, it turned out that periodic inconsistencies in en18 or the incorrect declaration of a transaction as an intra-Community delivery of goods were not the most frequent reasons for the differences:
11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States and its allies in the Middle East.
According to data from MIAS, in the first quarter of 2005 the Czech taxable person purchased goods worth €35,716 from the German taxable person, but the Czech taxable person did not declare the purchase.
Since the Czech tax inspector did not cooperate with the tax official and there was no business activity at the company's legal headquarters, the Czech tax official asked for a review of how the German tax inspector had communicated with the Czech tax inspector in the context of the international exchange of information.
The German reply to the request for information showed that, according to the findings of the German tax administration, the Czech tax collector was unknown at the given address and the goods were collected by an agreed freight forwarder.
The total value of the order was €155,000, but the German tax inspector delivered only goods worth €21,659.
The Czech tax inspector sent the German tax inspector a false payment confirmation for the amount of €155,153 in favour of the German tax inspector.
After exposing the fraudulent behaviour of the Czech acquirer, the German tax inspector, with the support of his other Czech customers, was able to recover the material delivered, with the exception of a part worth €7,916.
By means of a request to the local competent FA in the Czech Republic, NKÚ found that, on the basis of the information received, the tax administration subsequently imposed CZK 388.522 on the turnover of goods delivered from other Member States.
Following a request from NKÚ, the BRH confirmed that after corrections, the German supplier had reported only one shipment of goods to the Czech tax authorities worth €7,916.
According to the German legislation, the German tax authority declared the revocation of the delivery and the reduction of the tax base in the quarter of the revocation.
Its ZM contained the following information concerning the Czech tax authorities:
12, according to the Associated Press.
In the context of the international exchange of information, the German tax administration requested, by means of a SCACprepress, the verification of the delivery of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005.
According to the request for information, during the period in question, the Czech tax inspector had supplied goods to the German tax inspector with a total value of €396,126 and provided services worth €11.885.
The NKÚ found that the Czech tax administration had carried out an audit of the Czech tax inspector in order to investigate this delivery.
In response to the request for information, the Czech tax administration announced that the Czech tax inspector had delivered and assembled a production plant to the German one.
The Czech control plant supplied the individual parts of the production plant before the Czech Republic joined the EC and the production plant was installed on the basis of the order after May 1, 2004.
The German tax inspector did not remove the installed production plant and asserted defects.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech tax administrator charged the German one €107,100 for the production plant and €11.885 for services.
The German tax inspector received the reprieve, but did not recognize it and did not pay it.
By means of a request to the local tax official in the Czech Republic, NKÚ found that all invoices had been correctly accounted for in the accounts of the Czech tax inspector.
The VAT returns for the third quarter of 2005 contained only the amounts documented by the Czech tax inspector and referred to invoices invoiced after the first May 2004.
The BRH found that, on the basis of a reply from the Czech tax administration, the local FA concluded that these sales were a uniform (goods) delivery of the Czech tax liabilities to the German taxpayer, including the assembly carried out.
In this particular case, the place of fulfilment of this so-called factory delivery is the place where the production plant is assembled.
The German recipient of the delivery of the goods owes the value added tax in accordance with the German VAT Act.
At the same time, the recipient may claim a deduction of the same amount.
As the VAT liability of the German taxable person remained unchanged, the German FA did not correct the VAT declaration.
13. According to the MIAS data, the Czech tax preparer A purchased a machine worth €58,000 from the German tax preparer C in February 2005.
The Czech finance official sent a request for verification of this information to Germany.
In response to the request for information, the German side announced that the German tax preparer C had delivered this machine to the Czech tax preparer B in 2004, but that he had returned it to the German tax preparer C in October 2004.
According to the German tax administration, the aircraft was not transported back to Germany, but to the branch office of the German tax company C in the Czech Republic.
From the reply to the request for information it also emerged that the German tax preparer C had delivered the machine to the Czech tax preparer A in February 2005.
He received the machine at the registered office of the German tax inspector in the Czech Republic.
As this delivery (from C to A) took place only within the Czech Republic, there was no joint delivery of goods.
By means of a request to the local tax official responsible for the tax plane B, the NKÚ found that according to the MIAS data, the German tax plane C had delivered goods (another machine) worth €88,027 to the Czech tax plane in the third quarter of 2004.
The tax inspector B stated that he had not received the goods, so the local Czech tax official sent a request for information to Germany.
The answer was that the machine had been delivered.
In the course of further investigations at Tax Plant B, the tax official found that the machine, worth €88,027, had not been accounted for by Tax Plant B and that it could be the same type of machine as had been delivered to Czech Tax Plant A by the branch of German Tax Plant C in February 2005.
The NKÚ also noted that the Czech tax official responsible for the tax lien A had carried out an audit of the case.
The tax official had the invoice of the German tax plane C dated February 7, 2005, in which the tax plane A is specified as the recipient of the machine.
The Czech tax official found that the taxable entity A had not accounted for this invoice.
Tax controller A had concluded a lease agreement with another Czech company, the object of which was a machine of the same type.
The leasing company ﬁrma delivered the machine on February 9, 2005 and also provided transport.
The Czech FA did not use the information provided in the reply to the request for information for the determination of the tax liability of the taxable entity A.
The BRH found that the German tax controller C had not delivered the machine worth €88,027 to the Czech Republic, but to another German tax preparer D.
Accordingly, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods, but a taxable delivery within Germany.
Consequently, the German tax official did not recognize the claim of the German tax-efficient C to VAT exemption and corrected the information in his tax return.
The German control plane operator D delivered the machine to the Czech control plane B.
According to German law, this delivery was not subject to tax in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.
The BRH also noted that in its ZM for the first quarter of 2005, the German tax preparer C had indicated the delivery of a machine worth €58,000 to the Czech tax preparer A.
This delivery was not verified during the German FA tax audit.
The following illustration shows the contractual relations between the business partners involved in the above-mentioned transactions.
14.
In examining requests for information received, NKÚ found that on 4 October 2005 the Czech tax administration had received a request for information from Germany in which a German tax official requested the verification of intra-Community deliveries of a German tax asset worth €879.680.625 to a Czech tax entity.
The German finance official stated that there was a suspicion that this was a fictitious intra-Community supply of goods.
The German tax preparer had not engaged in any active business activity since 1999.
The NKÚ found that the Czech tax official had carried out an external audit of the Czech tax inspector.
The head of the Czech company stated that this was probably a claim of the German tax inspector against the German tax administration, which the Czech tax inspector, as a shareholder in the German company, had lodged with the German FA.
According to the information given to NKÚ, the Czech tax official has so far received no information that the German tax administration is handling the case with regard to the Czech tax case.
From the information available, it is clear that this was not a delivery of goods; nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored in the MIAS as an intra-Community delivery of goods from Germany to a Czech tax collector.
The main reason for these discrepancies was the failure to state the intra-Community acquisition in the tax returns of the beneficiaries (see Section 4.4.1):
15. According to the MIAS data, in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005, a German tax preparer delivered goods to a Czech tax preparer with a total value of €33,205.
However, the Czech tax inspector did not declare the intra-Community acquisition.
In the context of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech tax official requested an examination of the delivery of goods from Germany.
In its reply to this request for information, the German side stated that the German tax inspector had sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech tax inspector and that he had personally collected the remaining goods.
By means of a request to the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax inspector had issued a supplementary VAT declaration for the period in question before receiving a reply to the request for information.
Nevertheless, the differences regarding the value of the acquisitions could not be resolved, so the Czech tax official recommended a tax audit of the Czech tax authorities.
This examination has not yet been carried out.
16. According to the MIAS data, a German tax preparer had delivered goods worth €46,854 to a Czech tax preparer in the third quarter of 2004.
For the same period, a Czech tax inspector declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only €14,856.
In the context of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech finance official asked for verification of the actual value of the delivery.
With the German answer to this request, three invoices were sent which showed a total value of the delivered goods of €31,999, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech tax authorities and the MIAS data.
By means of a request to the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ found that after receiving the reply from Germany, he had contacted the accountant of the Czech Tax Office and stayed with her in such a way that, after checking the invoices, she and the company owner wanted to discuss the issue of a supplementary VAT declaration for the third quarter of 2004.
So far, no supplementary VAT declaration has been issued.
The Czech tax official informed NKÚ that he would proceed in such a way that the deadlines for retroactive VAT fixing for the relevant tax period would be respected.
17.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German tax authorities delivered goods worth €11,600 to the German tax authorities.
In the context of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the German tax official asked for verification whether the so-called Czech tax fugitive actually existed, since the alleged capital owner of the German tax fugitive had established a number of phantom ﬁrms in Germany.
In the course of the FA's review of the transaction, the Czech tax inspector confirmed the purchase of the goods.
According to the Czech tax authorities, however, the goods were not delivered from Germany to the Czech Republic, but were resold in Germany in 2005.
The Czech tax inspector presented evidence of the sale in January 2005.
The Czech taxable person was not registered in Germany as subject to turnover tax and had not taxed the sale of the goods in question either in the Czech Republic or in Germany.
All these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany and the Czech tax official sent this information to the German tax administration in his reply to the request for information.
By means of a request to the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax inspector had issued a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004, in which he, among other things, declared the value of the goods he had acquired from a German tax collector and, at the same time, asserted the right of deduction for the purchase from other Member States.
In his Czech VAT declaration he declared no VAT on the sale of goods in Germany.
On the basis of a supplementary VAT declaration issued after the external audit, the Czech tax official fixed the VAT debt unchanged.
According to Czech legislation, in this case there was no acquisition of goods from other Member States, as the goods were not shipped or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.
Thus, the Czech finance official drew the wrong conclusion in the external audit.
The BRH found that immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information, which showed that the goods had not left Germany, the German tax official corrected the tax return of the German tax authority and demanded the payment of €1,600 in VAT.
In addition, the competent FA sent a control communication to the FA responsible for the actual recipient of the goods to ensure that the resale of these goods is properly taxed.
In the following cases, operators declared intra-Community deliveries which may not have been carried out:
18.
The Czech tax official received a request for information from the German tax administration on the question of whether the Czech tax inspector had purchased a car worth €47,400 from the German tax inspector in February 2005.
The request for information was accompanied by a copy of the VAT registration certificate of the Czech tax inspector.
A photocopy of the passport of the person who was supposed to have transferred the vehicle was also included.
In the course of his investigation, the Czech tax official found that the passport had been stolen, that the person named in it had not imported a vehicle into the Czech Republic, and that he had no contacts with a German tax collector.
The VAT registration certificate, the imprint of which had been sent by the German side, had not been issued by the Czech tax administration.
With this information the Czech tax official answered the request for information and at the same time stated that he could not confirm the purchase of the car.
By means of a request to the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ established that the Czech tax office is not located at the address indicated in the commercial register and that the managing director of the company is unreachable.
After a tax appeal procedure for the February 2005 tax period, the Czech tax official fixed the tax liability of the Czech tax lien at zero.
In the course of a further investigation, the Czech finance official found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had purchased it on the basis of an Internet advertisement.
The BRH found that the local competent German tax official had rejected the claim of the German tax inspector for exemption from the VAT on the basis of the Czech response to the request for information.
19. In the course of an external audit, a German FA was unable to clarify a difference of €3,000 between the value of the goods purchased in the VAT declaration and the reported values from other Member States.
In the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, a Czech tax preparer was supposed to have delivered goods worth €89,424 to a German tax preparer.
As the acquisition declared by the German tax authorities did not correspond to the MIAS data, the German tax official requested the verification of the supplies and payment of the supplies within the framework of the interstate exchange of information.
In his reply to the request for information, the Czech tax official stated that the only managing director of the Czech company had been deleted from the commercial register on 8 July 2005 and that a new managing director had not yet been registered.
The German recipient of the goods was presumably a relative of the shareholder of the Czech company.
The Czech tax inspector issued a VAT declaration and a ZM, which had been signed by an unauthorised person, namely that shareholder of the company, after the deletion of the managing director in the commercial register.
The accountant of the Czech tax office informed the tax official that the capital owner had deposited the payment received for the goods in euros into the company's account.
Cash receipts were not issued.
By request to the local Czech FA, the NKÚ found that the tax official had recognised the Czech tax authority's claim for VAT exemption on goods delivered to other Member States worth CZK 1.326.307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1.416.180 in the first quarter of 2005.
The BRH found that the German tax official did not correct the VAT declaration of the German acquirer, as a German court had meanwhile confirmed the insolvency of the German tax litigant.
As the previous external audit had shown no evidence of tax fraud, there was no prospect of being able to collect a fixed VAT liability.
20. According to the MIAS data, a German taxpayer purchased goods from the Czech Republic worth €4,251,196 in 2005, after which he purchased goods worth €43,274 the previous year.
The German tax authority did not declare the intra-Community acquisitions in its 2004 VAT return or in the for 2005.
He also did not explain the value of the initial sales.
Due to these discrepancies, the German FA issued a request for information concerning the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006.
In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-Community shipments of goods with a total value of 167,246.083 CZK.
On 6 September 2006, the request for information was received, in which the German side requested to verify whether the delivery reported by the Czech tax inspector had actually taken place.
In response to this request for information, the Czech tax administration stated that the German request could not be complied with because the Czech company does not have a managing director (or other legal representative).
Documents provided to the NKÚ by the responsible tax official show that on 30 March 2006, together with the Managing Director of the Czech Tax Office, a protocol on the commencement of the VAT audit for the 4th quarter of 2004 and the period January to December 2005 was drawn up.
At the same time, the tax inspector was asked by the tax officer to submit all accounting and tax documents for this period, but failed to do so.
According to the Commercial Register, the term of office of the sole Managing Director expired on 16 May 2005 without a new Managing Director being appointed.
Since April 2006, the Czech tax preparer has not filed any sales tax returns.
In the context of the parallel investigation, NKÚ, in cooperation with BRH, investigated several cases of intra-Community supplies between the Czech Republic and Germany which were not the subject of a previous exchange of information between the two countries.
The two Court of Auditors exchanged information on the cases examined through the CLO of both countries.
21. A Czech company (UCR) which is not domiciled in Germany informed the competent FA (Chemnitz-South) that it wanted to carry out taxable business in Germany.
Based on this information, the company was registered as of June 2005, but did not receive a German USt-IdNr.
The (UCR) accepted an order from a Danish company (UDK) for the manufacture of wind turbines and their delivery to Austria on behalf, at the risk and on behalf of the Danish customer.
Due to insufficient own production capacity, the Danish company passed on part of the contract to a German tax preparer (UDE) based in Germany.
The following diagram shows the contractual relations and the transport route of the wind turbines:
According to German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:
- The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines to Austria for installation on its behalf, at its own risk and on its own account.
Due to the installation, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the delivery of the wind turbines is controllable in Austria.
- Because the freight forwarder was commissioned by the Danish company (UDK) and the latter had the transport carried out on his own behalf, at his own risk and for his own account, the place of delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE) is where the transport began, i.e. in Germany.
Although the wind turbines were supplied to another EC Member State (AU) and the recipient is registered as a taxable entity in an EC Member State (CR), no exemption could be claimed for the delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE), since the EC Member State for which the delivery was intended is different from the country of residence of the Czech company 19.
Accordingly, the delivery is duly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the deduction in its VAT returns.
The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) is also based on the place where the transport started.
However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.
- The supply of wind turbines manufactured in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
- The supply of the other wind turbines manufactured in Germany took place in Germany.
Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) supplied both intra-Community supplies from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-Community supplies from Germany to Austria.
The BRH found that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare intra-Community supplies in its German tax returns or in its customs declarations to the German CLO.
Consequently, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-Community supplies in the same way as intra-Community supplies from the Czech Republic.
The NCP found that (UCR) had not notified intra-Community supplies to Austria, but intra-Community supplies to Denmark.
In order to ensure the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria, cooperation between at least four financial administrations (the Austrian, Czech, Danish and German) would be required, although in this case there is no evidence of tax fraud or tax evasion.
In addition, the NKÚ and the BRH examined case designs to show the size of the differences between the VAT declarations and the MIAS data caused by the different legislation in 2004.
The cases examined also show that it takes some time for the tax authorities and the FÄ to apply the new legal provisions:
22. In its ZM for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004, a Czech tax preparer reported shipments of goods with a total value of 792.977.452 CZK to a German tax preparer.
In the same period, another Czech tax preparer reported in his ZM intra-Community deliveries to another German tax preparer with a total value of 18,157.265 CZK.
The information provided by the BRH to NKÚ showed that both cases involved electricity supplies.
Both Czech tax authorities took into account the above-mentioned deliveries in their customs documents in accordance with Czech law No. 235 / 2004, which was in force in 2004.
In a further examination of these transactions, an audit group of NKÚ found that in 2004 different legal provisions on the supply and acquisition of electricity between the Czech Republic and Germany applied.
Whereas in the Czech Republic the tax authorities declared the supplies of electrical energy to be intra-Community supplies in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 235 / 2004 in force in 2004, according to the German legal provisions in force in 2004, these were not intra-Community purchases of goods, but taxable and taxable transactions in Germany.
The differences in the legal provisions were eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Law Nr. 635 / 2004, which changed some tax provisions as of 1 January 2005.
23. During the examination of intra-Community supplies and acquisitions in cooperation with the BRH, it was further established that a Czech tax preparer declared intra-Community deliveries in his ZM for the first and fourth quarters of 2005 to a German tax litigant with a total value of 240.411.163 CZK and another Czech tax litigant declared intra-Community deliveries in his ZM for the same period to another German tax litigant worth 263.470.776 CZK.
Information provided by the BRH to the NKÚ showed that both cases concerned supplies of electrical energy.
In accordance with the wording of Law No 235 / 2004 applicable from 1 January 2005, the place of performance for the supply of electrical energy shall be the place where the acquirer has its legal domicile, registered office or place of business for which this delivery is made.
Therefore, the Czech tax authorities should not have specified the electricity supply in their 2005 SDGs.
The fact that both control faculties treated the supply of electrical energy in their ZM as intra-Community supplies led to a material difference of 503.881.939 CZK in MIAS.
Final note:
The cooperation has achieved the objectives of the BRH and the NKÚ.
Both Court of Auditors gained in-depth knowledge of the VAT administration systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The cooperation revealed differences in the two systems and in the legal provisions governing VAT administration.
During the parallel tests, interesting cases of intra-Community supplies and acquisitions came to light.
Some of these are worth further observation.
On the basis of the results of the audit, both Court of Auditors drew up recommendations on the management of VAT.
The follow-up of these recommendations in the form of a control review should be part of the follow-up.
The new experience and knowledge gained through cooperation between the two Court of Auditors is the basis for the successful implementation of future audits in the field of VAT administration.

Rocknacht in der Schuhfabrik: Volume at pneumatic hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and ignite a concert evening with the power of a tiger." The band names of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" alone suggest such a description of the rocking live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: pure hard rock by three bands friends.

This is at the level of pneumatic hammer, for example, but is still significantly below the controls of the "Wacken Fesitval," to which "The Ignition" refer on their website.

Trump adores Kim: "And then we fell in love"

Laschet calls for the rule of law in Turkey

Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington to be accommodating.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, has accused the US government in the UN General Debate of using its continuing sanctions to block negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
"The recent stalemate comes as the US is relying on coercive measures that are fatal to confidence-building," Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea in these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," said the North Korean chief diplomat.
That punitive measures could "bring North Korea to its knees" is "a pipe dream of people who do not know us."

Despite the criticism of his person after the end of the World Cup and the Özil affair, he intends to run for the office of DFB President again next year.

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be removed only with express consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes will then be available from Swisstransplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be removed - as in Germany - only with express consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, Director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of the cases a card is found at the decisive moment with possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the wish of the deceased.
"They then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," says Immer.
A similar registration system already exists in Great Britain.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman of the Federal Agency for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert, says.
"There is no register in which people can register their wishes - for or against organ donation," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken out in favour of a new regulation on organ donation.
Under his proposal, anyone would initially be considered an organ donor unless they or relatives object.

It requires a high level of organisational, technical and financial effort.
When building and developing a sustainable European transport infrastructure, difficult compromises often have to be made with European and national policy objectives, such as the preservation of the environment.
It is precisely because of the necessary environmental protection measures that the construction of the transport infrastructure is burdensome.
When planning and awarding the construction of transport routes, administrations can save considerable financial resources and use them for other useful purposes through careful action and decision-making.
One of the tasks of public auditing authorities is to identify shortcomings that are at odds with the optimum level of economy, efficiency and effectiveness of spending on the construction of transport facilities.
The auditing authorities should not only draw the attention of the administrations to the shortcomings that have been identified, but should also make proposals for improvements for the benefit of the citizens and for the benefit of Europe.
A summary of the report
In 2005 and 2006, the two Supreme Audit Institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic, the Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) and the Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad (NKÚ), carried out parallel audits of expenditure for the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway (highway D 8 in the Czech Republic and highway A 17 in the Federal Republic of Germany).
The two motorways are connected by a border bridge jointly financed by both states.
Cooperation with NKÚ enabled BRH to carry out an in-depth assessment of the economic viability of the use of funds for the construction of the border bridge.
In cooperation with the BRH, NKÚ obtained data from German bridges and tunnels for its own cost comparisons.
In 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany concluded a contract for the construction of the border bridge.
In line with the progress of the planning process, the date of completion was finally fixed at the end of 2006.
However, during the award procedure, errors were made by the Road and Motorway Directorate of the Czech Republic (RMD) which delayed the procedure and shortened the available construction time.
The contract with the contractor was therefore concluded later than planned.
The contractor secured the accelerated construction of the bridge until the end of 2006.
For this, however, the RMD had to accept considerable additional costs.
As part of the joint audit work, the prices of motorway bridges on D 8 and A 17 were compared. The benchmark for the price comparison of bridges was the size of the bridge area.
A price analysis using statistical methods identified bridges with high costs per square metre.
The analysis showed that the border bridge was the most expensive of the large bridges with lengths of more than 100 m.
This was also due to the increase in prices as a result of the delays in awarding contracts.
The comparison of the prices of the tunnels showed that the prices of the tunnels in the course of the D 8 are significantly higher than the prices of comparable tunnels in Germany.
Both BRH and NKÚ will be able to rely on a collection of data on bridge and tunnel prices for future tests on the economic viability of spending on transport infrastructure.
Both Court of Auditors recommend that bridge constructions should be standardised and that steel composite and special constructions should only be carried out where tensioned concrete constructions are not fit for purpose.
The course of the examination was characterised by teamwork and an open approach.
During the parallel examination, the examiners from both sides exchanged their expertise and skills.
Introduction: Introduction
The subject of this report are the parallel audits of expenditure on the construction of the motorway from Dresden to Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).
The focus of the audit was on economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of funds.
The parallel tests were carried out by BRH in Germany and NKÚ in the Czech Republic
In 2005 and 2006, the company undertook a series of acquisitions and acquisitions.
The NKÚ examined the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the expenditure for the border section 0807 of the D 8 motorway in the amount of approximately CZK 20 billion gross (approx. €690 million).
Of this amount, €64 million will come from the EU Structural Funds (ISPA).
The BRH had already tested the design and construction of the A17 motorway between 2003 and 2005, independent of the parallel tests carried out with the NKÚ.
The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) will co-finance €277 million of the funding for the construction of all three sections of A 17 of approx. €670 million.
The Prague-Dresden motorway is part of the Pan-European Transport Corridor IV Dresden - Central and Southeastern Europe - Istanbul.
The D 8 runs from Prague via Usti nad Labem to the Czech / German border,
A 17 from the border to Dresden.
At the time of the test, the cross-border sections of the motorways were under construction.
Both sections were opened to traffic on 21 December 2006.
While the motorway is thus completed on the German side to Dresden, the D 8 on the Czech side remains incomplete, as the section 0805 over a length of 16.4 km between Rehlovice and Lovosice is still in the planning phase.
The crossing of a protected landscape area in the Czech Central Mountains is planned here.
According to Czech forecasts dating back to 2001, traffic on the border section 0807 of the D 8 motorway will reach 22 940 vehicles per day in 2008.
German forecasts estimate the traffic volume on the A17 at the Czech border in 2010 at about 25 000 vehicles per day.
In 2000, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic concluded a contract for the merger of the German motorway A 17 and the Czech motorway D 8 at the common state border through the construction of a border bridge.
As both states are involved in the construction of this bridge, this single construction project was an important aspect of the parallel audits carried out by both Court of Auditors.
Cooperation between BRH and NKÚ
As of mid-2005, the two Court of Auditors issued joint reflections on cooperation in the examination of the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway.
Both sides had important reasons for this cooperation:
1 overall pick in the draft.
Germany partly finances the construction of the border bridge.
Planning and construction are the responsibility of the Czech Road Administration.
There was no possibility for the BRH to examine this construction project itself.
2.
The NKÚ did not have any comparative data to assess whether the funds were used sparingly with regard to the total construction costs of the bridges and tunnels on the D 8.
3.
The NKÚ also had to examine the effectiveness of the expenditure by examining the essential technical parameters of the bridges and tunnels, which should ensure the same quality of use on both sides of the border.
On 4 January 2006, following preparatory negotiations, the Presidents of the two Court of Auditors concluded an agreement on the coordination of checks on the Prague-Dresden motorway.
The auditors of both Court of Auditors met at intervals of approximately six to eight weeks in the course of 2006.
They discussed current problems and tasks. They developed a uniform methodology for the examination of bridge and tunnel prices, exchanged test results on the construction of the border bridge and produced joint reports.
A key element of the cooperation was the ongoing exchange of information.
While the BRH focused mainly on the comparison of the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels as well as the procurement procedures, the NKÚ mainly developed the methodology for the analysis of bridge and tunnel prices.
In Germany and the Czech Republic, the legal basis for financial control differs and so does the way in which the two Court of Auditors complete their audits.
For this reason, both authorities drew up separate national reports on their audit results.
This report takes account of the results of the two parallel audits.
The cooperation will end with the signing of a Final Communiqué in the first half of 2007.
Construction of the border bridge
In the Treaty of 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed to complete the border bridge, if possible, in 2005.
They later consensually postponed the date until the end of 2006.
The RMD acted as the client of the construction project.
Germany contributes 42.13% of the financing of bridge construction.
First of all, the RMD provided for a tensioned concrete construction for the border bridge.
However, in 1999 RMD and its German partner agreed on the construction of a steel composite structure.
They justified this decision on the grounds that it would reduce the number of pairs of pillars from seven to five and that it would bring environmental benefits to the Talaue.
In addition, a comparative calculation of the RMD had shown the steel composite construction to be the most cost-effective solution.
However, this was due to a calculation error.
The calculation was based on a length of the new steel composite structure of only 397 m,
But it's actually 5% longer.
During the award procedure, the RMD made serious errors,
by insufficiently preparing the procurement documents and describing both evaluation and sub-criteria inaccurately.
These errors led to subjective and ambiguous assessments by the Assessment Commission and the Director General of the RMD.
A losing bidder challenged the outcome of the tendering procedure.
The ensuing investigation by the Czech cartel office delayed the signing of the construction contract for the border bridge.
As a result, the summer construction season following the tender examination was lost in 2004 and the total construction time available was reduced.
The contractor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter period of time, leading to a significant price increase.
Among the measures offered were the double assembly of the superstructures, the modification of the pillar shape and the erection of an assembly hall.
In addition, the contractor was unable to procure the original type of steel.
The new type of steel - whose higher cost of approx. €4 million was borne by the client alone - made it possible to shorten the construction time for corrosion protection and thus the overall construction time.
Compared to the offer price of approx. €18.3 million net, the acceleration measures and further additions will substantially increase the total construction costs of the border bridge.
The shortened construction time alone led to a price increase of about €5.9 million.
The costs are currently around €25.9 million net (as at October 2006), excluding price guidance.
Comparison of the prices of bridges and tunnels
Both Court of Auditors examined the bridge prices on D 8 and A 17 in order to identify the bridges which were characterised by particularly high prices and to compare the bridge prices on the German and Czech sides.
The study was based on mathematical statistical methods.
The tunnels on the D 8 were compared with similar tunnels on the German motorways A 71, A 38 and A 4, as there were no comparable tunnels on the A 17.
In preparing this part of the test, a precise definition of the concept of price was important.
For the comparison of bridge prices, both Court of Auditors agreed on detailed specifications, such as the use of the current price paid for the bridge without VAT.
(The VAT rates in the Czech Republic and Germany are different and may change), not to take into account the costs of special founding measures, to use for currency conversion the rate of the European Central Bank of 30 December 2005. (29 CZK = 1 €).
Bridges of different types (reinforced concrete, reinforced concrete, steel composite and steel) and different sizes are available on both the D 8 and the A 17.
In order to ensure comparability of the tested bridge constructions, the bridges were grouped according to their type of construction.
The analyses also took into account the bridge size within these groups.
By far the most frequent were concrete bridges on both sides of the border (20 bridges on the D 8 and 36 bridges on the A 17).
The study focused on this type of bridge, as the size of the sample allowed the use of mathematical statistical methods and improved the reliability of the results.
The investigation showed that the m ² price of the concrete bridges on the D 8 / A 17 depends on the size of the bridge (length, lane area): the larger the bridge, the smaller the square metre price.
For German bridges, the correlation between price and size is more pronounced than for Czech bridges (see pictures below).
Two bridges were found on the A 17 and four bridges on the D 8 with significantly higher prices.
These bridges were determined partly by a method of identifying significant deviations within a sample and partly by regression analysis of the correlation between bridge price and size (atypically expensive bridges can be identified on the basis of the distance to the regression curve).
However, the atypically high price of these bridges should only serve as an indication of which bridges to focus on.
In order to draw definitive conclusions, the causes of the respective high price have to be determined on a case-by-case basis.
This could be due, for example, to uneconomic administrative transactions, but also to the requirements for the protection of the environment or other justified reasons.
Taking into account the larger average length of Czech concrete bridges compared to the German ones (see table 1), the proven negative correlation between the bridge price and the length suggested that Czech concrete bridges are cheaper.
This was also supported by lower labour costs in the Czech Republic compared to Germany.
However, the evaluation of the results showed that the price of the concrete bridges on the D 8 is higher than on the A 17.
Two causes of this situation were identified in joint meetings:
1 overall pick in the draft.
In Germany, construction contracts for bridges are mostly awarded separately.
This also enables medium-sized enterprises to participate in the award competition.
In the Czech Republic, many bridge construction contracts are awarded as part of larger contracts for the construction of several kilometres of motorway sections.
Orders of this magnitude are not manageable by medium-sized enterprises.
2.
In the Czech Republic, the variety of bridge constructions built is greater than in Germany.
In this context, the NKÚ noted that the construction of bridges will be fixed long before the start of construction,
and already at the time of the submission of the planning application by the RMD.
At this stage, it is choosing from a number of alternatives a specific bridge construction variant. However, economic efficiency plays a minor role in this decision.
Only a thorough analysis of the two countries' construction sectors would have enabled a final conclusion to be reached with regard to bridge prices in the Czech Republic and Germany, but this would have blown up the scope of this examination.
The border bridge is the most expensive steel composite bridge on the D 8 and A 17.
The prices for the tunnels on the D 8 are about twice as high as in Germany.
However, a comparison of the technical parameters between the tunnels at the D 8 and the tunnels in Germany showed no significant difference.
The significant price differences may be the result of an underdeveloped competition for tunnel construction in the Czech Republic.
However, the small number of tunnels did not allow for generalizing conclusions.
Economic efficiency and effectiveness of the Dresden-Prague motorway
The independent Czech Republic was founded in 1993.
In the same year, the government adopted the plan for the development of the motorway network.
The plan was to gradually expand the D 8 from Prague to the national border with Germany.
The section 0805 through the Bohemian Central Mountains was to be built in front of the border section 0807.
The Czech Republic finances D 8 under the Programme Financing.
The programme number 327 220 "Construction of the highway D 8 Prague - Ústí nad Labem - Czech-German border" defines two objectives:
1 overall pick in the draft.
as a national objective: to improve the connection between Prague and Ústi nad Labem;
2.
as an international destination: the connection between Prague and Berlin as part of the Pan-European Corridor IV BerlinIstanbul.
The programme planned to complete the construction of the section leading through the Czech Central Mountains in June 2008 and the construction of section 0807 near the border in June 2007.
It should be noted that the end of the construction work is not identical to the date of commissioning.
The NKÚ noted that the planning decision had already been adopted for the construction of the section leading through the Czech Central Mountains.
Environmental groups have complained against this decision.
A final judgment has yet to be delivered.
Therefore, compared to the timetable provided for in the programme documentation, a delay of several years in the completion of section No 0805 could not be ruled out.
In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed to postpone the completion date of construction section No. 0805 until 2010.
As a result, the construction of the border section did not achieve the national objective of improving the connection between Prague and Usti nad Labem.
The RMD carried out an economic assessment of the section No. 0807 of the D 8 and section No. 0805 of the Czech Central Mountains, which are close to the border, between 1999 and 2001.
As an investment cost, it invested approximately €639 million for both sections Nr. 0805 and Nr. 0807.
Table 2: Results of the Economical Assessment (EIRR = Internal Interest Rate Base)
Variant opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8sections in 2007.
Traffic volume in the northern part of the border section 18 000 vehicles per day in 2010.
Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8sections in 2007.
Traffic volume in the northern part of the border section 22 000 vehicles per day in 2010.
Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8sections in 2007.
Traffic volume in the northern part of the border section 25 000 vehicles per day in 2010.
The 2001 economic feasibility study was based on the assumption that the section that crosses the border and the section that passes through the Bohemian Central Mountains would go under traffic at the same time.
At the time of the test it was obvious that the section through the Bohemian Central Mountains will not be opened on the original date.
This reduces the above EIRR values.
The costs of both sections amounted to €897 million excluding VAT as of 31 December 2005, which was 27.4% higher than in the 2001 economic perspective.
In addition, there is a risk that Section 0805 will have a different, more burdensome course of action, which would affect the economic viability of the project.
The economic analysis showed that the construction of both motorway sections with a daily traffic volume of at least 18 000 vehicles per day in 2010 is economically justified. The forecast for 2008 had predicted 22 940 vehicles per day.
However, a study of diversion routes as an alternative to the missing section through the Bohemian Mid-Mountain is based on a traffic volume of 12 600 to 13 750 vehicles per day in 2007. The project is then below the economic limit.
Increased traffic on the routes to replace the missing section through the Czech Central Mountains is likely to result in congestion and thus increased external costs, which were not taken into account in the original economic analysis.
The mentioned reduction in revenue and increase in costs means that the already low EIRR for the construction of the borderline section of the D 8 will not be achieved.
The construction of the bordering section of the D 8 is therefore uneconomic.
The cost of the construction of the A 17 also increased, as did the construction of the two above-mentioned sections of the D 8.
In the context of the general economic assessment for the Federal Transport Plan 1992, the Federal Ministry responsible for Transport assumed investment costs of approx. €320 million.
Thus it determined a benefit / cost ratio of 4.6.
In the meantime, the costs have increased to around €670 million and the benefit / cost ratio has been reduced by more than half.
The BRH independently of the parallel tests with the NKÚ in the years 2003 to 2005 had examined the economic viability of the planning and construction of the motorway A 17.
It found that the authorisation authority requested a non-necessary landscape tunnel for the third section of the A17.
In the course of the examination, the BRH succeeded in convincing the Federal Ministry and the Road Administration of the superfluousness of the landscape tunnel.
This avoided €10 million in construction costs and €150 000 in annual operating costs.
When examining the first section of A 17, the BRH found that the construction project was inadequately prepared.
The following example illustrates this:
During the planning phase, the road building administration refrained from recording the condition of the rock on the surface of the Dölzschener Wall, as it was difficult to access it.
Only when the tunnel drive reached the wall did it catch up.
It turned out that the rock had weathered more strongly than was assumed at the time of the tender.
Extensive measures such as anchorages, injections and stone impact protection nets for around €3.3 million became necessary.
The road construction administration was responsible not only for the costs of additional services that were already required, such as securing the Dölzschener Wall, but also for those that would not have been necessary if the construction had been properly prepared.
These include expenditure due to disrupted construction processes (€3.2 million), additional training of the sales team (€0.5 million) and increased wages and material prices due to the extension of the construction time (€7 million).
This additional expenditure of around €10.7 million does not represent any lasting added value.
The BRH took these and other measures as an opportunity to call on the Federal Ministry to better exercise its responsibility for the technical supervision of major road construction measures.
In this context, it should insist that the road authorities introduce quality assurance systems.
Benefits of cooperation for BRH and NKÚ The cooperation met the expectations of both Court of Auditors.
The BRH received information on the planning, procurement and implementation of the construction of the border bridge.
Both Court of Auditors have developed a database of bridge and tunnel prices which will be useful in future audits.
The NKÚ found that the most important structural parameters for bridges, tunnels and carriageways of the D 8 did not differ from those of the A 17.
The auditors of both Court of Auditors involved in the cooperation gained valuable experience which will be useful in future audits.

FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You felt the fear
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first victory of the season against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first victory of the season.
Nevertheless, the time factor also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
That was no different in the home match against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in there.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty area, "said the sports director of Schalke 04 - and breathed a sigh of relief.
After all, the royal blue had managed to wrap up the close 1-0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first victory of the season.
In fact, things could have turned out differently.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11 had given the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco security: "Overall, the first half was good, both playfully and in terms of pressing," obviously more and more the head played a role with increasing playing time.
Schöpf actually no head-ball monster
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours for me," said Heidel: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore withdrew further and further.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three points of the season.
"We all fell a huge stone from our hearts," said Schöpf, who played no insignificant part in this with his head ball hit: "I am actually the worst head ball player in the team."
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start powerfully in the initial phase and make fireworks out of it," said Schalke's head coach.
The victory was important.
Finally we can look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: Königsblau missed to worry about clearer conditions.
The possibilities were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who hit the bar twice 59th / 72nd or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it would not have been a trembling victory," said Tedesco: "You have already felt the fear a little."
I am therefore pleased that we have won.
