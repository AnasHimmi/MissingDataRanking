DFB chief Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB president Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil's return to the national team.
"This is a question that of course depends on the fact that you get into a conversation, that you also talk to him about why he obviously felt one way or the other, as stated in his statement," Grindel said in the football podcast "Phrasenmower" of the "Bild-Zeitung.
Despite months of debate over Özil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he said he regretted the resignation of the 92-time international Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed up to a point that this would be the case, "Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had announced his retirement from the DFB team in July, citing the fact that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB chief repeated his criticism of Özil for not being ready for a conversation with national coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He said he didn't want to build pressure, but he knows from football that when "you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it's a shame that that conversation hasn't come to fruition."

Mainz (AP) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run for president of the German Football Association (DFB) again next year, despite criticism of him following the World Cup exit and the Özil affair.

Decided to return from the Ethnological Museum to Native People in Alaska
The Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation (SPK) will return nine objects from the collection of the Ethnological Museum of the State Museums in Berlin to the Chugach Alaska Corporation.
The Board of Trustees today approved a proposal to this effect from the President.
The objects are burial objects of Native people from southwest Alaska.
They were among the objects brought to Berlin by Johan Adrian Jacobsen, who travelled the American north-west coast and Alaska between 1882 and 1884 on behalf of what was then the Royal Museum of Ethnology (now the Ethnological Museum).
Hermann Parzinger, President of the SPK, said:
"The objects were taken at that time without the consent of the Native People and thus unlawfully from the graves of their deceased, so they do not belong in our museums."
"We will now return you to the Chugach Alaska Corporation, with whom we have been working on the refurbishment of our collection since 2015."
The restituted objects will be presented in the future in the Chugach community, among other things as part of the annual Chugach Spirit Camp, which serves the exchange of knowledge between the generations and the various tribes that today count themselves among the Chugach.
In the context of John Johnson's current visit to Berlin, a memorandum of understanding with the Ethnological Museum was also prepared.
The objects are burial objects from Chenega Island and the now unknown village of Sanradna in Kachemak Bay.
Among them are two broken masks and a cradle, as well as a wooden idol.
Masks were usually burned or placed in graves after use, which is why there are not many masks of the Chugach today.
The red color on them refers to the funeral context.
The wooden idol is probably a shamanic figure who was supposed to protect people from danger and death.
In total, the Ethnological Museum owns just over 200 objects of the Chugach.
The Chugach region in southwest Alaska has been inhabited for several thousand years by people who call themselves Sugpiaq or Alutiiq and were formerly also called Pacific Eskimos.
About 1,000 to 1,500 years ago, Athabascan-speaking Indian groups also migrated, the present-day Dena'ina (formerly called Tanaina).
Today, the Alaskan Natives, who call themselves Chugach, live around Prince William Sound and Cook Inlet.
They live in seven communities: Chenega, Eyak, Nanwalek, Port Graham, Seward, Tatilek and Valdez.
Regular contacts with Europe have existed since the time of Tsar Peter the Great.
In November 2015, a delegation from the Chugach Alaska Corporation visited the Ethnological Museum with the aim of initiating cooperation for future projects.
The background was, among other things, the interest in creating a virtual collection of all Chugach objects worldwide.
Subsequently, the Corporation asked the Ethnological Museum for assistance in the repatriation of any existing grave goods from the region.
The Chugach Alaska Corporation (www.chugach-ak.com) has been representing the interests of the Native People of the Chugach Region of Alaska since 1972.
Among other things, it is committed to the preservation of the cultural heritage of these groups.
The US government supported the return request by means of a diplomatic note.
In accordance with its basic attitude to dealing with its non-European collections and the study of provenances, the SPK carefully examined the context in which the grave goods that are in the Ethnological Museum come from.
In the present case, all indications are that the objects came from a grave plunder and not from an approved archaeological dig.
From the travel diaries of Adrian Jacobsen it is clear that the graves were only opened for the purpose of extracting their contents.
There were no official or state permits for this, nor was the consent of the community of origin documented.
It was against this background that the decision was taken to return it.
Johan Adrian Jacobsen travelled the American northwest coast and Alaska at the end of the 19th century for the Museum of Ethnology in Berlin.
The director of the museum, Adolf Bastian, had commissioned him to collect objects as "original" as possible, uninfluenced by European culture, for the purpose of building up a collection.
Jacobsen brought about 3000 objects from the northwest coast and about 4000 objects from Alaska to Berlin.
His account of the journey is an impressive document of the times.

Treysa has to deal with vandalism and debris
The entrance to the 36-kilometre-long railway cycle path in Red Riding Hood Land in Treysa is difficult to find and littered.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are sought, but solutions are few and far between.
Shards, cigarette butts, garbage and debris, demolished bins and meanwhile dismantled signs - this is how the entrance with seating group to the bike path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the showpiece railway cycle path in the Red Riding Hood country a more than inglorious sight.
The topic has been occupying members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for some time, according to Ulrich Wüstenhagen, the city's cycling commissioner.
The issue had already been raised in the Cycling Advisory Board.
So far, there is no solution.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to the regular emptying of the waste bins and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities," Wüstenhagen says.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also brought the topic to the local advisory board.
It's not just the rubbish that drives cyclists and residents around - the seating area is a regular meeting place for partying at weekends.
Not only is it often loud, the banquets also destroy: posts are torn out of the ground, rubbish bins are demolished, signs are bent over, seating furniture is smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the proverbial drop in the ocean.
They are annoyed that the rest area on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting point for binge drinking.
"Along the entire cycle path, the focus is clearly on the Haaße hill," confirms the cycling commissioner, who is now also concerned about the new cycling centre in Ziegenhain, which will be opened today.
'If she suffers the same fate, it's going to be really expensive. '
Another idea, he said, is video surveillance on the hill: "Maybe that sets the threshold much higher for seizing public property.
This would, however, require a police patrol to pass by in a timely manner.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wishes to see the development of the Haaße Hill.
It needs to be made more attractive.
One can be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle path so far.
The tourism marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is of a very high quality compared to others in Germany, "says the ADFC members.

Music contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call for the music contest was a success, creatively and in cooperation.
"D is a song for Hiltrup," is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "music contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians."
A contest "with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family," as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family get-together with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven groups competed, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, an Albachtener who lived for a long time in Hiltrup, the nine from the "Hiltruper Sternfarben," three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, declared district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We haven't seen that in other parts of the city.
What did the copywriters see themselves associated with?
With the places the Hiltruper lake and the Marktallee were mentioned particularly frequently.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue "Kö von Hiltrup" in his hit-like song.
The Kulturbahnhof was also honoured.
Again and again, it was about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke animated the short breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about their work.
So it was learned from Humberg that he had actually studied chemistry, but now also teaches guitar.
Franke reported from the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann that he had recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the programme.
And Alvin Jasic, meanwhile, has put all sorts of things on YouTube.
"It's not about winning," Franke had said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper catering trade.
Still, there was something special for the judges "favorites - so that others could hear their songs, too.
An entire CD can be recorded by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup hit, which particularly impressed Franke with its musicality, and the "Lummerland pack": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two kindergarten teachers on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children performed again for the finale - and even without electronic support, they sounded "really good," as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury consisted of Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund, as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive had brought the event to life on the occasion of its ten-year anniversary.

The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each page there is a screen, in it four cards with keywords, which - the old trick with the red foil - can only be deciphered once you have put them in.
This ensures that the other side cannot read anything, even by mistake.
The cards then read, for example, from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2nd window.
3rd cube.
4. Fest. "
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
For it is not the terms that are to be guessed here, but codes.
Alternately, one player per team is the encrypter.
He gets a code card that perhaps says "3.4.2."
What is to be guessed in "Decrypto" is not the terms behind the secret foil, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: He should - in this order and in this example - describe the terms "dice," "fixed" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team, if possible, does not; because that wins the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
The encrypter thus notes down and reads aloud: "Throw" for the dice, "Lose" as opposed to Fest; here, of course, something like "Party" would also be possible and "Prague" because he paid attention at school and knows the lintel there.
So it goes on round by round, team by team.
You don't know the terms of the other side - but you can rhyme them better with every hint the encrypter gives there.
So the paraphrases should be as mysterious as possible, but not too crazy, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rule book.
The players probably have to study it quite a long time and in detail until they can finally play.

Football: District: Researcher appearance of VfL Wolbeck against SC Altenrheine is encouraging
There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch took a hard line with his own.
He gave himself sparse words, the coach of the football district league VfL Wolbeck, withdrew at first (inwardly), in order to reflect on the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
All history.
In the meantime it is running again around the Brandhoveweg.
Taufrischer proof is the 1: 1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine, in the past season only razor-thin past the promotion.
Yes, I am very happy with the performance.
'We've made the spaces tight and put pressure on the ball.
That was impressive, "Fetsch praised his boys and went to each and every one of them after the match to simply say" thank you "for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury to Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - Luca Rehberg came in for him - the 4-4-2 changed almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes was in the front line waiting for balls.
Wolbeck had a lot more play in the first period.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs before his retirement (17th), the replaced Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
It almost paid off when, in minute 41, the SCA struck twice in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer in front of the Wolbeck box - goalkeeper Damian Hallas proved to be a master of his trade.
After the break VfL cheekily took full control.
Thewes narrowly failed from 18 yards.
Schroer, too, was late on a Thewes delivery after 58 minutes.
With the substitution of Miles Geske, Fetsch once again gave the left side a fresh start.
When Altenrhein's Chris Naberbäumer felled Robin Westhues in the 70th minute, there was an indirect free kick for the hosts 18 yards out.
The fouled man stepped up himself and demonstrated his danger to standards.
Westhues "right-footed shot struck the bottom left corner from the marksman's point of view - 1-0 (71.).
20 minutes left, which should be a hell of a long time.
And then this: VfL captain Florian Quabeck unfortunately flew the leather in the penalty area in the 80th minute.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the spot.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Wolbeck had to endure anxious minutes in the closing stages before Geske scored the winning goal from 12 metres in the 87th minute.
It might have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

As of September 1, only 8 percent of the board members were female, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture," which will be officially presented this Monday by the Allbright Foundation and was available in advance to the Deutsche Presse-Agentur.
"Companies will have to position themselves differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass them by," said Wiebke Ankersen, managing director of the foundation.
In the USA, Great Britain or Sweden, all-male management teams - with a few exceptions - are no longer conceivable.
In comparison, the gap makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.

Moreover, the slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies can be attributed solely to positive impulses among the companies in the index of medium-sized stocks (MDax).
True, according to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8 percent.
Among the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women has stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women served on the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit women more consistently in the coming year - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signalled that they would not continue to make a voluntary commitment to increase the share from "zero percent" to date.
A different picture emerges with regard to the supervisory boards: as of 1 September, the proportion of women there was 30.5 percent - 45 more women and 68 fewer men than a year ago.
"If the same number of women were recruited to the boards each year, the proportion would reach 40 per cent by 2023," the report said.

Manchester United lose again, it's uncomfortable for Mourinho
After their embarrassing exit in the League Cup, Manchester United are now also losing in the seventh round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United, ManU lost 1-3. The manner of the defeat should still give something to talk about.
The scene was emblematic in the 74th minute, when the recovered Marko Arnautovic scored for West Ham to make it 3-1, just three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
Suspecting an offside on Mark Noble's pass, all the Manchester City defenders stopped and gave Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative climax of a performance that had already been inadequate for a long time.

However, the Gunners fans, led by Granit Xhaka, had to wait until the 81st minute for a result against the surprise team from County Hertfordshire.
With nine minutes to go, Watford defender Craig Cathcart was unfortunate to concede an own goal from Alex Iwobi, only for Mesut Özil to score his third goal of the season just two minutes later.
Arsenal moved past Watford thanks to a fifth successive win and are now just behind big rivals Tottenham in fifth place, while promoted Wolverhampton continue to make a strong impression under their Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
Wolves remained unbeaten in the league for the fifth year in a row with a 2-0 win over Southampton and are in eighth place.

1: 4 against Frankfurt: Hanover with fourth bankruptcy of the season: "Crappy situation"
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around him and encouraged them.
However, there was not much positive to see in the 1: 4 (0: 2) of last place in the table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a crappy situation, but you have to get out of it as a team," said 96-year-old professional football player Pirmin Schwegler, adding: "Of course it's disappointing, because you always put a lot of effort into it."
The further winless Lower Saxony, for whom only Florent Muslija (86.) scored, stand with two points at the bottom and are in their current condition a relegation candidate.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, however, Frankfurt celebrated their first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45. + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored the goals for the DFB Cup winner in front of a crowd of 46,300. After the successful dress rehearsal for the Europa League game against Lazio Rom, he advanced to the middle of the table with seven points.
Croatia's World Cup runner-up Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous attacking move on his debut and was never able to get a grip on Hannover's defence.
The striker, long out of action after the World Cup, showed with his pace and assertiveness why he is so valuable to Eintracht.
In addition to Rebic, Brazilian Allan, on loan from Liverpool FC, was in the starting line-up for the first time for the Frankfurt side, who started brightly.
A header from Lucas Torró (17th) deflected into the net brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller, in a promising position, was stopped at the last moment by the 96 defence around Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-lived Kevin Wimmer (back).
The lead for the hosts was almost inevitable and fully deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a deflected corner, Haller extended his header in front of goal, where Ndicka only had to put his foot down.
It was the first Bundesliga goal for the defender, who joined from French second division side AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt eased up before the break.
This time Haller matched his storm partner Rebic, who skillfully tanked his way through and gave 96-goalkeeper Michael Esser no chance.
At half-time, Hannover coach Breitenreiter reacted to the poor performance of his team and brought in two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony played now somewhat more courageously forward, igniting ideas remained however until shortly before the end, when at least the follow-up goal succeeded.
The Hessians were much more efficient there.
After just under an hour Rebic launched a solo and then laid across to De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was just a show for the Frankfurt side against overwhelmed visitors, with Jovic also scoring with a minute to go.
The summer itself was also unusually wet.

Inauguration: New residence hall in the Neu-Ulm Münsterblickstraße
The Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller is opening a new residential home for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
All those present at the inauguration agreed that "a very special house" will now be handed over to its purpose in Münsterblickstraße.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the residence hall of Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas were taken into account by architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former officers "building of the US Army was put to the test for residents with a mobile phone cap:" The house was getting old and out of date in terms of equipment, "Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, the diggers moved in to demolish the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible, so that the residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new residence hall
Lebenshilfe invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450,000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both in terms of time and money.
The managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof construction has not always been easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications, which allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom of being able to move without outside help.
The head of the social administration of the Swabian district, Gertrud Kreutmayer, made a similar comment: "The house is oriented towards the special needs of its residents, who need tools to be mobile."
The cosiness and functionality have been well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And further: "The property in this situation is a real stroke of luck, because it can no longer be acquired in this way in the current situation."
In total, the new residence hall in Münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities on an area of almost 1500 square metres, divided into three residential groups.

Colour powder and eggs: Riots in Barcelona ahead of Catalonia anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of Catalonia's controversial independence referendum.
But even before that, there are riots.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Clashes between separatists and police broke out in central Barcelona on the eve of the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on October 1, 2017.
Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence protesters with paint powder, among other things, as they tried to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and Civil Guard.
Around 3,000 officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wanted to hold a rally to honour their colleagues who were deployed at polling stations during last year's referendum, which was deemed illegal.
There had also been violence at the time in an attempt to prevent citizens from voting.
Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of separatists and central government security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
Some of the approximately 6,000 separatists then tried to break the police chain by force, throwing paint bags and eggs at the officers, among other things.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured, it said, citing authorities.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.

Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Gathered perplexity: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen part ways without a goal
Red-and-white awls continue to appear on the spot.
Even at FC Gütersloh it was only enough for a 0-0 draw.
In front of a crowd of 438 in the Heidewald Stadium, they turned out to be helpless at the end and the third last.
The first half was poor from the entertainment point of view.
Those who therefore preferred to get a beer or a sausage, could do so without worry.
There was no danger of missing a scoring chance because there were virtually none.
First shot after half an hour
Gütersloh's Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) shot on goal of the entire match in the 28th minute.
The Ahlener had the best - and in principle the only real - opportunity when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling into a parade with a shot from the penalty area after 32 minutes.
The hosts were even more innocuous.
Their most effective action was to make an early change.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, Sinan Aygün came in for him.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel took aim from 18 metres just above the box and after an hour the Gütersloh players also made their first offensive appearance.
After a conquest of the ball by Matthäus Wieckowicz it was fixed.
Nick Flock (62.) "crowned" the briskly presented counter-attack over Sinan Aygün with a lax shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they followed up with a header from Wieckowicz (66th) after a corner ball from former Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, first bringing in Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.).
It made a difference - nothing.
The Ahlens did not achieve more than visual superiority thanks to their own initiative.
It wasn't until the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had his last chance, but even that came to nothing.
Angelo Daut tried to emphasize the positives afterwards: "I like the fact that we played to zero." But unfortunately, the zero was also in front.
"We were not as dangerous this time as we were against Holzwickede, even though our opponent had no desire to play here," stated RW Ahlen's interim coach.
Offensively, "everything was rippling a little bit" against a team that "just wanted to defend.
In any case, I didn't feel we could get a goal against them, "Daut said.
Unfortunately for him, as a spectator, you did not feel as if his team could score a goal.

Smears with a local political message: No successful advertising for skate park
In Lengerich, unknown people have promoted the construction of a skate park in a hardly conducive way.
In several places there are corresponding smears, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration on request of the WN.
In at least one case, criminal charges have been filed with the police for damage to property.
The three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" are emblazoned in large letters on signs at, among others, the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that a corresponding lettering on the advertising sign on the staircase to the Gempt Bistro had already been discovered after the vocational election fair on 19 September.
Since the short message had apparently been left "only" with an edding at the time, it could easily have been removed.
"A few days later, it was there again, this time sprayed on," Rottmann said.
He assumes that the relevant advertising sign will have to be replaced.
A special note is given to this particular case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skate park is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already commitments, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department of school, sport and culture, without naming names.
It is quite possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to the companies that appear on the smeared board.

Public procurement of works and prevention of corruption
Joint report of the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel audits
Introduction and overview
The award of services by contracting authorities is of great importance both for the state and for the economy.
The role of the state is to make the most economical and economical use of public funds and to ensure fair and regulated competition.
In the European Union (EU), the award of services by contracting authorities is an important part of the creation of a single economic area.
In order to ensure largely unrestricted competition across borders, contracting authorities have to comply with EU requirements when awarding contracts above certain value limits (thresholds).
To this end, the EU member states have to transpose and apply EU public procurement law into national law.
This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.
Below the EU thresholds, it is up to individual countries to regulate the award of public contracts themselves.
The awarding of services is also an area at risk of corruption.
Because of the inherently high potential for damage, contracting authorities are therefore required to take appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and improper favours in the award of their contracts.
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed in January 2011 to carry out parallel audits on both the EU-wide award of construction services and the prevention of corruption.
The audits focused on the application of EU public procurement law, which has been transposed into national legislation, as well as on the prevention of corruption in the award of works in building construction, road construction and transport infrastructure.
Procurement below the EU thresholds has also been included in the considerations with a view to preventing corruption.
The results of the audit of both courts are summarised in this Joint Report.
The report will also be addressed to international institutions, such as the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).
Audit areas and audited bodies The evaluations of the Federal Audit Office on the listed topics are predominantly based on cross-sectional audits, which it carried out in the years 2011 / 2012 at the construction authorities, which are responsible for the road and building construction of the federal government in Germany.
He examined, for example, the construction of motorways and large-scale building projects.
In addition, the Federal Audit Office drew on results from previous investigations.
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic based its evaluations on audit findings from the years 2008 to 2011. The audits covered construction measures in road construction, railway infrastructure construction, hydraulic engineering, building construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.) as well as other construction areas in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the awarding of federal public contracts is mainly carried out by the construction administrations of the federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the State Construction Administration is centrally responsible for awarding contracts in the field of transport infrastructure.
In building construction, the awarding of contracts is carried out decentrally by those bodies that use state budget resources.
In both countries, freelancers will also be involved for parts of the award procedures.
When comparing the evaluations, differences in public procurement law and in the market structure for construction services in both countries must be taken into account.

In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide procurement procedures is laid down in laws and regulations.
Procurement procedures limited to the national area are governed by budgetary law and the administrative rules based on it.
In addition, for both EU-wide and national procurement, many complementary individual rules are laid down by internal administrative provisions,
such as the so-called "Procurement Handbooks" of the Federal Government, in which the legal requirements are supplemented or further formulated in compliance with public procurement law case law.
In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure is governed exclusively by the Public Procurement Act and other legal provisions applicable to both above and below the EU thresholds.
The public procurement law was substantially amended in 2012.
The new rules increased transparency in the management of public funds, allowed for greater competition and limited the scope for corruption in the procurement process.
Broad outlines of public procurement law in both countries
In both countries, the open procedure, the non-open procedure and the negotiated procedure apply in particular to EU-wide contracts.
In Germany, measures below the EU threshold are subject to the national types of award (public tender, restricted tender, hands-free award), which largely correspond to the above-mentioned EU-wide types of award.
Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of the primacy of open procedure (for contracts to be awarded throughout the EU) and public tendering (for national contracts).
In the open procedure and in the public tender process, any interested company can submit an offer.
Another essential feature of German public procurement law is the promotion of medium-sized enterprises.
For this purpose, above all, the division of an overall construction project into specialist and partial lots serves.
The individual awarding of these lots is intended to enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.
Both of the above-mentioned features of German public procurement law are proven instruments for achieving economic results.
More than 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees are active in Germany.
In the Czech Republic, EU-wide procurement procedures are also applicable to construction projects below the EU threshold.
An exception to this is the simplified procedure, which allows a less stringent procedure to be applied below the thresholds and under certain conditions.
Czech public procurement law provides, in line with EU law, that contracts should be concluded when competition is ensured and a favourable price is achieved.
Current legislation in the Czech Republic allows contracting authorities to choose between the open and the non-open procedure.
There are more than 85,000 construction companies in the Czech Republic, of which about 1,900 are companies with 20 or more employees.
Construction volume of contracting authorities and shares of the types of contracts awarded in both countries
In Germany, the total construction volume in 2011 was 307 billion euros.
Of this, 45.5 billion euros were allocated to public construction (15%), which, in addition to federal construction, includes in particular the construction measures of the federal states and municipalities.
The construction volume of the federal government in building construction and highway construction (excluding rail infrastructure construction and hydraulic engineering) amounted to 8.5 billion euros.
The volume of contracts for construction works in the building construction and highway construction of the federal government was distributed among the award types in 2011 as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public tenders, 12.7% non-open procedures and restricted tenders and 6.6% negotiated procedures and private tenders.
Of these, 33.2% were pan-European contracts.
The volume of public works projects in the Czech Republic amounted to EUR 4.7 billion in 2011, which represented about 25% of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.
In 2009, the volume amounted to 7.8 billion euros, which represented 37% of the total construction volume.
Breakdown by type of award for 2011: 65.1% open procedures 14.3% non-public procedures 9.5% negotiated procedures 8.4% simplified procedures for volumes below the threshold 2.7% other procedures
The data relate to all public contracts for supplies, services and works awarded by public procurement authorities in 2011.
The above-mentioned data show that the parallel audits of both countries focus on an important part of public procurement, that the prevention of corruption, which must be observed in all procurement procedures, is of great financial importance and that the open procedure and the public procurement procedure play a prominent role in the award of the contracts.
Summary of the results of the parallel tests
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have carried out parallel audits in their respective countries on the EU-wide award of construction services and the prevention of corruption.
In this context, the working groups of the two Court of Auditors compared the relevant legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany, as well as the results of their parallel audits, which they carried out in particular in the areas of building construction and road construction.
The main findings were as follows:
The EU Directives on the award of works by contracting authorities have been transposed into national law in both the Czech Republic and Germany (Nos. 1 and 3.1).
In addition to the EU requirements, the procurement regulations of both countries also serve to prevent corruption, some of which differ in their focus and in their detail (No. 3.2).
In both countries, an essential requirement of the procurement documents is that they must contain all the information necessary for the proper preparation of tenders.
The performance descriptions must be neutral and must not contain any requirements that restrict competition.
In Germany, the award documents have largely complied with these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, it is still a problem to sufficiently identify the object of the contract.
In Germany, construction works are to be divided into lots if possible in order to promote competition.
According to the findings of the BRH, this requirement has been largely implemented in Germany.
In its audits, in particular in the field of road construction, the NKÚ found that the award of large-scale services without lots or with very large lots may distort competition and lead to a restriction to only a few large companies.
Narrowing the market potential can lead to significant cost increases and carry the risk of price or other agreements.
In accordance with the provisions of both countries, the contracting authorities may, under certain conditions, agree in principle with the companies already contracted to provide additional or modified services that prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (No. 4.1).
The respective requirements for determining the type of award were largely followed in both countries.
Under the rules of the Czech Republic, contracting authorities are free to choose between open and closed procedures.
In Germany, on the other hand, the statutory and budgetary primacy of the open procedure for EU-wide procurement or the public tender, which corresponds to the open procedure for national procurement, applies.
This will allow more companies to bid.
This reduces the risk of corruption, makes price-fixing between bidders more difficult and leads to the most economic results.
In the case of construction projects whose estimated total contract values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited works administrations tendered the works in principle throughout Europe.
The correct estimation of the expected value of the contract is an essential basis for choosing the right type of award.
In Germany, cost databases are used to calculate the costs of public buildings, in particular in building construction,
which are based on the evaluations of completed construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the field of road construction, but it is not yet an effective tool (point 4.2).
In the case of works to be awarded throughout Europe, preliminary information and announcements must be published in order to strengthen competition by enabling interested companies to prepare for the planned contracts at an early stage.
As a rule, the audited building authorities complied with this requirement.
In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or lack of controls may have affected competition (point 4.3).
The selection of candidates to participate in non-public procurement procedures is particularly vulnerable to manipulation.
Under EU law, the number of invited candidates must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, non-discriminatory and must be announced in advance.
In addition to the EU requirements, contracting authorities in both countries should switch as often as possible among the companies to be requested when selecting candidates.
In order to counter the risk of manipulation, there are in some cases very detailed requirements in Germany.
In some cases, the audited administrations did not take these requirements into account.
In the Czech Republic, the decisions on the selection of candidates were not always comprehensible (point 4.4).
In both countries, in the interest of a level playing field, it is necessary to ensure that companies interested in submitting bids receive the same information during the bidding phase.
Contact between these companies and with freelancers who were involved in the preparation of the service description is to be avoided as far as possible in order to avoid anti-competitive agreements.
The corresponding regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.
However, some of the audited building administrations in Germany did not comply with these requirements (No. 4.5).
In opening up offers in both countries, the principle of multi-eyes and the principle of transparency must be observed in particular.
The specifications for the labelling, documentation, safekeeping and confidentiality of the offers are intended to restrict scope for manipulation and are laid down in particular detail in Germany.
The tests carried out in both countries resulted in only a few complaints (point 4.6).
Examination and evaluation of the bids are defined in both countries by guidelines for the organisation of the structure and process.
The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been consistently observed by the audited contracting authorities.
For example, contracting authorities handed over tenders to third parties for examination without first reviewing the tenders and adequately documenting any abnormalities.
As a result, the offers were insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulation (point 4.7).
At the conclusion of the EU-wide tendering procedures, the companies involved in the competition will be informed of the envisaged award of the contract before the award of the contract.
This possibility of legal protection also has a preventive function against corrupt behaviour.
The Czech Republic also provides for the possibility of judicial review for non-EU public procurement procedures.
Only in a few cases did the contracting authorities fail to observe the prescribed deadlines when awarding contracts or deviate from the bidders "offer in terms of content (point 4.8).
The documentation of the procurement procedures was not always complete or comprehensible with the audited building administrations in both countries.
In this respect, the EU-wide transparency requirement has not been sufficiently implemented in the award notices of some procedures.
Also, some of the shortcomings identified diminished the anti-corruption function of the documentation.
The contracting authorities of both countries complied to a large extent with their reporting and reporting obligations (point 4.9).
Fundamentals of EU public procurement law and the prevention of corruption
EU public procurement law
In order to ensure unrestricted competition within the European Union with the free movement of services and goods, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, among other things, the Procurement Coordination Directive and the Remedies Directive, which had to be transposed into national law by the member states.
The general tendering principles of the European Union are, in particular, the principle of competition, the principle of equal treatment, the principle of non-discrimination and the principle of transparency.
In order to achieve these objectives, the Procurement Coordination Directive sets out specific rules for works to be awarded across the EU for construction projects.
For this purpose, their expected order amounts must reach or exceed a current volume of 5,000,000 euros.
The rules concern in particular the content of the award documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, the observance of deadlines, inter alia for the receipt of tenders, the documentation of the award procedure, the requirements that can be placed on the qualifications of candidates and the Remedies Directive provides the basis for the legal protection of candidates and tenderers.
In the event of possible infringements of public procurement law, the companies concerned can have the decisions of the contracting authorities reviewed in review procedures.
Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the European Union Directives into national law.
Prevention of corruption
The importance of preventing corruption
In both countries, there is no legal definition of corruption.
In general, corruption is the abuse of a position of trust for private gain,
which is usually initiated by the beneficiaries of these decisions.
Corruption can hamper competition and lead to significant economic damage.
It is estimated that the global cost of corruption is 5% of world economic output.
For the European Union, the level of these costs is estimated at 1%.
In the case of contracting authorities, restrictive agreements or unfair practices may call into question confidence in the integrity and functioning of the administration.
The prevention of corruption is therefore one of the fundamental tasks of contracting authorities.
They have to check the structure and operation of their administrations for areas particularly vulnerable to corruption, in order to take appropriate safeguards against corruption there.
Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly reduce the vulnerability of decision-making processes to corrupt abuse.
The award of public works is generally regarded as a particularly corruption-prone area of work.
Measures to prevent corruption
In Germany, corruption - in particular bribery and corruption, as well as the acceptance and approval of benefits - is prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
In order to prevent corruption, the Federal Government has issued a guideline and recommendations for the prevention of corruption12 in the Federal Administration. According to this guideline, in addition to risk analysis, the following principles must be observed in particular for the award area: Priority of public tenders and open procedures, multi-eyes principle and transparency, fundamental separation of planning, awarding and accounting, precise and complete documentation of the award procedures.
In addition, other anti-corruption requirements have been incorporated into the public procurement legislation.
For example, the responsible Federal Ministry for Procurement in the area of federal highways introduced an electronically supported control system in 2011,
with the assignment data − such as the estimated costs and the order sums − as well as information on the freelancers involved are collected nationwide and evaluated for any abnormalities.
In the Czech Republic, corruption is also prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
The statutory requirements of transparency and equal treatment of tenderers, as well as the prohibition of any form of discrimination, are the most important foundations for preventing corruption.
For public procurement, the Czech government has defined anti-corruption measures in an anti-corruption strategy paper for the years 2011 to 2012 and updated them for the years 2013 to 2014.
Some of the measures recommended in it have already been transposed into national public procurement legislation and related administrative legislations14.
The main provisions of the new legislation are: lowering the thresholds for smaller contracts, mandatory prior notification of contracts by the contracting authority, including indication of the reasons for tendering, prohibition of restricting the number of tenderers in non-open procedures and thus eliminating the possibility of selecting tenderers by lottery, introduction of the obligation to publish contract documents and all annexes, introduction of the obligation to publish the actual price and list of subcontractors.
Results of the examination of the individual stages of the award procedure
Procurement documents
Procurement documents The procurement documents must contain all the information required by the bidders for the proper preparation of a bid.
In particular, the award documents must enable an accurate calculation to be made.
Bidders must not be entrusted with risks that cannot be calculated for them.
The award documents consist in particular of the service description and the terms of the contract.
In addition, they contain the requirements for proving the qualification (suitability) of the bidders as well as the criteria that are decisive for the selection of the most economical offer.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
The requirements of EU law for public procurement documents are addressed in particular to the technical specifications.
These must be equally accessible to all bidders and should restrict competition as little as possible.
The service description must in principle be product-neutral.
For this reason, information on products or manufacturers as part of the service description is only permitted under strict conditions.
The avoidance of anti-competitive requirements in the procurement documents is also a fundamental principle of preventing corruption.
In addition, unclear or incorrect information in the award documents must be avoided, as it opens up scope for speculation in the preparation of the bids and for manipulation of their valuation.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations In both countries, EU legal requirements on technical specifications have been transposed into national law.
In principle, the services are to be advertised in a product-neutral manner without manufacturer specifications.
In the service descriptions, the individual services must, as a rule, be subdivided into service units with respective quantities.
Prices are to be agreed on the basis of performance units (e.g. Euro per m ² or per piece).
Only in exceptional cases may benefits be defined by functional targets.
The service descriptions must in any case be complete and unambiguous.
They must contain precise quantities and must not include services for which it is not clear whether they are needed.
Compensation according to lump sums or time expenditure is to be avoided as far as possible.
These provisions are intended to put an end to speculation and manipulation based on vague specifications in the award documents.
The service specifications must enable bidders to prepare their offers safely and without extensive preparatory work.
The call for tenders will not be made public until the tender documents have been completed.
Different rules
There is no obligation to tender works in lots in the Czech Republic.
If it is possible according to the type of service to be commissioned, the public contracting authorities may divide construction work into several lots.
In Germany, construction works are generally to be divided into lots, separately according to the quantity (partial lots) and / or according to type or subject area (specialist lots).
The aim is to enable small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in competition, to expand the number of possible suppliers and to make price agreements more difficult.
This type of award is generally considered to be the most economical.
In the Czech Republic, evaluation criteria must be indicated in the award documents for both EU-wide and national procedures.
The aim is to make it fully and conclusively clear to applicants on the basis of which criteria their offers should be evaluated.
In Germany, the indication of evaluation criteria in EU-wide announcements, but at the latest in the award documents, is only required in the EU-wide award procedures.
In the case of national award procedures, the evaluation criteria are only to be set out in an internal administrative award note.
Procurement documents drawn up by commissioned freelancers may not contain any references to these offices or involved planners or appraisers in Germany with the building construction and some road construction administrations.
The aim is to prevent individual companies from obtaining additional information or other undue competitive advantages through contact with these freelancers without the knowledge of the client.
This is also the reason why freelancers are not allowed to send out award documents or interpret planning documents for inspection.
The contact person of the companies is the client alone.
There is currently no regulation on this in the Czech Republic.
Additional or modified services, which turn out to be necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (supplements), are almost always required for large construction projects.
In both countries, the legal provisions make it possible, to a certain extent, to award supplements to the company already contracted, without the need for a tender procedure with public notice.
According to the EU regulations and the German regulations, the remuneration for supplementary services may not exceed half of the main contract.
In addition, the additional services may not be separated from the main contract without significant disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.
In the Czech Republic, a narrower limit of 20% applies to the award of such contracts without public notice.
However, this may increase the risk of a delayed completion of the construction project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the construction work already under way.
If supplementary services are also assigned to the already commissioned company, an arbitrary price increase for these services by the contractor is in principle not possible according to the regulations in Germany.
When determining the remuneration for the additional services, it must rather be based on the agreed prices and the basis for determining the price of the order already placed.
In addition to supplementary services, there may also be a reduction in the scope of services.
In the Czech Republic, reduced quantities cannot be offset against additional supplementary services.
Key audit results
BHR
Technical specifications and product-neutral tender
In individual cases, the performance specifications contained references to national technical approvals or standards that had already been replaced by Europe-wide standards.
Some performance specifications also contained product-related specifications - for example, for graffiti protection, joint tapes or noise protection panels - without this being necessary.
In some cases, performance requirements were described so precisely that only one product could be considered.
List of benefits broken down by sub-services
In none of the examined proceedings has the BRH found violations of the requirement to tender services in principle in a list of services subdivided according to partial services.
Completeness of the service specifications
In the vast majority of cases, the procurement documents were completed before the start of the tenders.
For some procedures, the procurement documents had to be corrected during the tender phase, as some positions or deadlines had changed.
In some cases, the performance sheets contained items where it was not clear whether they were needed.
A list of services for demolition work even consisted of almost half of such demand items.
Lots and scoring criteria
With many assignments the prescribed reason was missing, why the achievements tendered predominantly after specialized ones were not further divided into partial lots.
There were no objections in the indication of the criteria to be used in the evaluation of the offers.
References to self-employed workers
A small part of the service descriptions contained references to the freelancers involved.
Some of their names were on the cover pages or in attached plans or expert opinions.
In one case, the contracting authority even explicitly asked applicants to contact the architect "on questions relating to the tender process."
In the building construction sector in particular, the contracting authorities attributed the above-mentioned complaints predominantly to omissions on the part of the freelancers commissioned to draw up the performance specifications.
The construction services pointed out the lack of capacity to adequately control the specifications of the services.
New York
Technical specifications and product-neutral tendering During the public procurement process for the construction of a residential building with 12 residential units, a supplier and a specific product brand were specified in the service specification.
The contracting authority did not allow the use of comparable products without justification.
During the construction of several university buildings, suppliers and products were also specified in the tender.
Performance specifications with performance units
In the case of construction projects in some industrial areas, the contracting authority did not clearly specify the scope and nature of the required services in the service specifications.
As performance units, it only indicated the converted space of the individual buildings in cubic metres.
Completeness of the service specifications
In the case of the construction of a motorway bypass, the specifications were amended four times during a closed procedure between August and September 2009,
because the scope of services had significantly increased and the technical requirements had changed.
Tendering documents for social buildings contained inaccurate location information, insufficient preliminary structural studies and incomplete design drawings, which meant additional services had to be commissioned.
In the case of the construction of a large library building, the specifications of the interior equipment did not contain any product quality requirements.
As a result of this lack of specifications, some subcontractors installed overpriced and unreasonably high-quality equipment.
Lots and eligibility criteria
In the Czech Republic, the division of works into partial lots or the award of partial contracts is not mandatory.
An examination of the three major sections of the construction of a motorway ring showed that savings of up to 31.6 million euros out of a total cost of 620.3 million euros would have been possible if selected parts had been awarded in batches.
In the case of six different buildings alone, which were the subject of a single contract, 2.5 million euros (25%) could have been saved if they had been awarded in batches.
If the construction of 20 bridges had been awarded separately, savings of 11.5 million euros (25%) would have been possible compared to a total award.
When awarding construction services in road construction, the central contracting authority specified very extensive reference requirements as suitability criteria.
In the case of the construction of part of a motorway, the contracting authority required bidders in an open procedure, inter alia, to provide evidence of at least three completed road construction projects, each worth EUR 28 million over the last five years.
In the Czech Republic, a maximum of nine suppliers met these requirements.
The public procurement of another section of a motorway consisted of six separate construction projects, for which the contracting authority had set an annual construction volume of at least €480 million over the last three years as an eligibility criterion for the companies.
Two thirds of the funds allocated to road projects in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. €2.5 billion out of a total of €3.7 billion) were for contracts awarded by a total of five companies, which carried out the contracts alone or as a joint venture.
Out of 46 procurement procedures with a contract volume of €528 million, only two or even only one bidder submitted an offer.
The NKÚ pointed out that a narrowing of the market potential can result in significant cost increases.
Additional services
In the case of the construction of a motorway bypass, the contracting authority did not apply any of the procedures required by law when awarding additional services in two cases, nor did it conclude any written contracts for the additional services.
Due to unclear quantity and quality specifications, supplements of up to EUR 63.7 million (net) were incurred in the first case and up to EUR 165.4 million (net) in the second case, which increased the respective order volume by 21% and 91% respectively.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFT blank
In the case of several university buildings, some services were not listed in the award documents, although their necessity was already known when the contract was awarded.
Although the volume of these additional services exceeded the limit of 20% of the initial contract value set out in national public procurement law, the contracting authority carried out negotiated procedures with the contracting companies without publication of the contract.
In the case of the construction of a large court building, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional works in negotiated procedures without tendering.
During the construction period, the contracting authority extended the scope of the work by 2 million euros.
The standard prices for the additional works awarded without competition were significantly higher than comparable services provided by the same company.
Other findings
On the basis of a random audit of construction projects, NKÚ found that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway kilometre in the Czech Republic is up to EUR 14.6 million.
In Germany, on the other hand, according to an analysis of long-term data by the Federal Ministry of Construction, the average cost of a four-lane motorway kilometre is up to 10.4 million euros.
This comparison indicates that motorway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.
Summary findings
The basic rules on procurement documents are broadly in line in both countries and take into account the EU requirements.
They serve both to ensure comprehensive and fair competition and to prevent corruption.
For example, the requirement that the service descriptions be sufficiently specific should enable bidders to calculate and draw up their offers in an appropriate manner,
protect the client from additional services to be agreed upon retrospectively and also limit the scope for speculation.
In Germany, the common basic requirements for the award documents are supplemented by regulations aimed at further reducing restrictions on competition and opportunities for manipulation.
In the Czech Republic, there are no requirements to this extent, but transparency will be increased by publishing the evaluation criteria for non-EU procurement procedures.
The requirements for performance specifications have largely been met in both countries.
In some cases, however, derogations have had to be complained about, which may also have led to restrictions on competition.
The existing requirement in Germany for the formation of lots promotes competition and leads to economic results.
In the Czech Republic, according to the audit findings of the NKÚ, the award of large-scale services without lots or with very large lots may result in restrictions on the field of suppliers to only a few large companies.
The extensive reference requirements imposed in the Czech Republic for road construction have meant that public contracts are awarded only to a narrow group of suppliers and that small and medium-sized enterprises are not allowed to compete.
Also, a limited number of competitors often leads to higher prices and increases the risk of price or other collusion.
With regard to the award and remuneration of additional or modified services, the regulatory approaches differ in both countries.
According to the EU requirements as well as the German regulations, supplementary services with a value of up to half of the main contract can be awarded under certain conditions without a procurement procedure with public notice.
In the Czech Republic, there is a narrower limit of 20%, up to which additional services can be awarded to the original contractor in a negotiated procedure without notice.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFT blank
This limit is often exceeded,
as the scope of services for public contracts is often insufficiently defined.
If the excess is greater than 20%, the additional services must be put out to tender with a public notice.
By dividing services into lots, restrictions on competition and the resulting adverse consequences can be avoided.
Defining the type of award and taking into account the EU threshold
By determining the type of award, the contracting authority determines the scope of the number of companies participating in the competition.
It may leave the circle of possible candidates and bidders largely unlimited, for example by choosing an open procedure, or by imposing non-public procurement procedures.
For construction projects where a threshold set by the EU is reached or exceeded, Europe-wide procurement procedures must be followed.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
When selecting the type of award, the contracting authority has to take into account, in particular, the requirements of European law on competition and transparency.
If the estimated total contract value of the construction works of a project is at or above the EU threshold of currently 5,000,000 euros, the construction works must in principle be awarded throughout Europe according to open or non-open procedures.
In exceptional cases, negotiated procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.
In the case of construction projects that reach or exceed the EU threshold, the contracting authority may deviate to a limited extent from the principle of pan-European procurement and award works in national procurement procedures, provided that the estimated contract value of the respective lot is less than EUR 1,000,000 and the sum of these lots does not exceed 20% of the estimated total contract value of all works contracts.
A uniform construction project may not be divided into individual measures without compelling reason or deliberately estimated at too low cost values in order to remove it from the obligation to award construction services on a Europe-wide basis.
As restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of the type of award is of great importance in preventing corruption.
The detailed justification of the chosen type of award as well as the examination of the application of the EU public procurement rules are important elements of the documentation of the award procedure.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have fully transposed EU legislation on procurement procedures and thresholds into national law.
Different rules
The Czech Republic has also transferred the fundamental equality of open and non-open procedures contained in the EU Directive to its public works contracts, which are not subject to EU requirements.
There is freedom of choice between the open and the non-open procedure, without the decision having to be documented or justified. However, other procedures are only possible under certain legally defined conditions.
In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure or - in the case of national contracts - the public procurement procedure generally takes precedence. This is laid down by budgetary and public procurement law as well as by the directives on the prevention of corruption.
Other types of award - such as the non-open procedure or the restricted tender procedure - are only possible in exceptional cases, which are finally regulated by public procurement law.
The existence of an exceptional case must be justified and documented in a comprehensible manner.
The principle of the primacy of the open procedure or public tender is intended to ensure that competition is as unrestricted as possible, to exclude the possibility of manipulation by targeting specific bidders and to make possible price-fixing between bidders more difficult.
In Germany, the principle of public tendering is a key element in preventing corruption.
The correct estimation of the expected value of the contract is an essential basis for choosing the right type of award.
The construction services in Germany can rely on planning and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations to determine the likely costs in the area of public building construction.
These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects. The databases contain, among other things, cost characteristics for building categories, usage units, building elements or individual construction services.
On the basis of such cost indicators, the estimated contract value of a planned project or a construction work to be awarded can be determined.
Corresponding cost databases for road construction are only available to some building administrations in Germany.
However, a nationwide introduction for all road construction administrations is planned.
Contracting authorities in the Czech Republic cannot rely on central databases or average price calculations of comparable construction measures to determine the estimated costs of works.
In most cases, the cost calculations are based on estimates by the funding body or are based on the amount of funds made available to the construction service.
Measures to standardise cost assessment procedures are still in their infancy.
As part of the anti-corruption plan for 2011-2012, the relevant ministries were given the task of creating a database for standardised building materials and materials.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFT blank
This database is intended to collect information on material expenditure and construction and finishing works, as well as other cost-relevant data, in order to enable costs to be determined and uniform prices to be determined.
The Czech Ministry of Transport has also published a data collection for construction projects in order to better control costs,
which will be used as a benchmark when setting prices in the financing plan and is currently being updated.
Key test results BRH
Choice of award procedure
The audited contracting authorities tendered the works to a large extent in an open procedure or in a public tender and thus complied with the budgetary and public procurement requirements.
In 2011, 59.5% of the construction work carried out by the Federal Government in the field of building construction was put out to tender either publicly or in an open procedure.
In road construction, this proportion was 94.8%.
The choice of non-public procurement methods partly lacked detailed reasons as to why the contracting authorities had to deviate from the principle of open procedure or public tendering.
In a cross-sectional study, based on more than 16,000 public procurement procedures, the BRH found that non-public procurement methods have significant competitive disadvantages compared to open procedures and public tenders and increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.
In building construction, more than twice as many tenders were submitted for public tenders as for restricted tenders and almost three times as many tenders as for open-ended tenders.
The investigation also showed that the offer prices for restricted tenders and open tenders were on average 6% and 10% higher respectively than for public tenders.
Parallel investigations by the Federal Ministry of Construction and a State Audit Office confirmed the differences in profitability between public and non-public types of procurement.
As a result of its studies on economic efficiency, the Federal Ministry of Construction even found twice as high differences between public and non-public procurement procedures.
Taking into account the EU threshold
As a rule, the audited contracting authorities drew up procurement plans for the construction projects for which they had determined an estimated total contract amount of more than 5,000,000 euros, in which they defined the works to be awarded according to EU-wide and national procurement procedures.
According to the procurement plans, this meant that more than 80% of construction work was always to be awarded across the EU.
There was no circumvention of the obligation to award EU-wide contracts by under-estimating costs.
However, partly as a result of incorrect calculations, the minimum share of EU-wide procurement procedures actually fell below this level.
During the construction process, some contracting authorities improperly changed the definitions of their procurement plans.
They did not justify these changes and did not demonstrate that the minimum share of EU-wide procurement procedures continued to be respected.
For most of the works audited, the proportion of EU-wide contracts awarded according to the settlement results was generally lower than envisaged under the procurement plan.
In some cases, for construction projects above the EU threshold, the contracting authorities failed to comply with the requirement to tender all 1,000,000 euros or more of the single lots in EU-wide procedures,
and chose national procedures instead.
New York
Choice of type of award
In the case of several major construction projects, such as the construction of some sections of the motorway, construction projects in the context of a major sporting event and housing projects, the contracting authorities divided construction work into several sub-contracts, although these services were similar or comparable.
As a result of these allocations, the individual benefits were no longer above the threshold value and were subsequently awarded in simplified procedures or even in defiance of legal requirements.
Calculation methods for the estimated contract value
In the field of road construction, the existing price databases for this sector were an insufficient tool for determining the expected order values.
The data was based on construction projects that had just been completed, but in which there were indications of a lack of profitability, unnecessary additional effort or excessive profits of the contracted companies.
For three sections of a motorway ring, the actual prices were about 37% lower than the estimated order values calculated using the database.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Transport revised the databases to take into account not only the supply prices of recent years, but also comparable market prices and price increase indices in the construction sector.
In building construction, the expected order values were based on cost values estimated by the project architects or on estimates by investors.
The actual order values deviated greatly from the estimated values.
The estimated price for the conversion or extension of a large library was twice as high as the later agreed contract value, but eight supplements in the course of construction led to an increase in costs of 2.1 million euros or 27%.
Similarly, the actual value of the contract for the construction of a library depot was 33% lower than the estimated price, with cost increases in the construction phase.
In other cases, supply prices exceeded estimates and increased even while construction was being carried out.
In the case of the construction of a large library, the estimated price was exceeded by 16 million euros, or 22%. In the case of the construction of a judicial building, the costs rose disproportionately by 139%, as the usable area had only increased by 12%.
Summary findings
Both countries have transposed the EU regulations determining the type of award and taking into account the EU threshold into national law. Therefore, the respective regulations are largely in line with each other.
However, the primacy of the open procedure or public tender in Germany goes beyond the requirements of the EU and the rules in force in the Czech Republic.
Compared to non-public procurement procedures, public procedures or public tenders give more companies the opportunity to participate in competition.
Public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of tenders and to the most economical results.
The risk of corruption will be significantly improved by not limiting the field of candidates by tampering with the contracting authority's definitions and by making it more difficult for bidders to agree on prices.
The investigations have confirmed the advantages of the primacy of the open procedure or public tender in Germany.
Czech legislation allows contracting authorities to award contracts in an open or non-open procedure.
According to the latest changes in public procurement law, the number of bidders may no longer be limited in procedures with a previous competition.
Thus the non-open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.
In Germany, the contracting authorities have largely complied with the requirements for the primacy of the open procedure or public tender. In the Czech Republic, some services have been allocated inappropriately in order to circumvent the requirements for the selection of the type of award.
When taking into account the EU threshold value, errors had to be found in Germany, which resulted in a fall below the minimum share of benefits advertised throughout the EU.
In the Czech Republic, there is still no satisfactory solution to accurately determine the estimated costs of works and construction projects.
If necessary, the construction authorities should carry out further checks to ensure that the requirements for the selection of the type of contract and the scope of services to be tendered throughout the EU are complied with or that the conditions are created for appropriate cost calculations.
Preliminary information and notice
In the case of construction projects with construction works to be awarded throughout Europe, the public builder must inform interested companies about the planned contracts in advance of the tender.
Preliminary information and announcements form an important basis for Europe-wide competition.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
The preliminary information should contain the essential public procurement information on the planned construction projects.
They are required for works where the estimated total value of the contract exceeds or exceeds the EU threshold and where the contracting authority wishes to shorten the tendering periods for open or non-open procedures.
In announcements, the client is obliged to provide further details of the planned construction contracts to be awarded throughout Europe.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFT blank
In it, he has to make known, among other things, the scope of services, the process and execution dates, the special requirements as well as the evaluation criteria and their weighting.
When describing the object of the order, the vocabulary of the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV codes), which is standardised throughout Europe, is to be used.
Preliminary information and notices will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the procurement profile of the contracting authority.
In order to avoid discrimination against foreign interested parties, notices at national level may not contain any additional information and may only be issued after the text of the notice has been sent to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union.
Incomplete or incorrect information in the notice may affect competition and, where appropriate, may even encourage manipulation.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have fully transposed EU legislation on pre-notification and notification into national law.
Different rules
In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and notices must also be published in the case of works not to be awarded on a European scale.
Procurement procedures may start at the earliest one month after sending the preliminary information to the EU Official Journal (in the case of EU-wide contracts) or the national Official Journal (in the case of all contracts).
Only in exceptional cases can the publication of preliminary information be waived.
In Germany, no prior information is required in the non-EU-wide procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, announcements for public tenders and participation competitions prior to restricted tenders must be published on the Federal Internet portal and, where applicable, also in newspapers or magazines.
In the case of restricted tenders without a competition, notices of services to be awarded starting from 25,000 euros are required (ex ante transparency).
All planned lots of the construction projects are to be listed in the preliminary information.
In Germany this is of particular importance because of the small-scale nature of the loose building contracts.
The impact of this scheme is limited in the Czech Republic, where much less construction work is divided into lots.
Key audit results
BRH.
Preliminary information
The contracting authorities examined published preliminary information on all audited construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe.
In some open procedures, however, they shortened the deadlines for bids, even though the 52-day period between the sending of the preliminary information and the notices had not yet expired.
Other shortened procedures were only put out to tender after the 12-month period of validity of the prior information had already expired and before it was extended.
In many published preliminary information, there was no indication of the planned division of construction work into lots.
Announcements
Some of the notices issued by the audited bodies contained CPV codes which deviated from the information provided in the preliminary information or which did not accurately capture the required services.
In individual cases, notices at national level were published earlier or contained more information - for example on implementation deadlines - than the notices in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Ex-ante transparency
The contracting authorities of an audited construction authority had entrusted a service company with the publication of the national procurement procedures.
The company published the notifications on its own paid procurement platform.
However, the contracting authorities did not check whether the company had also forwarded the notifications to the free internet portal of the federal government as prescribed.
Samples showed that only one third of the notifications of the audited administration were published on this portal.
New York
Announcements
In the case of the construction of a sewage treatment plant, the contracting authority did not specify in its notice the criteria on which it intended to select the bidders.
The contracting authority was not able to prove how the bidders were selected.
The restriction of the number of bidders was allowed under the law in force at the time.
In the case of the construction of a motorway ring, in a non-open procedure, the contracting authority did not specify in the notice or in the documentation of the award procedure that it would assess the qualifications of the applicants and how many applicants it intended to admit to the competition.
In its assessment, the contracting authority concluded that all six applicants met the qualification requirements, but excluded the candidate with the worst ratings from the further procedure.
The procedure of the contracting authority was not transparent because it did not disclose information on the qualification criteria and the evaluation procedure at any point in the procedure.
Publication of the notices
During the renovation of the former military site, the contracting authority did not publish the tender.
Summary findings
The two-stage information system with advance information and notice is an important element in implementing the requirement for transparency in Europe-wide procurement, strengthening competition and thus also preventing corruption.
Both countries have implemented the EU requirements and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures, including in the area of national procurement:
Selection of candidates for non-public contracts
Unlike public procurement procedures, non-public procurement procedures do not allow every company interested in the performance of the services to be awarded to participate in the competition.
In the case of non-public procurement procedures, the contracting authority has to make a selection in advance of which companies should be invited to tender.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption EU rules allow for a limit on the number of candidates in EU-wide non-public procurement procedures.
However, in the case of non-open procedures, at least five companies are to be invited to tender.
At least three companies must be invited to participate in a negotiated procedure with a contract notice.
In any case, the number of invited applicants must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be announced in advance.
The selection of companies to be requested is a process within the procurement procedure that is highly vulnerable to manipulation, for example by giving unilateral preferential treatment to certain companies.
In addition, the restriction of competition to a small number of companies also favours possible collusion between candidates.
In both cases, the award result may be significantly impaired at the expense of the client.
The contracting authorities must therefore take special precautions against possible manipulation, carry out adequate controls and, in particular, ensure the transparency and traceability of this procedural step.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
The rules governing the selection of candidates are similar in both countries.
In addition to the EU requirements, contracting authorities should, when selecting applicants, switch among the companies to be requested as often as possible.
Nor must competition be limited to companies established in certain regions.
The awarding bodies must justify the selection of candidates and document the course of the selection procedure in their award notes.
Different rules
In Germany, at least three suitable applicants must be invited to tender in the case of restricted tenders and, in the case of hands-free tenders, in principle several suitable applicants must be invited to tender.
Under the new Czech rules, with the exception of two special areas, it is inadmissible to limit the number of bidders in non-open and negotiated procedures.
In Germany, the multi-eye principle must be taken into account when selecting companies.
For example, if an employee has proposed a number of undertakings for a non-public procurement procedure, the management level of the construction service or an agent from the contracting authority will normally have to amend this proposal by, for example, removing a proposed undertaking and / or supplementing a new undertaking.
This is to prevent a single person from being able to conclusively determine the group of companies to be involved in the competition.
Otherwise, in the event of manipulative intentions, this could allow for far-reaching collusion between the parties.
The list of companies to be requested must be treated confidentially, including with regard to freelancers, and must not be made publicly available.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFT blank
In the Czech Republic, there are no such rules for drawing up and keeping lists of candidates secret.
According to the German regulations, freelancers are not allowed to determine the companies to be requested, but can only make proposals to the contracting authority.
There is a regulatory gap in Czech legislation on this issue.
Key audit results
BRH.
Number of applicants
The requirement to require a minimum number of companies to tender for non-public contracts has been met, with a few exceptions.
An evaluation by the BRH of almost 7,000 non-Europe-wide tendering procedures for construction services in building construction revealed that the contracting authorities in Germany invited an average of 6.6 companies to tender for restricted tenders and an average of 4.4 companies to tender for open-ended tenders.
Change of companies and regional restrictions
In particular in the case of trades with few providers, the awarding bodies did not always change the circle of selected applicants.
Above all, they took into account companies already known to them and tried and tested from their point of view.
The reason given was that, in the case of non-public proceedings, it was necessary to ensure the suitability of the companies to be invited to compete before the invitation to tender was issued.
The BRH did not find an undue restriction to regional bidders in the non-public procurement procedures, but a higher proportion of regionally established companies than in public tenders.
The contracting authorities attributed this mainly to the fact that, on average, the scope of services in non-public procurement procedures is much smaller and therefore, for example, longer travel distances are more important than in public tenders.
More-eyes-principle and suggestions of freelancers
Contrary to the rules, the contracting authorities largely failed to have the proposed list of companies to be requested amended by an independent person.
They justified this in particular by a lack of processing capacity, deadline pressure or insufficient knowledge of alternative suitable companies.
It was also often not documented who had proposed the companies invited to bid.
Some samples showed that freelancers had drawn up the lists of candidates and that these proposals had been adopted unchanged by the contracting authorities.
As a result, the contracting authorities did not protect themselves from possible manipulation to the extent required.
Confidential treatment of bidder lists
In the case of a contracting authority, the lists of the companies to be requested were recorded in a data processing system which could be viewed by all employees of that service.
In the event of manipulative intentions, the names of the designated or authorised companies could have been passed on without authorisation and could, for example, have facilitated collusion between these companies.
Documentation
Only in a few cases did the documentation of the award procedures contain reasons for the selection of candidates.
New York
Selection of candidates
During the construction of a motorway ring, bidders were not provided with information on the evaluation criteria and procedures.
In the case of the non-open procedures for the development and modernisation of waterways and ports, the notices did not indicate how the selection of candidates should be carried out.
In one procedure, all eight participating candidates met the qualification requirements, exceeding the specified maximum number of companies to be admitted.
The award committee then carried out a lottery procedure to select the companies.
However, this approach, which was in principle permissible at the time, should have been cited as one of the criteria in the notice.
Summary findings
Due to the high risk of manipulation in the selection of candidates in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special precautions to prevent undue restrictions on competition.
With the multiple-eyes principle, the secrecy of the bidding lists and the sole authority of the contracting authorities to propose the companies to be requested, the German requirements limit such opportunities for abuse.
In the case of the Czech schemes, the newly introduced requirement of a largely unlimited number of bidders in non-public proceedings can in particular counteract possible manipulative restrictions.
However, the audit findings have shown that some of these requirements have not been sufficiently implemented and that the potential for manipulation to restrict the number of participants in these cases has not been sufficiently reduced.
The contracting authorities should fully address the shortcomings identified.
Offer phase
With the announcement of the award or the invitation to tender, the bidding phase begins, during which companies can draw up bids on the basis of the tender documents sent to them.
Candidates may submit their bids by the expiry of the offer period set by the registry.
The requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
There are no separate EU legal requirements for this stage of the award procedure.
The contracting authorities will have to comply with the national rules designed to counteract the potential for manipulation during the tender phase.
These are above all organisational requirements and controls.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
The award documents, on the basis of which the companies are to draw up their bids, are, in principle, to be sent only by the contracting authority.
Freelancers involved in the award procedure are not allowed to carry out this task.
The contracting authority must ensure that all applicants also receive the same information during the bidding phase.
In the event of any ambiguity in the award documents or any other questions relating to the call for tenders, only the registry may provide information to the candidates.
Freelancers in charge of drawing up the award documents are not allowed to provide information.
During the entire offer phase, contact between the commissioned freelancers and the applicants is to be prevented.
The self-employed must not become a hub of the procurement process through which contacts with anti-competitive consequences can be established.
Bids sent by post or directly must be submitted in a sealed envelope.
Electronically transmitted offers have to show a technical encryption.
Different rules
In Germany, the registry may also commission external service companies with the printing and dispatch of the award documents, whose employees are obliged to maintain the confidentiality of the offers and to diligently fulfil the contractual obligations.
In Germany, the bids received must be marked with an entrance stamp and forwarded directly, immediately and unopened to an employee responsible for safekeeping.
This official may not be involved in the award of the contract.
The offers received must be kept under lock and key until the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, the tenders received will be marked with a reference number.
The registry records the offer data, including order numbers, as well as the creation and receipt data, in a protocol.
The safekeeping of offers is not regulated in more detail in the Czech Republic.
Key audit results
BRH.
The audits at the tender stage focused mainly on the procurement procedures of a building construction administration.
Dispatch of the award documents
The contracting authorities of the audited building administration sent out the award documents themselves or had them printed and sent out by an external service company.
Freelancers did not send out procurement documents.
Information to applicants
For the most part, the audited building administration did not comply with the requirements for the separation of planning and awarding of contracts when appointing the contact persons for inquiries and information.
In the service descriptions, contrary to the specifications, it did not name employees from the contracting authority, but from the project managers as contact persons.
Some procurement documents even contained the names of the freelancers who had drawn up the performance specifications.
When enquiries were made during the offer phase, not all applicants received the same information in individual cases.
Marking of the offers
At the audited building administration, all tenders received were marked with an input stamp and an input note.
In the case of some hands-free contracts, however, the offers were received by freelancers, which contradicted the requirements for preventing corruption.
Storage of the offers
Once identified, not all tenders were sent directly and immediately to the safekeeping officer, who locked the tenders in a steel cabinet.
In the meantime, tenders had been filed at a construction site in an open compartment of the post office to which every member of staff had access.
Another department had hung up a letterbox in a corridor that was not constantly monitored, in which some of the offers that had been placed there even remained overnight.
Since the slot in this letterbox was large and unsecured, not only staff but also visitors to the service would have had the opportunity to take bids received and, if necessary, to manipulate them.
New York
No deficiencies were complained about on the Czech side.
Summary findings
During the tender phase, contacts between interested companies and professionals involved in the procurement process will be prevented in particular in both countries.
Furthermore, by providing all bidders with the same information, the principle of equal treatment should be respected.
The regulations on the receipt, safekeeping and confidentiality of the offers appear to be suitable to counteract manipulation and corruption.
The corresponding requirements in Germany are somewhat more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
The results of the investigation in Germany have revealed breaches of the rules in some areas.
These shortcomings could be remedied with little effort.
Opening up the offers
Opening up the offers
During the opening date, the previously closed offers will be opened and their contents read out and thus made known.
From the opening date, bidders are bound by their bids until the end of the award period set by the contracting authority.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
There are no separate EU legal provisions for the opening up of the offers.
However, for this highly sensitive phase of the procurement process, the national anti-corruption rules contain extensive requirements to protect bids and competition.
The multi-eye principle as well as the transparency and traceability of the offer opening are intended to prevent manipulation and changes to the submitted offers.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
The opening date is to be carried out by several persons to be determined by the registry.
The multi-eye principle is intended to prevent individuals from being able to manipulate the offers in an uncontrolled manner when opening the offers.
In most procurement procedures, bidders can participate in the opening date.
Only bids submitted to the negotiator at the time of the opening of the first offer are allowed to open.
In principle, offers received late may no longer be taken into account.
In order to ensure the transparency of the opening date, the actions taken and the results of the opening of the offer shall be recorded in a protocol which shall include, inter alia, the names of the bidders and the offer prices.
The minutes are to be read out and signed by the head of the negotiations.
It can also be signed by the bidders present.
Different rules
In the Czech Republic, a committee is conducting the opening of tenders.
Freelancers can also participate in this process.
The Committee may also be charged with other phases of the award procedure, such as the evaluation of tenders.
In Germany, a negotiator and a secretary carry out the opening of the offer.
The chief negotiator must be an official of the tendering body.
The negotiator and, in the case of contracts in building construction, also the secretary shall not be involved in the processing of the award documents as well as in the award and execution of the contract.
According to the German regulations, the minutes of the opening date must contain not only the offer prices, but also information on discounts and discounts, as well as special features such as damaged or late offers.
In the Czech Republic, in addition to the offer price, only the language of the offer and the applicant's authority to sign are recorded.
The German regulations stipulate that the open offers must be marked in all parts in such a way that subsequent changes and additions are prevented.
The offers are usually marked by perforations with the date of the opening date. They are to be kept secret after the opening date and may only be made available to the persons directly responsible for processing them.
There are no corresponding Czech regulations.
If only one offer is received in an award procedure in the Czech Republic, it may not be opened and must be returned unvalued.
There is no such regulation in Germany. If only one offer is received here, it is to be opened and then evaluated.
Key audit results
BRH.
Multi-eye principle
The audited contracting authorities implemented the requirements for the multi-eye principle at the opening dates.
They carried out the opening dates with negotiators and secretaries who were not in charge of any other procurement procedures.
In the case of freelance contracts with a smaller scope of services, however, there were isolated cases in which freelancers opened offers sent to them without the involvement of the contracting authority.
Minutes
In the minutes of the opening dates, the opening of the offers was not always fully documented.
In some cases, for example, late tenders were not registered, and in some cases signatures were even missing.
Marking of the offers
The contracting authorities examined as part of the cross-sectional audit marked the bids in accordance with the specifications by perforating them with the date of the opening date.
More recent audits of some beneficiaries have found inadequate labelling.
However, these contracting authorities changed their labelling practice after the complaint by the BRH.
New York
Offer deadline
With regard to the award of road maintenance measures, an offer was not received by the contracting authority until one month after the end of the offer period. Nevertheless, the contracting authority accepted this offer.
Summary findings
The regulations of both countries for the opening of the bids agree in significant parts. They take into account both the principle of multi-eyes and the principle of transparency. Thus, the risks of corruption and manipulation in the opening of the bids can be substantially limited.
The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
In particular, the requirements for the precise documentation of the procedure as well as for the marking, safe storage and confidentiality of the offers significantly limit the possibilities for manipulation, such as subsequent changes to the offers.
In addition, those entrusted with the opening of tenders may not perform any other tasks in connection with the service to be awarded.
All in all, only a few complaints prove the high acceptance of the requirements for the opening of the offer.
Review and evaluation of the offers
Review and evaluation of offers The client shall examine and evaluate the offers available at the opening date.
It shall determine the tender for the award of the contract which best meets the requirements in accordance with the given award criteria.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
The EU benchmarks provide for a multi-stage procedure:
First of all, the suitability of the bidders must be established.
Bidders must be economically and financially capable and have the necessary professional and technical expertise.
Companies which, for example, have a final conviction for bribery or fraud are to be excluded from participation in the award procedure.
The bids of the not excluded bidders are to be examined mathematically, technically and economically and evaluated on the basis of the previously announced award criteria.
The client has to determine the most economically advantageous offer. Offers with unusually low prices have to be examined by the client in particular.
The examination and evaluation of tenders is a particularly manipulation-prone phase of the award procedure.
For example, bidders may be unjustifiably excluded or offers that do not meet the requirements may be left in competition.
By favouring or disadvantaging bidders, the evaluation result can be impermissibly impaired and thus the identification of the most economically advantageous offer can be prevented.
The contracting authority must therefore take special precautions to ensure that the persons in charge of the audit and evaluation meet the requirements of integrity and expertise.
It must also ensure the transparency and traceability of the procedure and of the decisions taken.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
In line with EU requirements, bids in both countries are to be assessed and evaluated in a multi-stage process.
The requirements for the companies "proof of suitability to be submitted as well as the award criteria to be taken into account in the evaluation and their weighting are laid down in the notices or in the award documents and cannot be changed during the procedure.
Once the suitability of the bidder has been checked, the suitability criteria may no longer be used in the evaluation of the bids.
The evaluation shall be limited to the award criteria.
The tenders submitted must first be formally examined immediately as to whether they are complete and whether they contain, for example, abnormalities that could indicate possible intentions to manipulate them.
If bidders are excluded from further examination and evaluation of their offers, they shall be informed of this without delay.
If the valuation of the bids results in an unreasonably low price, the bidder must be given the opportunity to comment before a possible exclusion of his bid.
The decisions made during the examination and evaluation of the offers must be documented in a comprehensible manner.
Different rules
In Germany, the offers to be kept secret may only be made available to the persons directly responsible for processing them.
Only the registry may carry out the review of the bids and the computational examination of the bids.
It shall only appoint officials who are not involved in the award decision or in the implementation of the measure.
The performance of further examination and evaluation tasks is not regulated in more detail.
If freelancers are commissioned with the examination and evaluation, they have to treat the offers confidentially.
They may only make proposals for the decisions to be taken by the contracting authorities.
In the Czech Republic, award committees are to be set up to examine and evaluate tenders.
The committees draw up evaluation reports with award proposals.
In the end, as in Germany, only the contracting authorities have to decide on the award of contracts.
If evidence or declarations required for the submission of a bid in Germany are only partially submitted, the registry shall give the bidders the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.
Only if the documents are still not available after the deadline, the offer is to be excluded from the valuation.
In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the contracting authority whether to give tenderers the opportunity to complete missing evidence or declarations.
If a bidder fails to do so, he must be excluded.
In Germany, in addition to the total price, the standard prices (prices for partial services) of the offers must also be examined.
If, as a result of the price structure of the offer, there are indications that prices for partial services are set too low or too high, the bidder is to be asked to remove these ambiguities.
If it does not succeed in this and the registry can provide proof of a mixed calculation of the prices, this offer is to be excluded.
This is to prevent bidders from speculating in the calculation of their offer on significant changes in the volume of partial services, which can result in significant increases in the costs of the construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, the total price is assessed, but not the adequacy of the prices for partial services.
A mixed calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.
Bids with unreasonably high or low prices may not be awarded in Germany.
If one or more offers fall short of the applicable price calculation of the principal or the bid totals of the other bidders by 10% or more, the bidders shall prove the correct calculation of their offers.
If they are unable to do so, the contracting authority may exclude the offers in question.
In the Czech Republic, the call for tenders may be withdrawn after a cost-effectiveness assessment if only tenders with unjustifiable low prices are available.
In contrast to German public procurement law, tenders with prices substantially higher than the client's calculation cannot be refused for this reason.
If there is suspicion of anti-competitive behaviour in Germany, the contracting authority must immediately report to its specialist supervisory authority at the leading level.
It will have to decide what measures to take and whether to inform the antitrust authority or the public prosecutor's office.
For example, if a contract is to be awarded freely, if a contract is not to be awarded to the tender with the lowest price, or if the call for tenders is to be rescinded, the specialist supervisory authority at the leading level must also give its consent for works over 50,000 euros.
There are no such rules in the Czech Republic.
Key audit results
BRH.
Suitability and scoring criteria
The vast majority of audited procurement procedures were in line with the requirements set out above.
In the case of some companies proposed by freelancers, contracting authorities did not check the suitability of the companies themselves.
A grant recipient commissioned companies without the required proof of suitability being available in full.
In some cases, it was not clear whether the contracting authority had taken into account all the published award criteria in its selection decision or whether it had based its award decision solely on the criterion of "price."
Selection of the persons involved and confidentiality of the offers
Some contracting authorities used persons who were not authorised to do so in the examination of tenders.
For example, freelancers or employees of the department involved in the planning or execution of a construction project carried out tasks that could only be performed by employees of the contracting authority.
The construction services justified this on the grounds of insufficient staff capacity in the respective areas.
In some cases, the freelancers commissioned to examine the offers also included employees who were not obliged to maintain the confidentiality of the offers and to diligently fulfil their contractual obligations.
For the construction services it was in most cases also not comprehensible whether the offers of the freelancers were only accessible to the persons directly commissioned with the processing.
Review and accounting review of the offers
Some contracting authorities handed over the opened offers to freelancers for further examination without first having carried out the prescribed review of the offers and the computational examination themselves and having documented their results.
In the event of manipulative intentions, third parties could have made changes to the bids without this being comprehensible to the contracting authorities.
In the examined documents, abnormalities or missing price or product information were partially not or only insufficiently marked.
Performance audits
In a sample in a building administration, in three quarters of the procurement procedures examined, the most favourable offers deviated more than 10% from the estimated costs previously determined.
One out of every 20 procurement procedures has been cancelled because of inappropriate offer prices.
Not all bid reviews and clarification discussions with the bidders were comprehensible or sufficiently documented.
In many cases there was a lack of further clarification, such as on the unit prices of the most important items.
Frequently, the deviations were justified only across the board, for example by indications of changed market prices or increased material costs.
The building services said it was difficult to identify and prove mixed calculations.
In the case of a call for tenders by a public institution, the offer price of the most favourable offer was 66% below the previously determined estimated value of these services.
Further calculation checks or investigations into the causes of this deviation were not documented.
In a fact-finding meeting, the contracting authority found no evidence of price dumping by the then contracted company.
This left it unclear whether the estimated value was excessive or whether the offer price was too low.
Later, the client assessed the contracted company as a "low-cost company" that could not maintain quality or deadlines.
In another call for tenders, a construction agency awarded the contract to a tender whose price was 35% higher than the value of the cost assessment.
It did not annul the call for tenders, citing the irrelevant reasoning that an adequate calculation could be concluded in the case of that company.
Suspicion of irregularities
In an audited building management, there were two cases of irregularities, both of which were reported to the specialist supervisory level.
In one of the cases, the calculation of two bidders in a tender was identical, so that the contracting authority excluded both bids from the procedure.
In the application of the other regulations, the tests did not give rise to any significant objections.
New York
Aptitude test
In many of the construction projects examined, including higher education, road construction and the extension of the rail network, contracting authorities did not exclude tenderers from the procedure even though they did not meet the requirements set out in the tender documents or could not prove their suitability to the prescribed extent. On the other hand, in one case a contracting authority could neither prove nor explain why it had excluded a tenderer who had met the requirements.
Scoring
When awarding construction services for a water treatment plant, the contracting authority did not take the given evaluation criteria into account when examining and evaluating the bids.
In the case of a construction project for the expansion of the rail network, the awarding authority determined the weighting of the evaluation criteria only at the beginning of the evaluation.
In the case of road maintenance measures, the given criterion of "shortening the construction phase" was incorrectly evaluated in a procedure.
As a result, the bidders in second and third position did not take sufficient account of the reduction offered.
Documentation of the selection of offers
In three tendering procedures within the framework of the housing promotion, the contracting authority did not document which criteria it had applied and on what basis it had selected the successful bidder.
When building a motorway, the contracting authority selected the companies for smaller orders of up to 20,000 euros solely on the basis of telephone surveys on prices and delivery conditions.
Tests of this selection were not possible because the surveys were not documented.
Summary findings
The regulations for the examination and evaluation of the offers correspond in both countries to the requirements of the EU.
However, when it comes to details of the procedure and the selection of the persons involved, the respective regulations differ.
In Germany, the procedure is regulated to a greater extent than in the Czech Republic due to detailed requirements, in particular for the implementation of the multi-eyes principle and for the protection of offers.
The same applies to the requirements on the basis of which the adequacy of the prices offered is to be assessed.
In both countries, in some of the procurement procedures examined, it was found that significant procedural steps in the examination and evaluation of tenders were not or only insufficiently documented.
Without traceability and transparency of the examination and evaluation decisions, however, possible manipulative interventions are favoured.
A particularly serious defect was the handing over of all tenders to third parties without the contracting authority having sufficiently reviewed and documented the tenders in advance, thereby protecting them from possible manipulation in the further proceedings.
If contracting authorities have tasks performed by third parties in the examination and evaluation of tenders, sufficient precautions and increased control efforts are required in order to counter the increased risk of manipulation.
When assessing the adequacy of prices, the audited services in Germany did not always make full use of the available instruments and did not adequately examine the price structure of the offers.
In the Czech Republic, complaints arose in particular with regard to the aptitude test and the application of the evaluation criteria.
Completion of the award procedure
After examining and valuing the bids, the award procedure will be concluded by awarding the contract or by cancelling the procedure.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
In the case of EU-wide tendering procedures, all tenderers must be informed in advance of the planned award decision.
Companies have the possibility to verify the intended award within 10 days if notified electronically or by fax, or within 15 days for other means of communication, and, if necessary, to initiate a review procedure.
A contract may not be concluded before the expiry of this information period.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFT blank
If a bidder submits a request for review within the information period, it is only possible to conclude a contract after the final decision in the review procedure.
Companies can also have the award decision reviewed by an independent court as part of this review procedure.
The purpose of the review procedure is to ensure the legal protection of companies and to encourage the contracting authority to comply with public procurement law throughout the award procedure.
To do so, he must sufficiently document the procedure.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have implemented EU rules on information and verification procedures.
In both countries, the awarding authority has to decide on the award of the contract.
However, it must not deviate arbitrarily from the result of a proper examination and evaluation of the offers.
The contracting authority shall award the contract within the announced award period,
also because the bidders are no longer bound by their offers after the deadline.
In the case of open and non-open procedures or public and restricted tenders, the client may in principle not deviate from the content of the offer when concluding the contract.
The losing bidders must be informed promptly of the award decision and of the reasons for not taking their bids into account.
Procurement procedures may only be revoked under certain conditions, for example if the bid prices are excessive or the bids do not meet the requirements of the tender.
Different rules
In the Czech Republic, the obligation to inform and wait for 10 or 15 days prior to the award of the contract also applies to works that are not to be awarded throughout Europe.
In Germany, these requirements apply only to the area of EU-wide contracts.
For the other procedures in Germany, bidders can only be informed of the award decision after the contract has been awarded.
In the Czech Republic, a tender procedure has to be terminated if only one bid has been received or only one bid could be evaluated.
In Germany, the contract must also be awarded in the case of only one valuable bid, provided that it complies with the conditions of the tender and is economical.
Key audit results
BRH.
In the case of the audited contracts, there were only a few complaints at the conclusion of the award procedures.
In some cases, EU-wide contracts were awarded to companies even before the information deadlines expired, which can lead to the ineffectiveness of the contract.
In individual cases, order letters according to open procedures also contained content that deviated from the content of the offer, such as changed dates.
In several cases, the contracting authorities did not respect the award deadlines.
In an open procedure, a contracting authority therefore awarded the contract to the second most favourable offer, since a company with a 50% lower offer was no longer prepared to carry out the services at the price originally offered after the award period had expired.
New York
In the case of a construction project in the higher education sector, the contracting authority deviated from the bidder's offer in terms of content.
For some contracts, for example for road maintenance works, the construction of a motorway and a bypass, the contracting authorities concluded the contracts after the expiry of the legal deadline.
When awarding works for the rehabilitation of former military sites, the contracting authority forwarded the notification of the award of the contract to all bidders only after the expiry of the statutory deadline.
Summary findings
Both countries have implemented the EU's requirements at the end of the procurement process.
The legal protection of the losing candidates or bidders will increase the tools for preventing corruption.
In Czech public procurement law, the scope of legal protection is also extended to contracts awarded below the EU thresholds.
Both countries have been found to have exceeded the deadlines for awarding contracts.
This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.
Public works authorities should avoid the shortcomings identified when concluding their procurement procedures in the future.
Documentation, reporting and reporting obligations
The award procedures must be documented in a comprehensible manner during their individual stages with regard to the relevant findings as well as the reasons for the individual decisions.
In EU-wide procedures, the contracts awarded must be made public.
The order data will also be recorded in EU statistics.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption The documentation of procurement procedures implements a fundamental requirement of the EU-wide transparency requirement.
Carefully and promptly prepared documentation only makes it possible to trace the award decisions.
In particular, it also provides effective legal protection for tenderers in the case of contracts awarded above the EU thresholds.
Proper documentation is also an essential part of preventing corruption, as the compulsion to give detailed reasons for awarding contracts considerably restricts the scope for manipulation.
The notification of a contract awarded in an EU-wide procurement procedure must be sent by the relevant contracting authority to the Office for Official Publications of the EU within 48 days.
The Office publishes the notices in the Official Journal of the EU and thus also implements the transparency requirement.
The contracting authorities must also collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and report them to the EU Commission via the relevant national ministries.
On this basis, the EU Commission produces annual EU statistics, through which it can obtain an overview of the development of the internal market in construction services.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have fully transposed EU legislation on documentation and reporting requirements into national law.
The rules on documentation and reporting for EU statistics are broadly the same in both countries.
Different rules
In the Czech Republic, the obligation to publish contracts awarded is not limited to EU-wide contracts, but also extends to the other award procedures.
The notice period is shortened to 15 days.
In Germany, in addition to EU-wide awards, there is an obligation to publish only in the case of restricted invitations to tender and in the case of hands-free awards above value limits of 25,000 euros or 15,000 euros without value added tax (so-called ex-post transparency).
Below these limits, as well as in the case of public tenders, only the companies involved in the competition procedure will receive information on the award of contracts.
Key audit results
BRH.
Documentation
A large number of the audited procurement procedures were not fully documented.
The award notes did not contain all the necessary information, such as the justification of product specifications or references to national rules.
In a procurement procedure, the contracting authority did not justify why it awarded the contract to a company, even though its offer did not contain mandatory evidence.
In a few cases, the documents of the contracting authorities did not contain all the evidence required for the documentation of the award procedure.
Notices on award of contracts
In some EU-wide procurement procedures, contracting authorities failed to publicise the award of contracts.
Further procurement procedures failed to provide evidence that the contracting authorities had made public the contracts awarded.
Reporting and reporting obligations
The statistical statements viewed contained the required minimum information. They had been prepared and sent on time.
Ex-post transparency
In most cases, the audited construction authorities published the contract data of the completed procurement procedures.
However, a construction management company did not publish this data due to a transmission error.
The building management only noticed this error after half a year,
so that the contract data of the procurement procedures completed up to that date have not been published.
New York
Documentation
There were considerable shortcomings in the documentation of the awarding procedures for the construction of a major sporting event, mainly due to incorrect information, such as incorrect bid prices in the minutes of the valuation committees.
In addition, some minutes of the opening of the offer were not signed.
Notices on award of contracts
In the case of several road projects, procurement notices have been published only late or not at all.
Summary findings
The regulations on documentation and reporting and reporting requirements are broadly in line in both countries and implement the EU requirements.
This will, in principle, ensure the transparency of procurement procedures, including the awarding of contracts.
The rules to be applied in the Czech Republic for notification go a little further than the requirements in Germany.
The shortcomings identified in the documentation and in the notices partially significantly limited the anti-corruption effect of these instruments in the respective procurement procedures.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFT blank
Public works administrations should further improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and award of contracts and fully comply with their reporting and reporting obligations.
Summary evaluation and recommendations
The parallel audits carried out by NKÚ and BRH have focused on two main areas which are essential for the award of works by contracting authorities in the Czech Republic and Germany: the application of EU public procurement rules and the prevention of corruption.
The requirements of EU law allow for cross-border competition to create a single European market.
Anti-corruption measures are not only intended to prevent or at least reduce corruption; they are also intended to prevent economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the state.
The audit findings of the two courts of auditors on the application of public procurement rules in both countries, as well as the comparison of these rules, reveal similarities and differences which may help both countries in the further development of their public procurement law and its application.
Application of EU public procurement rules
The EU requirements for the award of works have been transposed into national law by both countries.
This provides an important common basis in the Czech Republic and Germany for the award of works and for taking into account the essential requirements of competition, equal treatment of the companies involved and transparency of procurement procedures.
The building administrations of both countries have underpinned these bids in part very extensively by further administrative regulations.
The Czech Republic has to a large extent also transferred the requirements for works to be awarded across the EU to its nationally regulated procurement procedures below the EU threshold.
However, the Court of Auditors' investigations have shown that public works administrations have not fully complied with the requirements of EU law in all areas.
The construction administration in Germany should further improve the quality of its procurement procedures in order to be able to eliminate the objections raised when implementing the EU requirements.
In particular, the audits carried out in the Czech Republic have highlighted risks affecting the economic viability of the award of contracts.
For example, incomplete service descriptions necessitated additional services, which were often awarded in violation of legal provisions. Furthermore, cost calculations were often insufficiently prepared. Excessive qualification requirements also reduced the number of potential bidders and restricted competition, particularly in the case of transport construction.
Prevention of corruption
The investigations were not aimed at uncovering cases of corruption,
also because the courts of auditors do not have the tools to do so.
The Court of Auditors can, however, examine the extent to which the administrations of both countries have taken precautions against corruption and manipulation in the award of works and how these requirements are applied.
The two countries have different priorities when it comes to preventing corruption.
In particular, the German regulations provide for largely unrestricted competition as well as transparency and controls as central elements of the prevention of corruption.
The main aim of the Czech regulations is to increase the transparency of procedures.
BRH.
In Germany, general principles of corruption prevention apply, which must be applied by the entire federal administration.
These principles are also implemented in the specifications for the award of construction services and are geared to their specific requirements.
In some cases, the relevant regulations specify very precisely how the bids to prevent corruption are to be taken into account in the course of the award procedures and in the selection of the persons involved.
In the opinion of the BRH, in particular, the primacy of the principle of open procedure or public tendering is an appropriate instrument for substantially reducing the risk of corruption in the award of works. Restrictions on competition, on the other hand, increase the risk of manipulative interference.
Risk analyses and adequate controls (in particular the multi-eye principle), the requirements for transparency and documentation of award procedures as well as various organisational measures are also effective measures to prevent corruption and manipulation.
The BRH therefore sees no need for fundamental changes to the corresponding requirements of the administrations in the award of construction services.
The rules to prevent corruption are largely taken into account in practice.
The shortcomings identified in some areas have highlighted shortcomings in the implementation of some of the targets.
The building authorities should further train their staff on the prevention of corruption and make them even more aware of this problem.
A substantial part of the complaints related to tasks delegated by the building authorities to freelancers.
Without controls and adequate safeguards, however, the risk of abuse increases when delegating tasks.
Tasks at risk of manipulation and corruption should therefore only be entrusted to third parties if the administration can guarantee a sufficient level of protection against undue interference.
New York
The Czech Republic adopted an anti-corruption strategy at government level, in which the area of public procurement is the most important element.
The Public Procurement Act and its implementing provisions have been substantially amended.
The audits of the NKÚ took place during the implementation of this strategy.
The strategy adopted and the new legislation should be effective improvement measures, as contracting authorities will have to justify the cost-effectiveness of awarding contracts, the calculation of expected prices, the adequacy of qualification requirements, the essential evaluation criteria and the nature of the evaluations, and properly document and publish all these aspects.
The recommendations
The NKÚ and BRH take a generally positive view of the implementation of the EU requirements.
The widespread acceptance in practice has confirmed that the EU's requirements of competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for the award of works within the European Union.
The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at enabling and promoting cross-border competition.
In view of the enormous material and non-material damage potential caused by manipulation and corruption in the award of construction services, both courts of auditors see the construction administrations in their countries as being called upon to continue and, if necessary, to improve their measures against corruption and manipulation.
In particular, the organisation and procedures of procurement procedures should be continuously examined for weaknesses and risks in order to identify the need for action and to take appropriate countermeasures.
The comparison of procurement practices in both countries suggests that the share of open procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased, as open procedures offer a wider scope for competition and can significantly reduce the risk of corruption.
A greater division of works into lots can also have a favourable effect on offer prices, provided that it leads to greater competition with a higher number of bidders.
Ensuring the correct implementation of procurement procedures is an essential basis for the efficient procurement activities of contracting authorities.
In Germany, the procurement procedures are carried out by specialised construction authorities. In the Czech Republic, however, these tasks - with the exception of transport projects - are carried out by the departments themselves or by contractors commissioned by them.
The aim of the Courts of Auditors of both countries, even after the completion of their joint project, is to further develop the findings that are important to them and, if necessary, to pass them on to the parliament and government of their country.
Both Courts of Auditors are also convinced that the principles of public procurement law set out in this report and its implementation are also of interest at international level to the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), because the principles and findings set out are of general importance in order to effectively combat corruption and to ensure the economic award of works in a well-functioning and fair competition.

Football: Juve coach praises Ronaldo's best game after top-flight match
According to Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri, the Portuguese star striker "played the best game of the evening together with the half-hour of Valencia," after the record-breaking champions "3-1 win over Napoli.
For the coach, even without an own goal, the expensively purchased star was the decisive man in the important match against the chasing pack.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is doing well," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good with our first goal - and from that moment on we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three assists, Juve turned the game around after falling behind early on through a goal from Dries Mertens in the 10th minute and hung on for the time being.
The scorer, brought in from Real Madrid, first laid on former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double (26 / 49).
And Ronaldo's header from a corner also set up a goal for defender Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who only had to push in just before the goal-line.
"He gives a lot of assists," praised the coach.
But Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record goalscorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We need to get even better at serving him," the coach said.
Currently Juve's top scorer is Mandzukic with four goals - Ronaldo has three to his name.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the superiority of Juventus seems to become even more overwhelming.

Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Celebrity guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy of Tutzing offers about 80 conferences until the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signalled that he will personally pick up the Tolerance Prize in Tutzing.
The term of office was too short for Christian Wulff: As Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after Wulff was there as a guest.
This is how Academy Director Udo Hahn counted him when he proudly said: "All Federal Presidents and Federal Chancellors have already been with us." However, the fact that celebrities keep turning up at the Academy in Schloss Tutzing was also a topic during the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, singer-songwriter Konstantin Wecker will take part in a conference on spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective, and on 29 September the writer Frido Mann will attend a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has also confirmed that he will personally accept the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which will also be awarded to television presenter Dunja Hayali in another category (as we reported).

Music Cabaret: Gender Understanding with the Heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
The musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck was "suitable for both adults and men."
As a cabaret performer, Teubner buttoned up gender understanding, not only with humour and warmth of heart for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and whatever else there might be, but also with music.
She used the mini-guitar and also mastered her violin.
At the grand piano sat Ben Süverkrüp.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes speaks right up to the end of the movement, and on the other, he is a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner accompanies with such congenial harmony that some may have wished for a solo.
There was, too, with Beethoven and Chopin, but in a different way, in the way that suited the theme of the evening.
Teubner had brought a paradox into play: the satisfaction in a man comes when he has a partner, but she does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, is of no use.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: what would have emerged from Mozart's composing if "das Nannerl" had unexpectedly opened the door?
Thus Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" into the "Lied vom Tod," and from Mozart's Symphony in G minor into a playful little dance.
There was a huge round of applause and "Bravo" from the packed hall.
Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, presented flowers to the chansonette.
But chairwoman Heidemarie Markenbeck did not let herself be deprived of an additional thanks.

Administration of VAT in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Report on the audit
Preface
Taxes are the main source of revenue for the public purse.
A focus of the work of the Court of Auditors should therefore be on auditing this area.
This applies in particular to VAT fraud.
This alone causes an estimated €100 billion in lost tax revenue in the European Union every year1.
Already at the VI EUROSAI Congress 2005 in Bonn, the participants pointed out the need for enhanced cooperation.
This allows the courts of auditors, for example, to exchange audit approaches and to optimise audit practice.
The value added tax (VAT) is particularly suitable for cooperation, as it is harmonised within the European Union.
In 2006, the Courts of Auditors of both States audited in parallel for the first time in the field of VAT.
The corresponding audit report was published in 2008.
Since VAT fraud is a widespread phenomenon in the European Union, there is a need for close cooperation between the courts of auditors, so that it can be fully assessed whether the measures taken are appropriate to combat VAT fraud effectively.
The two courts of auditors decided to continue their cooperation and carried out a second parallel audit. Administration of VAT in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany Report on the audit
1st Introduction
Examination number: (CZ) 09 / 11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892
Subject of audit: (CZ) Administration of VAT (D) Bilateral audit with the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic (hereinafter NKÚ), audit
Objective of the test:
(CZ) The administration of VAT and the treatment of selected transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as CZ) and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter referred to as Germany) should be examined, as well as the procedures used by the tax authorities in intergovernmental mutual assistance.
(D) The purpose of the audit was to evaluate how the financial administration has implemented the recommendations made by the courts of auditors.
In addition, further audit fields associated with the VAT should be processed.
The findings should be compared in order to determine whether taxation procedures can be optimised.
The audit period covered the years 2006 to 2008, including relevant information from the period before the audit period until the completion of the audit.
2. Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel examination
The Courts of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have agreed on a control audit for the administration of VAT.
In the previous parallel investigation, they had identified suspected cases of intra-Community transactions,
which made a re-examination seem appropriate.
On the basis of the audit findings, the two Court of Auditors made recommendations on the management of VAT.
The aim of the control audit was to evaluate how these recommendations were implemented and to investigate the suspected cases identified.
The audit also dealt with other matters, including selected cases of high-risk intra-Community transactions, mutual assistance in the recovery of VAT receivables and the VAT audit of large enterprises.
The Court of Auditors found that:
1. Recommendations made on the basis of previous examination
• Recommendation 1: The rules for the registration of taxable persons should be harmonised within the EU
In the first audit, the Court of Auditors compared the VAT registration procedures in the two states and found differences that caused problems.
The Court of Auditors therefore recommended harmonising the registration of taxable persons within the EU.
This has also been taken up at EU level.
The draft amendment to Council Regulation No 1798 / 2003 provides for the extension of the current databases in the EU, including a database containing the identification number of the persons subject to VAT.
The draft also provided for common rules for the registration of taxable persons and their possible cancellation.
The Court of Auditors expected Member States, in line with their decision in principle, to agree on appropriate arrangements to remove unreliable traders from the VAT system as early as possible.
The Member States reached political agreement in ECOFIN on the latest version of the draft.
The above-mentioned common rules are no longer included in it, and the two courts of auditors regret this.
They continue to believe that such arrangements are important in order to prevent VAT fraud.
• Recommendation 2: Monthly submission of the Summary Reports As a result of the initial audit, the Court of Auditors recommended to the Member States that in future the Summary Reports (ZM) should be submitted monthly.
The amounts of intra-Community transactions could then be reviewed in a more timely manner.
Council Directive 2008 / 117 / EC amending Directive 2006 / 112 / EC on the common system of value added tax (VAT) for the purpose of combating tax fraud in respect of intra-Community transactions has reduced the deadline for the submission of customs duties to one month.
In the Czech Republic, this requirement was implemented by an amendment to the VAT Act that came into force on January 1, 2010.
In Germany, the transposition only came into force on 1 July 2010. It has thus failed to transpose the obligation to submit the ZM on a monthly basis into national law in due time.
• Recommendation 3: Data comparison of the VAT pre-declarations and the ZM in Germany for more reliable MIAS data and proposal to examine the merging of the procedures for VAT pre-declarations and ZM The German tax administration has taken up the recommendation made by the Federal Audit Office and set up a working group to work out possible solutions.
The work is not yet complete.
The Federal Audit Office will monitor further developments.
• Recommendation 4: Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level During the first audit, the two Court of Auditors agreed that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by one Member State alone.
Successful criteria as well as elements or approaches of a risk management system must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State.
If this is not done, fraudsters will focus on the Member State with the weakest risk management system.
The Court of Auditors found that the two Member States apply different risk management systems, which have both strengths and weaknesses.
The NKU examined the system of information exchange within the EU - EUROCANET, while the Federal Audit Office focused on Germany's participation in the "Platform for Risk Management."
2. Audit of selected intra-Community transactions
During the first audit, the Courts of Auditors jointly examined transactions for which it was doubtful whether they had actually been carried out or which had been declared differently by the taxpayers of the two States in the VAT pre-declarations (or VAT declarations) or ZM.
The Court of Auditors selected nine cases of intra-Community deliveries of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany for the audit.
The audits by the tax offices (FÄ) of both states had not yet been completed when the first parallel audit was completed.
The audit showed that the tax procedures relating to these selected transactions had now been completed and appropriate measures had been taken by the respective tax administrations (including ex-post fixing of VAT or the prevention of input tax refunds).
3. Examination of selected, particularly risky intra-Community transactions
The audit also included high-risk intra-EU transactions between taxpayers in the EU covered by the EUROCANET system.
EUROCANET is used to identify high-risk taxpayers.
Member States may participate in this scheme on a voluntary basis.
The CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET. Germany has a passive status, i.e. it does not participate in data exchange within the framework of EUROCANET.
From the point of view of an active participating state, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to participate actively.
As a result, no information could be obtained as to which suppliers with German VAT ID would have been classified as high-risk cases.
The NKU found both normal transactions and those suspected of VAT fraud, including carousel fraud, in the selected transactions.
The FÄ were only able to audit high-risk transactions to a limited extent, particularly in the case of so-called "missing traders," whereby an audit of the documents alone is hardly sufficient to prove fraud to the taxpayer.
In case of suspected carousel fraud on imports and exports
it is recommended that customs and tax authorities work more closely together in order to track the identity of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final customer.
Germany and a number of other countries have rejected active participation in EUROCANET on the grounds that, in their view, there is not a sufficient legal basis.
The Federal Audit Office found that the German tax administration uses other instruments to identify high-risk taxpayers.
Nevertheless, there is a need for communication and exchange of experience between all EU Member States.
The Council of the EU agreed on a draft Regulation,
was created by the EUROFISC.
The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should feed into the planned network for the fight against VAT fraud.
4. Mutual assistance in the recovery of claims
Intergovernmental mutual assistance in the recovery of claims is subject to the same European legislation in all Member States.
Therefore, requests for intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic and Germany will be handled in the same way.
The Federal Audit Office and the NKU compared the statistics sent to the European Commission by both Member States for the years 2006 to 2008.
There were inconsistencies in these statistics.
The two Court of Auditors consider it useful to have a renewed discussion on statistics at EU level in order to avoid any remaining discrepancies in the future.
If this does not happen, the statistics cannot be used properly for comparisons.
In addition, the statistics should contain more information on VAT.
An analysis of detailed data can make it easier for the Commission to support Member States in their efforts to combat VAT fraud.
Both Court of Auditors consider that Member States with a low recovery rate should strive to achieve at least the average recovery rate.
The Commission should support the Member States in this, if so desired.
5. VAT-testing at large companies
The Court of Auditors analysed the legal situation with regard to the VAT audit of large companies in both states.
In addition, they used a questionnaire to collect information from the financial administrations that they considered important in this context.
It became clear that the situation in both states is different.
The CZ has a system for the selection of high-risk cases that includes a large amount of relevant data (including information on VAT audits, balance sheet data and profit and loss accounts).
The overall control of VAT can thus be effectively controlled and analysed.
A special tax office for large companies is to be set up in 2012.
Germany does not yet have a comparable system. This makes it more difficult to control and analyse VAT control as a whole.
The German tax administration focuses more on the selection of relevant individual cases and relies in particular on data from the VAT pre-declarations or VAT declarations and the ZM.
Various risk management components, which are to be improved, support the evaluation of this data.
3. Test procedure
3.1 Examination procedure in the Czech Republic
Department II - State Budget Revenue as well as Regional Departments IX Pilsen, X České Budějovice, XIII Brno and XV Ostrava audited from May 2009 to February 2010.

The Senate of the Czech Court of Auditors approved the audit findings on 27 April 2010.
3.2 Examination procedures in Germany
The audit area traffic taxes and employees of the associated PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt / Main and Munich audited from February 2009 to February 2010.
After selecting the sample cases, they announced the review in several countries:
• Bavaria, • Hamburg, • Hessen, • North Rhine-Westphalia, • Saxony. In addition, they conducted interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance (Federal Ministry of Finance).
Tax files from the following cases were included in the audit: • Erlangen, Zentralfinanzamt München, Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; • Hamburg-Nord, Hamburg-Hansa, Sonderfinanzamt Hamburg für Großunternehmen; • Wiesbaden I, Wiesbaden II, Darmstadt; • Essen-NordOst, FA Essen for tax audits of large companies and corporations, Lüdenscheid; • Chemnitz-Süd.
In addition, discussions were held with the FÄ Mühlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Süd and the OFD Frankfurt / Main, Chemnitz and Münster.
The Federal Audit Office informed the Federal Ministry of Finance of the audit results in April 2010.
3.3 Cooperation between the two Courts of Auditors
In the run-up to the parallel audit, representatives of both courts met in September 2008 to discuss and define the audit topics.
In December 2008, the Presidents of both Courts of Auditors signed the Memorandum of Understanding on co-operation in parallel audit.
At a meeting in Bonn in June 2009, the examination teams briefed themselves on the initial results obtained in the preparation of the examination, discussed possible approaches to the examination and agreed on the way forward.
A second meeting took place in Prague from 2 to 4 December 2009.
The audit teams exchanged the audit findings and agreed on the timetable for the preparation of the joint audit report.
The two Courts of Auditors identified the following topics for their parallel audit: • Evaluation of the recommendations made in the previous report; • Review of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between CZ and German taxpayers which could not be fully clarified during the first parallel audit; • Review of selected intra-Community transactions between CZ and German taxpayers classified as risky; • Review of the procedures of the two tax administrations with regard to intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of VAT claims; • VAT audits of large companies.
The report on the results of the parallel audit was prepared during a working meeting in June 2010.
4. Audit of the administration of VAT in selected areas
4.1 Implementation of the recommendations of the first joint review
4.1.1 Implementation of the recommendations in the Czech Republic
Recommendation 1
Harmonisation of conditions for the registration of taxable persons within the EU Supported
On the basis of the results of the first audit, the Czech Court of Auditors recommended adjusting the requirements for VAT registration and introducing new rules for cancellation of registration in the Czech Republic.
These amended rules should be more effective in reducing the risk of possible tax evasion.
In certain cases, it was found that the FÄ did not cancel the VAT registration of taxable persons if they did not comply with their obligations under the Czech Law no. 235 / 2004 (hereinafter referred to as the "VAT Act").
So far, the Czech Ministry of Finance has not submitted an amendment to oblige the FÄ to cancel if taxpayers repeatedly fail to file VAT returns.
According to the Czech VAT Act, the FA may delete the registration of a taxable person ex officio if a) the taxable person has not carried out transactions for twelve consecutive months and has not informed the FA of the reasons for doing so; b) the taxable person has not fulfilled his obligations under the VAT Act; c) the taxable person no longer fulfils the requirements for the tax obligation.
The first audit showed that, according to the existing legal situation, FA Prague 1 must delete the VAT registration of "foreign taxpayers" 3 with effect from 31 January of the following calendar year if they were not obliged to declare and pay VAT in the current calendar year.
FA Prague 1 often did not delete the VAT registration of these taxpayers because the relevant provision of the deadline could not be adequately implemented in practice.
The problem was solved by the amendment of the VAT Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2009.
Accordingly, the FA is entitled to cancel the registration of a foreign taxable person if in the preceding calendar year he has provided neither taxable nor tax-exempt deliveries of goods or services entitled to deduction of VAT.
Recommendation 2
Monthly levy of the ZM
On the basis of the initial audit, the Court of Auditors had recommended the introduction of the monthly levy of ZM.
The Council Directive, which shortened the cycle of ZM delivery to one month, was implemented in the Czech Republic by the VAT Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.
The ZM must now be handed in electronically.
In addition, a ZM must be surrendered if services, the place of performance of which is to be determined in accordance with § 9 (1) VAT Act, are provided for a person registered as subject to VAT in another Member State.
This obligation arises from Council Directive 2008 / 8 / EC amending Directive 2006 / 112 / EC as regards the place of supply of services, provided that the recipient is obliged to declare and pay VAT on these services.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of the data of the VAT pre-declarations and the ZM in order to increase the reliability of the MIAS data This recommendation referred to the German tax administration.
In its ATIS4 system, the Czech Tax Administration automatically compares the data on intra-Community transactions from the VAT declarations and the ZM.
Recommendation 4
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level
The proper collection of VAT is a sine qua non for the proper functioning of the EU's internal market.
That is why the fight against VAT fraud is of primary interest and has received considerable attention in recent years.
The importance of this is demonstrated, among other things, by a study published by the European Commission in October 2009.
In it, an external expert estimated the VAT shortfall for the 25 Member States in the period 2000 to 2006. According to the analysis of the available data, the tax shortfall for that period was estimated at between 90 and 113 billion euros, based on the fact that the EU-25 loses an average of 12% of the turnover taxes due to them each year.
The estimated tax loss for the CZ in 2006 was 18%.
The first assessment found that a Member State cannot develop an effective risk management system (RMS) on its own.
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each Member State.
With regard to the RMS, the Czech Court of Auditors has audited the system for information exchange within the EU (EUROCANET).
Risky intra-Community transactions carried out by taxable persons within the EU and recorded in EUROCANET have been selected (see chapter 4.3).
The aim of the EUROFISC network is to optimise mutual assistance in tax matters and to combat VAT fraud more effectively, and to improve cooperation between the competent authorities in order to detect fraud as early as possible.
Later, EUROFISC could be used as a tool to assess the risk potential of intra-Community transactions.
The ECOFIN Council6 already approved EUROFISC on 7 October 2008 and at the same time adopted the principles for the functioning of the system.
EUROCANET, developed by the Belgian financial administration in cooperation with the other Member States and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF7, serves as a model for EUROFISC.
The purpose of the system is to detect high-risk transactions and to identify traders involved in organised VAT fraud.
4.1.2 Implementation of the recommendations in Germany
The assessment of the recommendations of the first report led to the following findings:
Recommendation 1
Harmonisation of the conditions for registration of taxable persons within the EU
On the basis of a detailed questionnaire, the German tax administration has developed a well-functioning system for the registration of taxpayers.
The Federal Ministry of Finance presented this system to the Commission in October 2007.
The system itself is constantly being improved.
The data provided in the questionnaire are now recorded electronically and are later available for research. They are therefore part of the risk management during registration.
The Commission had made a proposal 8 to amend Regulation 1798 / 2003, which provided, inter alia, for common standards for the registration and cancellation of taxable persons.
The Member States still needed to clarify and clarify this.
The Federal Audit Office had recommended to the Federal Ministry of Finance not to fall short of the standards already achieved.
Recommendation 2
Monthly levy of the ZM
On 8 April 2010, a law 9 transposing the EU directives into national law was passed.
It contains, inter alia, provisions on the monthly levy of the ZM for intra-Community supplies
and will enter into force on 1 July 2010.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of the data of the VAT pre-declarations and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and consideration of merging the previously separate procedures for the submission of the VAT pre-declarations and the ZM
A joint federal-state working group has been set up,
which has developed a concept for the automatic comparison of the data from the VAT pre-registrations and the ZM.
The concept is still being discussed with the countries.
In addition, this working party has worked on an approach to optimise the control procedure for intra-Community transactions.
Recommendation 4
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level At EU level, relevant information will be exchanged.
Germany is participating in the risk management platform.
The European Commission supported the initiative and initiated, by written procedure of 18 October 2006, the establishment of a Risk Management Platform within the Fiscalis 2006-2007 Action Plan.
The members of the Platform dealt with the following topics in 4 sub-groups: • Risk management tools, • Influencing the behaviour of taxpayers, • Evaluation, • Update of the Risk Management Guide.
New reports from the "Risk Management Instruments" and "Update of the Risk Management Guide" sub-groups were published in early 2010.
4.1.3 Evaluation
Registration
The issue of the conditions for VAT registration and its cancellation in different countries has been dealt with at EU level.
The draft amended Council Regulation 1798 / 2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT and repealing Regulation (EEC) 218 / 92 provides for the extension of the current databases within the EU, including a database of VAT identification numbers.
This proposal also includes common standards for the registration and cancellation of taxable persons.
For the time being, the issues of registration and deletion are reserved to the national legislation of the EU Member States.
The Member States still needed to clarify and clarify this.
The Federal Audit Office had recommended to the Federal Ministry of Finance not to fall behind the standards already achieved.
The Member States reached political agreement on the latest version of the draft in ECOFIN on 8 June 2010.
Common rules for the registration and cancellation of taxable persons are no longer included in it.

The two Courts of Auditors regret this, and they continue to believe that such regulations are important in order to prevent VAT fraud.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFT blank
Monthly levy of the ZM
With regard to international cooperation, as a result of the previous audit, it was recommended that all Member States introduce the monthly levy of the ZM in order to allow an earlier audit of the amounts of intra-Community transactions.
Council Directive 2008 / 117 / EC amending Directive 2006 / 112 / EC on the common system of value added tax (VAT) for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions has shortened the cycle for the submission of the relevant ZM to one month.
In the Czech Republic, this requirement was implemented by the amendment to the VAT Act, which came into force on 1 January 2010.
Germany did not implement the obligation to pay the monthly ZM levy until 1 July 2010 and thus did not meet the deadline, while the CZ complied with the EU requirements.
Comparison of the data of the VAT pre-declarations and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and considerations for merging the previously separate procedures for the submission of the VAT pre-declarations and the ZM
The German tax administration has taken up the recommendations of the Federal Audit Office and set up a working group to work out possible solutions.
The Federal Audit Office will monitor further developments.
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level
Germany and the Czech Republic use different approaches to identify high-risk entrepreneurs.
The Czech Court of Auditors audited the application of the EUROCANET system in CZ (see section 4.3).
The Federal Audit Office focused on the German participation in the risk management platform.
4.2 Control audit of selected intra-Community transactions
The first audit looked jointly at transactions where there were doubts as to whether they had actually been carried out or whether inconsistencies had been found in the declarations of taxable persons in both Member States.
The two Court of Auditors selected for the audit nine cases of intra-Community deliveries of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany where the tax audit by the FÄ of the Member State concerned had not yet been completed at the time of the previous joint audit.
1) Donald Trump
In the first quarter of 2005, a Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth EUR 22 686 from a German taxpayer.
The Czech taxable person did not declare the acquisition in his VAT declaration, because the German taxable person did not have a VAT identification number, but only a tax number for intra-German transactions.
Through international mutual assistance in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the competent Czech FA had received information that, according to German VAT law, the supplier of intra-Community goods does not need a VAT identification number in order to benefit from the tax exemption for intra-Community supplies of goods.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that, according to the audit carried out by the competent Czech FA, the Czech taxpayer submitted an additional VAT declaration in which he declared the purchase of goods of the above value and, at the same time, asserted his right to deduct the same amount of VAT.

A Czech taxpayer is alleged to have purchased goods worth EUR 12 561 from a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004.
However, he said he did not purchase the goods and therefore did not declare them in his VAT declaration.
The German tax administration, citing a provision of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, refused to process the request on the grounds that the turnover associated with the acquisition did not exceed the threshold of EUR 15 000.
As the Czech FA was unable to obtain documents, the tax audit was inconclusive and the original tax assessment remained in place.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech FA received two pieces of spontaneous information from Germany in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, according to which the German taxpayer had invoiced a Slovak addressee for the delivery of the goods in question.
The Czech taxpayer purchased the goods from the Slovak taxpayer and stated the purchase in his regular VAT declaration for the month of October 2004.
(3)
A Czech taxpayer is alleged to have purchased a car worth EUR 48 500 from a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004.
However, it did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.
In addition, he had not made a VAT declaration since August 2004. Therefore, the FA set the VAT for the quarter in question at CZK 0.
On the basis of information transmitted from Germany in the course of the international exchange of information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the FA requested the taxpayer to file a subsequent tax return in March 2007, but the taxpayer failed to do so.
The audit found that the FA had carried out further audit work in this tax case in 2007, finding that the car in question had been sold by the taxpayer to a second-hand car dealer in the Czech Republic.
The Czech FA carried out a tax assessment for the tax period December 2004, imposing an additional tax of CZK 295 379 on the purchase and resale of goods from another Member State.
The competent Czech court decided to open insolvency proceedings on the assets of the Czech taxpayer; an insolvency administrator was appointed.
In the absence of significant assets, the outstanding tax liability is likely to be non-recoverable.
4)
A Czech taxpayer is alleged to have delivered new vehicles (passenger cars) to Germany with a total value of EUR 198 167 in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005.
In response to a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, it was stated that tax criminal proceedings were pending against the German taxpayer in Germany.
The audit carried out by the Federal Audit Office showed that, at the end of the procedure, there was evidence that the German taxpayer was involved in fraud.
The intra-Community acquisition of goods was subject to acquisition taxation amounting to EUR 182 424 (for 2004) and EUR 369 690 (for 2005).
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors revealed that the Czech taxpayer was involved in carousel fraud involving new vehicles.
On the basis of information provided by the German tax administration, a VAT audit of the Czech taxpayer was carried out for the tax periods April, May and June 2005.
On the basis of the audit findings and information from the international exchange of information, the FA set additional VAT of CZK 703 031 for May 2005 and CZK 726 551 for June 2005.
5) Donald Trump
Czech taxpayer A is alleged to have purchased a machine with a total value of €58 000 from a German taxpayer in February 2005.
The German taxpayer is alleged to have supplied Czech taxpayer B with a machine worth EUR 88 027 in the third quarter of 2004. B, however, denied the purchase.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that B had purchased the machine from a German company established in the Czech Republic.
Czech taxable person A did not state the purchase of the goods from the said German taxable person in his VAT declaration.
The German FA's reply to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 showed that the German taxpayer had not made an intra-Community delivery of a machine worth €58 000, but a delivery within the Czech Republic.
In the audit, the Federal Audit Office found that the intra-Community supply of the machine was classified as a domestic supply after completion of an audit and that the VAT exemption was subsequently refused.
6) Donald Trump
A German taxpayer is alleged to have supplied goods worth EUR 11 600 to a Czech taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004.
The goods were purchased and later, in 2005, sold in Germany.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech FA had made its assessment on the basis of a supplementary VAT declaration which wrongly identified purchases from another Member State, including purchases in the above amount.
The Federal Audit Office found that, after receiving a reply to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the German FA corrected the VAT declaration of the German taxpayer and fixed an additional VAT of EUR 1 600.
Due to the resale of the goods in Germany and the corresponding VAT assessment there, an investigation is ongoing.
The ZM of the German taxable person has not yet been corrected, as in Germany only the taxable person who submitted the ZM can also correct it.
7) Donald Trump
The competent Czech FA received a request for information from the German tax administration in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 on the purchase of a car worth EUR 47 400 by a Czech taxpayer in February 2005.
Following an audit for the 2005 taxation period, the Czech FA fixed the tax liability of the Czech taxpayer at CZK 0 and informed the German FA that it could not confirm the purchase of the car by the Czech taxpayer.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors revealed that the registration of the Czech VAT payer had been cancelled because he had failed to comply with his tax obligations.
The Czech FA had forwarded the documents to the Czech police.
The German taxpayer has so far not corrected his information in the ZM, but has lodged an appeal against the tax decision.
8) Donald Trump
According to MIAS10, between the third quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, a German taxpayer supplied a Czech taxpayer with goods with a total value of EUR 33 205, which he did not declare to be an intra-Community acquisition.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors found that the Czech FA investigated the reasons for the discrepancies.
The Czech taxpayer made repeated subsequent VAT declarations for the first quarter of 2005.
However, the Czech FA was unable to clarify the difference in the amount of purchases amounting to CZK 134 273 in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005, on the grounds that sales for individual quarters could not be accurately allocated, and accepted the VAT declarations made.
9: 30 a.m.
A German taxpayer had delivered goods worth EUR 46 854 to a Czech taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004.
For the same period, the Czech taxable person declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only EUR 14 856.
In the framework of the intergovernmental exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the Czech FA verified the actual value of the delivery.
The German reply to this request sent three invoices showing a total value of the goods delivered of EUR 31 998, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech taxpayer and the MIAS data.
According to the results of the audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors, following repeated reminders from the IFA, the Czech taxpayer submitted a retrospective VAT declaration for the July 2004 tax period in January 2007.
With this declaration, the taxpayer simultaneously asserted his right to deduct VAT. Therefore, his tax liability for the tax period in question remained unchanged.
The audit confirmed that most of the tax procedures relating to the transactions selected for the audit had been completed and that appropriate measures had been taken by the tax administrations in the Czech Republic and Germany (including ex-post fixing of VAT or prevention of VAT refunds).
4.3 Examination of selected cases of risky intra-Community transactions
4.3.1 Findings in the Czech Republic
EUROCANET can be an important source of information to identify high-risk taxpayers in the Member State of acquisition.
In the Czech Republic, the early warning information obtained from EUROCANET is checked with the purchasers by the competent FA.
Since the first quarter of 2008, CZ has included information on transactions and taxable suppliers deemed to be at risk in the EUROCANET system.
Nine Czech taxpayers have been selected for the audit,
which had been entered into EUROCANET by the financial administrations of other Member States, either as suppliers or buyers.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFT blank
Since the German tax administration did not participate in the data exchange via EUROCANET, it was not possible to determine whether suppliers with a German VAT identification number were classified as high-risk by the German tax administration.
The audit identified both normal business transactions and those suspected of carousel fraud or other VAT fraud.
In these cases, the FÄ exchanged information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003,
for example:
• When examining the early warning information, the FÄ did not find any suspicion of high-risk transactions.
The taxpayers in question were constantly monitored because their data was stored in EUROCANET.
• During the audits of risky transactions, the FÄ failed to prove, on the basis of the accounting documents submitted, breaches of the rules on the calculation of the tax base and VAT, even though they found inconsistencies in the transport and storage of the goods or revealed business relationships with letter box companies from other Member States.
• The review of individual business transactions was complicated because certain taxpayers did not cooperate with the FÄ and could not be contacted.
The competent FÄ reviewed most of the high-risk taxpayers and transactions identified in EUROCANET's early warning notifications.
However, their ability to review high-risk transactions, especially so-called "missing traders," is limited.
In particular, a mere examination of the documents can hardly provide evidence of fraud on the part of the taxpayer.
Stricter requirements for the registration of taxable persons for VAT purposes and greater flexibility in the cancellation of registrations would be helpful in the fight against VAT fraud.
Taxpayers involved in fraudulent carousel transactions can be registered for VAT purposes in order to simulate fictitious deliveries of goods throughout the EU or to provide other taxpayers with formally correct tax documents with which they can then assert unjustified claims for deduction of VAT.
In the case of suspected carousel fraud in connection with imports and exports, it is recommended that customs and tax authorities work more closely together to track the identity of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final customer.
Member States may participate in EUROCANET on a voluntary basis.
The fact that three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate was considered by the European Parliament at the end of 200811 as a weakness of the system, which should be remedied by setting up a EUROFISC network with mandatory participation.
4.3.2 Findings in Germany
The Federal Audit Office evaluated data available at the Federal Central Tax Office, including data from EUROCANET.
They served as the basis for the selection of six German taxpayers whose files were reviewed.
Both Germany and a number of other countries refused to participate actively in EUROCANET.
That is why Germany has a passive status, which means that it does not send data to Brussels itself, but is only the recipient of EUROCANET data.
This is justified by the fact that "from the point of view of the Federal Government
no unambiguous legal basis [exists] that would make it possible to break the existing tax secrecy in Germany.
In addition, the Federal Government does not have reliable information on how information sent by the Member States is processed within the framework of EUROCANET. "12 Since October 2007, the Federal Central Tax Office has been evaluating the EUROCANET data and transmitting it to the federal and state tax authorities on the basis of a coordinated procedure.
The German FÄ receive control notifications on the direct business relations of the taxable persons registered with them with companies from other EU countries covered by EUROCANET.
However, the relevant German FA does not receive any information as to whether the company from the aforementioned other EU Member State has business relations with a company established in another Member State which is also in business relations with the German company mentioned in the control notice.
4.3.3 Evaluation
The CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has only a passive status.
From the point of view of an active participant, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to participate actively.
Accordingly, the audit had to be carried out differently in this area.
However, significant differences in the success of detecting VAT fraud could not be identified. The reason for this is that EUROCANET is only one component of the risk management system.
However, the financial administrations of both countries have a wide range of other tools at their disposal to detect fraudulent transactions. Nevertheless, it is necessary to develop a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.
The Council of the European Union agreed on a draft Regulation13 establishing EUROFISC, a network for the fight against VAT fraud.
The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should be shared by the Member States at European level and fed into this network.

The cases brought to court at national and European level show that there is a need for a discussion between the Member States and the Commission on the conditions for exempting intra-Community transactions.
4.4 Mutual assistance in the recovery of claims
4.4.1 Intergovernmental mutual assistance in the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic
Legislation on intergovernmental mutual assistance for the recovery of certain claims in the EU is essentially based on:
Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as levies and duties;
Council Directive 2001 / 44 / EC amending Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as levies and customs duties and with regard to VAT and certain excise duties, and
Commission Directive 2002 / 94 / EC laying down detailed rules for the implementation of certain articles of Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, customs duties, taxes and other measures.
The Czech Republic implemented Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC by Law 252 / 2000 on intergovernmental mutual assistance for the recovery of certain claims.
Following the adoption of Council Directive 2001 / 44 / EC, this too had to be transposed into Czech law. At the same time, it was necessary to amend the aforementioned law.
In this context, legislative amendment No 191 / 2004 on intergovernmental mutual assistance for the recovery of certain claims was adopted.
A new relevant piece of legislation was adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1179 / 2008 of 28 November 2008.
The annexes to this regulation contain new application forms to be used from 1 January 2009. Furthermore, the regulation makes electronic transmission mandatory and requires the requesting authority to certify the conformity of all documents sent with the respective original.
The main principles of international mutual assistance for the recovery of claims are:
1. The principle of reciprocity applies;
2. Mutual assistance shall always be provided only upon request and upon fulfilment of all conditions;
3. Mutual assistance shall not extend to claims which are considered a criminal sanction in the requested State;
4. The procedure for intergovernmental mutual assistance for the recovery of claims must be carried out in accordance with the national law of the requested State;
5. In the recovery procedure, foreign claims do not take precedence over domestic claims;
6. Mutual assistance shall be provided only for the recovery of undisputed claims;
7. The principle of utilisation shall apply: the requesting State shall use all means to which it is entitled under national law to recover the claim.
Law No 191 / 2004 provides for three forms of mutual assistance: provision of information, notification of legal acts and actual recovery.
Procedure for outgoing requests to other EU member states
The competent IFA shall forward the request for information, the request for notification of legal acts or the request for recovery, together with the relevant documents, electronically to the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic via the respective Financial Directorate.
The Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic will translate the request into the relevant language, scan it with all the attachments and send it via the communication network or the CCN / CSI common interface to the competent tax authority of the state concerned.
A request for recovery assistance must meet the following condition: the claim must exceed EUR 1 500 and must not be more than five years old.
The requested authority may refuse recovery if the requirements are not met.
Procedures for incoming requests from other Member States
The Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic must confirm receipt of requests from other Member States as soon as possible, at the latest within seven days.
If it decides not to grant the request, it must inform the requesting authority of the reasons for the refusal, specifying the specific provisions of the directive on which it is based.
The corresponding communication shall be sent no later than three months after the date of receipt of the confirmation of receipt of the request.
Upon receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance will verify that the request meets all legal requirements.
If the recovery request is granted, the IFA must, among other things, determine the debtor's financial situation, e.g. by means of extracts from the land register, enquiries about existing bank accounts and registration of motor vehicles with the registration office.
After six months from the date of receipt of the confirmation of receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic shall inform the requesting authority of the outcome of the investigations carried out.
The requesting authority must also be informed if the taxable persons concerned cannot be reached and the claim cannot therefore be recovered.
All sums successfully recovered must be transferred to the requesting authority within one month of recovery.
The Czech FA dealing with the recovery may, with the consent of the requesting state, agree on the claim or payment in instalments.
The interest or default surcharges imposed on the debtor for the period of default in accordance with Law no. 337 / 1992 on the administration of taxes and fees
are the responsibility of the requesting State.
In particular, in 2006 and 2007, the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic delayed sending the recovery requests received to the competent FA.
The same applied to the forwarding of the recovery requests made by the Czech FÄ to the competent authority in the requested State.
The audit found that the Ministry of Finance had breached the law on intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of claims by failing to inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the state of play of the recovery procedure within six months of confirmation of receipt of the request.
The situation has improved since 2008.
Statistical data
Pursuant to § 13 (4) of Law 191 / 2004, the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic prepares statistics for the European Commission until 15 March of each year. This includes the number of requests for information, notification of legal acts and recovery, including the amount of the respective claims, submitted in the previous year and received.
On the basis of the data provided by the Member States, the European Commission is preparing its report to the Council and the European Parliament on the application of the provisions on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims.
The audit showed that in 2008 the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic understated the claims by EUR 5 250 000 due to incorrect information on the amount of a VAT claim submitted in 2008 (caused by the postponement of a decimal point in the conversion of the claim from Czech crowns to euros).
The error was subsequently reflected in the statistics of the European Commission.
Information on mutual recovery assistance is set out in the table below.
4.4.2 Intergovernmental mutual assistance in the recovery of claims in Germany
The legal basis for mutual assistance in tax matters is the Community standards Council Directive 2008 / 55 / EC of 26 May 2008 (EC Recovery Directive) 14 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1178 / 2008 of 28 November 2008 (EC Implementing Directive).
In order to improve legibility and clarity, the EC Recovery Directive codified Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC of 15 March 197616, the provisions of which had been substantially amended on several occasions.
It covers, among other things, the recovery of VAT and taxes on income and assets, including the associated interest, fees and default surcharges.
The EC Recovery Directive was transposed into German law by the Recovery Act (EC) 17 of 3 May 2003.
The enforcement procedure in Germany is governed by the German Tax Code (AO).
§ 117 (2) AO stipulates that the financial authorities may provide intergovernmental legal and administrative assistance by virtue of international treaties and applicable legal norms of the European Communities in national law, as well as by virtue of the EC Mutual Assistance Act.
Part Six of the AO (§ § 249-346) contains the legal provisions for the enforcement procedure.
The administrative actions of the financial authorities are governed in particular by the enforcement and enforcement order.
The Federal Ministry of Finance agreed with the representatives of the supreme tax authorities of the Länder on the principles of mutual assistance in tax matters and transferred its own competence in this area to the Federal Central Office for Taxation18.
General conditions for the admissibility of a request for recovery assistance are:
• The legal requirements must be fulfilled (§ § 251, 254 AO).
• All domestically available recovery funds have been exhausted.
• The claims for the recovery of which mutual assistance is requested are incontestable.
• The period between the issuance of the enforcement order or the date on which the claim or title became incontestable and the date of the request shall not exceed five years.
• The claim must be at least 1,500 euros.
Procedure for outgoing requests to other EU member states The German requests for recovery of arrears are forwarded by the enforcement bodies of the FÄ via the competent funds authority and the Federal Central Tax Office to the foreign authority concerned, e.g. the Czech CLO.
The details are set out in the Factsheet on Intergovernmental Mutual Assistance in Tax Collection (recovery) of 19 January 200419.
This fact sheet is currently being revised by a federal-state working group and adapted to the new recovery directive.
The request, along with attachments, will be forwarded electronically by the FA to the central authority.
The latter checks whether it is correct in terms of content and form.
If not, the request will be returned to the FA in question.
Otherwise, it will be forwarded to the Federal Central Tax Office.
The Federal Central Tax Office will then take over the necessary communication with the foreign authority concerned.
Procedure for incoming requests from other EU member states
Requests for recovery from other Member States are recorded in the Federal Central Tax Office, which sends a confirmation of receipt within ten days.
It also checks whether the formal requirements have been met.
As a matter of principle, the Federal Central Tax Office forwards these requests to the central authority, which forwards them to the relevant IAs and supervises their execution.
The Federal Central Tax Office also sends interim and final reports.
If the processing of a request takes longer than six months, it reminds the appropriations authority of the obligation to submit an interim report under Article 16 of Commission Directive 2002 / 94 / EC.
After examining the formal and substantive conditions for the admissibility of the request, the enforcement bodies will announce relevant measures.
All amounts recovered must be transferred to the bank account specified in the request within one month of receipt.
Statistical data
Information on mutual recovery assistance between Germany and the Czech Republic for the years 2006 to 2008 (as at 31 December 2008).
4.4.3 Examination of selected recovery cases
A total of 21 inter-governmental recovery requests between the Czech Republic and Germany have been selected for examination. Ten cases are listed below, including:
It found that:
1.
On 20 October 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for VAT debts owed by a Czech taxpayer in 2004 and 2005 for a total amount of EUR 3 883 (CZK 109 820).
It was only on 26 February 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the competent FA.
In order to secure the claim to be recovered, the Czech FA charged a property belonging to the taxpayer with a real estate lien.
Since the burdened property was not sufficient to pay the entire tax liability, an installment payment agreement of at least CZK 2 000 per month was concluded with the debtor.
On 31 August 2009, an interim report was sent to the German FA. Accordingly, the taxpayer had in the meantime settled tax debts in the amount of CZK 49 600 (as at 25 August 2009).
The amount was transferred to Germany. Shortly afterwards, on 28 August 2009, a further CZK 3 000 was transferred.
2.
On 7 January 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for the recovery of tax debts (VAT, income tax) as well as interest and fees from a Czech taxpayer totalling EUR 180 869 (= CZK 4 434 915).
It was not until 27 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the competent FA.
After checking bank balances, securities, real estate, motor vehicles and other movable assets, the FA found that the debtor did not have attachable assets.
Local investigations also revealed that the debtor had been absent from his permanent residence for almost a year.
His whereabouts in the Czech Republic were unknown.
This communication was received by the Czech Ministry of Finance on 6 April 2009 and forwarded to the German tax administration on 16 April 2009.
3.
On 21 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German request for recovery of VAT together with interest and fees totalling EUR 3 139 (= CZK 84 846).
It was not until 6 August 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the competent FA. On 18 February 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance from Germany was informed that the Czech tax debtor had now settled the debt.
On 9 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance informed the Czech FA that the case was closed because the Czech tax debtor had paid his debt in full in Germany.
However, the debt was also settled in the Czech Republic as part of the recovery procedure and the corresponding amount was transferred to Germany on 27 October 2008.
Due to the long time it took the Czech Ministry of Finance to forward the information to the FA, the tax liability was paid twice - by the taxpayer himself in Germany and by means of recovery by the competent Czech FA.
In cooperation with the Federal Audit Office, it was established that the amount recovered will be offset against the tax liability from another procedure, which amounts to EUR 6 649 and should be transferred to the CZ in September 2008.
In the documents of the Czech Ministry of Finance, there was only one recovery request in the amount of EUR 3 139 for the company concerned, and the recovery request in the amount of EUR 6 649 could not be found there.
4.
On 15 September 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German request for recovery of income tax, VAT, interest and fees totalling EUR 39 957 = CZK 956 654.
It was not until 19 December 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the competent FA.
On 1 June 2009, the recovery procedure was launched and a decision was taken to seize the Czech bank balance and the debtor's salary (CZK 7 000).
During the negotiations with the FA, the debtor did not agree with the amount of the tax liability and disputed the amount.
According to the Czech FA, the debtor had been willing to pay 250 euros a month in the past, but the relevant German FA did not agree.
The taxpayer undertook to discuss his matter with the German FA in order to agree on a different amount.
The recovery procedure had not yet been completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.
5.
On 19 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German request for recovery of income tax for the year 2005 and VAT for the years 2003 to 2007, together with interest and fees totalling EUR 113 444 = CZK 3 116 304.
It was not until 14 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to FA Prague 1, which is authorised to deal with tax cases of taxpayers not resident in the Czech Republic; on the basis of the available address, it was not possible to identify a locally competent FA.
During its investigation, the FA received information and documents on 19 September 2008 indicating that the debtor's income amounted to EUR 4 704. However, it was unable to issue an enforcement order because the recovery request had been received after that date.
On 26 January 2009, the Czech FA initiated the recovery procedure and issued an enforcement order to seize the debtor's assets from credit institutions.
The recovery procedure had not yet been completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.
6.
On 3 October 2006, the competent Czech FA requested inter-governmental assistance in the recovery of a VAT debt, together with legal costs totalling CZK 146 223 742.
It was not until 13 May 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German tax administration.
On 8 September 2008, the competent German FA, via the Bundesbank, transferred to the Czech authorities the amount of EUR 17 700 recovered by attachment of accounts = CZK 439 226.
A conversion error was discovered during the review of the amounts recovered.
The amount to be recovered of CZK 146 223 742 was converted at the exchange rate of EUR 1 = CZK 25.065, but a decimal error resulted in an amount of EUR 583 378.
The correct amount of the amount to be recovered was EUR 5 833 782.
As a result, a request for recovery was made which was EUR 5 250 404 too low.
7.
On 1 March 2007, the competent Czech FA requested recovery of a VAT debt together with interest and fees from a Czech taxpayer for a total amount of CZK 1 970 632 = EUR 79 847.
It was only on 10 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German tax administration.
The German FA ordered the debtor to pay the arrears on 4 February 2009.
Taking into account the significant reduction in the Company's revenues in the second half of 2008 and in particular in the first half of 2009, as well as the corresponding liquidity situation, the following payments were made to settle the overdue tax liability: on 8 April 2009 - EUR 4 600, on 6 May 2009 - EUR 3 000 and on 16 June 2009 - EUR 2 500.
These payments were transferred to the account of the competent FA in the Czech Republic.
On 23 June 2009, a further payment of EUR 2 500 was agreed between the debtor and the FA until 30 June 2009.
8.
On 22 May 2008, the competent Czech FA requested the recovery of tax debts totalling EUR 398 653 = CZK 9 832 779, which included, inter alia, real estate transfer tax.
It was not until 2 October 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German tax administration.
In a letter from the German tax administration to the Czech Ministry of Finance dated 3 April 2009, the request was returned.
The German tax administration argued that the real estate transfer tax was not a tax within the meaning of Articles 2 (e), (f), (g) and (h) of Directive 2008 / 55 / EC.
In addition, Article 2 (g) relates to liabilities arising from taxes on income and assets.
Accordingly, Article 3 of Directive 2008 / 55 / EC applies to taxes on income and property not mentioned in Articles 1, 3 and 4 of Directive 77 / 799 / EEC.
The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed to send a new recovery request to the German tax administration, which should no longer include the real estate transfer tax arrears of CZK 61 759, but instead the arrears in VAT, corporate income tax and income tax.
The Czech Ministry of Finance has received a new request from the competent FA for the recovery of tax debts of the same taxpayer in the amount of CZK 7 079 735.

On 6 February 2006, the competent Czech FA forwarded to the Czech Ministry of Finance a request for recovery of income tax and VAT totalling CZK 3 445 782 = EUR 123 328.
The VAT debt amounted to CZK 1 133 967.
It was not until 18 April 2007 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German tax administration
and it was not until 11 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance sent the Czech FA the reply of the German tax administration dated 9 July 2007,
according to which, on 11 June 2007, the German FA issued an enforcement order for the attachment of the bank account, stating that it was not in a business relationship with the said taxpayer.
This meant that the request for the German tax administration was deemed to have been completed.
10.
On 26 September 2005, the competent Czech FA sent a request to the Czech Ministry of Finance for the recovery of VAT debts totalling CZK 1 296 845 = EUR 43 591.
The relevant Finance Directorate sent the request to the Ministry of Finance on 10 October 2005.
The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request to the German tax administration on 15 December 2005.
Prior to the submission of the request, the Czech FA enforced the tax claim by attaching bank accounts and collecting salaries, as well as by debiting a piece of land.
Prior to the recovery request, a request for information was sent to the German tax administration on 16 March 2005.
According to the reply sent to the Czech FA on 16 September 2005, the Czech taxpayer was domiciled in Germany and had income from non-self-employed activities amounting to EUR 8 437. On 20 April 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a reply to the recovery request and forwarded it to the relevant Czech FA only on 12 February 2008.
According to this, the tax liability in Germany is unrecoverable due to the debtor's inability to pay.
No assets had been found and the income from non-self-employment was already the subject of other enforcement measures.
The German tax administration therefore considered the request to be closed.
4.4.4 Comparison and Evaluation
When it comes to recovery, all EU Member States are subject to the requirements of EU law for mutual assistance.
The procedures for processing requests are therefore similar in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The Federal Court of Auditors and NKÚ have compared the statistics submitted by the two Member States to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.
There were discrepancies.
In its 200620 report, the European Commission recommended that Member States prepare their statistics with greater care.
In 200921, the Commission concluded that, despite an increase in the number of requests for mutual assistance, the inconsistencies in the statistics had decreased.
Both Court of Auditors consider it useful to have a renewed discussion at EU level on the statistics in order to avoid the remaining discrepancies in the future.
If this does not happen, the statistics are of limited significance and cannot be used for comparisons.
In addition, the Court of Auditors considers that the statistics should show both the annual number of requests and the nature of claims (e.g. VAT, income tax) and the amount of amounts recovered per Member State.
Through a more detailed analysis of the statistics provided by the Member States, the Commission could help Member States to assess their measures to combat VAT fraud.
Since the recovery rate can be calculated per Member State, the Court of Auditors recommends that Member States with a low rate should aim for at least the average recovery rate within the EU.
At the request of a Member State, the Commission could play an active role in this.
Foreign recovery requests received by the Ministry of Finance CZ were delayed in particular in 2006 and 2007 when they were forwarded to the relevant FÄ.
The same applies to the recovery requests made by the Czech FÄ.
The audit found that the Czech Ministry of Finance infringed Law No 191 / 2004 on intergovernmental recovery assistance in so far as it did not inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the progress of the recovery measures within the six-month period from receipt of the request.
4.5 Value-added tax audit at large companies
4.5.1 Value added tax audit for large enterprises in the Czech Republic
Background
The taxation procedure for large companies is subject to the same rules that apply to other taxable persons.
The audit of large enterprises is regulated by the Czech Law no. 337 / 1992, the "Tax and Fee Administration Act."
The Czech Ministry of Finance defines large enterprises as natural persons who have established a business or legal entities established for the purpose of carrying out a business and whose net turnover for the tax period in question is at least CZK 2 billion according to the income or corporate tax return.
The taxable person is classified as a large enterprise on the basis of the amount of turnover according to the income or corporate tax return in the respective tax period; for the first time for the year 2003.
A natural or legal person is no longer listed as a large business for VAT purposes if, for three consecutive taxation periods, its net turnover during the taxation period is less than CZK 2 billion. The period begins at the end of the taxation period for which the conditions were met for the first time according to the tax return.
A taxable person can only be removed from the list of large companies if at least one type of tax has been examined in advance for a tax period.
By the end of 2009, all large farms had been audited at least every five years.
Since 2010, taxpayers have to be assessed in writing at least every two years. Subsequent control measures are intended to eliminate the tax risks and their negative impact on the proper assessment and collection of taxes.
Audits by the FÄ should focus on at least one type of tax; they usually cover several tax periods.
Large taxable enterprises have been audited by the special audit bodies or audit services of the competent FÄ set up at a total of 13 FÄ.
A special audit body carried out audits in its local area of responsibility in accordance with the requirements of the Head of the Financial Directorate.
It also examined:
taxable persons with unusual and special business activities, and
those whose examination required a high degree of expertise and time.
Tax payers with complex location distribution and organisational structure will also be audited,
Taxpayers suspected of large-scale tax evasion
as well as taxpayers belonging to chains and networks suspected of large-scale tax evasion and unjustified deduction.
Information on the number of audits carried out by the FÄ special audit bodies and the additional tax results of these audits are presented in Table No. 3.
The Czech Ministry of Finance has submitted a proposal to amend Act No. 531 / 1990 for the regional tax authorities. In particular, it proposes the establishment of a special tax office with national jurisdiction for selected taxpayers (legal entities established for the purpose of economic activity with a turnover of at least CZK 2 billion).
4.5.2 Value added tax audit for large companies in Germany
Background
The VAT audit of large companies is not particularly regulated in Germany. General regulations • of the Tax Code (AO), • of the Financial Administration Act (FVG) and • of the Tax Audit Regulations (BpO) apply to tax audits.
There are also working aids.
Tax code
The provisions of § § 193 to 203 AO "Section 4 - External Audit" contain in particular rules for the admissibility of an external audit and its factual scope, distribution of responsibilities, form and content of the audit announcement, audit principles, obligations of the taxpayer to cooperate and requirements for final interviews as well as for the transmission of the audit report.
External inspections are carried out by the competent FÄ (§ 195 AO).
Pursuant to § 5 (1) no. 1 in conjunction with § 19, it is the responsibility of the Federal Central Tax Office to participate in external audits of the FÄ.
The nature and extent of this cooperation will be agreed between the authorities involved.
In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office may require that certain establishments designated by it be audited at a certain point in time.
In this case, it may lay down arrangements for the external audit of these taxpayers.
According to article 108 paragraph 7 of the Basic Law, the tax audit regulations (BpO 2000) were issued with the consent of the Bundesrat.
It applies to external audits carried out by the state tax authorities and the Federal Central Tax Office.
In accordance with § 3 BpO, companies are regularly classified into size classes.
Large enterprises are to be subjected to a follow-up test (point 4.2 BpO).
In accordance with Section 33.1 BpO, each competent tax authority must maintain a group directory within the meaning of the regulation.
Work tools for the administration
In addition, the following tools have been issued for the administration:
• "Uniform manual for the VAT special audit";
• VAT-Countries-Online - USLO (= dialogue system in the intra-Community VAT control procedure) with instructions on how to use the data contained in the MIAS on intra-Community business relations;
• Working aids for difficult and special situations.
• Central database for the storage and evaluation of VAT fraud cases and the development of risk profiles - ZAUBER;
Taxpayers are grouped into size categories based on criteria such as turnover and profit, with limits varying depending on the branch of business.
The figures are published by the German Federal Ministry of Finance.
The values are reviewed every three years and fixed for the following three years.
The number of enterprises - not only large enterprises - is to be determined regularly (last cut-off date: 1 January 2010).
In general, large companies need to be fully audited.
The tests are announced and usually also extend to the VAT,
that is to say, the audit covers all relevant taxes, namely income tax, corporation tax, business tax and VAT.
The value added tax can be audited either by tax auditors or VAT special auditors.
The practice varies and depends on the administrative structure of each country.
The number of tax periods covered by an audit usually varies between three and five years.
The BpO 2000 is based on three years.
All taxes to which a company has been subject are subject to the audit.
4.5.3 Management of the value added tax audit at large companies
As agreed, the two courts of auditors did not examine individual cases. They looked into the question of how the financial administrations proceed in the VAT audit of large companies.
They used a questionnaire to collect information from the financial administrations, which is essential for auditing large companies.
• Which statistical records and evaluations for VAT audit of large companies are available to the management of the tax administration?
In particular:
• Are there statistics or records on the extent to which a distinction is made between the fight against VAT fraud and the general VAT audit?
CZ: No, the current version of the ATIS system does not allow such a distinction.
Germany: The tax administration does not distinguish between audits to combat VAT fraud and general VAT audits.
• Are there any statistics or records on the timeliness of the tests?
CZ: Information on the timeliness of audits of intra-Community purchases of selected VAT payers will be recorded in the ATIS system;
The same applies to information about the start and end of the FA's investigation.
Germany: No, the statistics for auditors summarised at federal level only contain information on the so-called average last audit period (year).
This figure does not give an overview of the audit periods selected for individual companies.
Special VAT auditors focus on the most recent VAT assessment periods and are also authorised to audit large companies.
The statistics for VAT special auditors kept at the federal level do not contain information on the size class of the audited establishment.
• Are there statistics or records of the type of additional result; for example, broken down by:
i. Real additional result (e.g. application of a reduced rate instead of the general rate of VAT)
ii. false surplus income (e.g. relocation / postponement of a situation which is not objectionable under VAT law to another tax period)
iii. Cash effectiveness (payment of the fixed surplus result)
CZ:
The Czech Tax Administration monitors the number of tax audits carried out, the amount of the additional tax result broken down by tax type, the number of audited taxpayers and the number of audited tax periods.
Other tax procedures (on-the-spot investigations, payment orders) will be monitored in the same way.
Regardless of this, the amount of additional payments and incoming payments are recorded.
Statistics on tax liabilities are broken down by type of tax. However, no distinction is made between tax liabilities arising from a tax return and those arising from the audit actions of the FA.
Germany: No, the statistics for tax auditors and VAT special auditors combined at the federal level do not differentiate according to the above-mentioned criteria.
Nor did most tax authorities where local surveys were carried out differentiate in this respect.
• Are results-oriented fields of examination recorded?
CZ: Yes, the FA can select audit cases on the basis of criteria linked to selected indicators stored in the ATIS system.
Germany: There are no regulations at federal level.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for tax auditors and VAT special auditors do not provide such information.
However, the federal and state finance ministries have agreed on a common approach.
According to this, auditors and tax investigators of the Länder have to enter the additional tax result they have achieved in ZAUBER if a certain threshold is exceeded.
In this case, supplementary information must be provided, for example, on the origin of the additional VAT result achieved.
• What are the most common findings?
CZ:
- large taxable enterprises have unjustifiably claimed the deduction of input tax for supplies and services received,
• which have not been used for business activities pursuant to § 72 (1) CZ UStG;
• which were used for representation expenses according to § 75 (3) CZ UStG;
• due to invoices that do not comply with the requirements of § 73 (1) CZ UStG
- large taxable enterprises have omitted the declaration of VAT to be paid as provided for in § 21 (1) CZ VAT Act.
Germany: There are no regulations at federal level.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for tax auditors and VAT special auditors do not provide such information.
Findings on VAT from audits of large enterprises are not recorded separately by the countries.
The Federal Central Tax Office can, however, evaluate the ZAUBER database, into which tax auditors and tax investigators of the Länder are required to enter the additional tax result they achieve if a certain threshold is exceeded.
• Does the financial administration analyse promising audit areas and draw conclusions from them for strategic management?
CZ: Yes, for example, national audits are carried out for high-risk goods and sectors.
Germany: There are no regulations at federal level.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for tax auditors and VAT special auditors do not provide information on particularly "productive" audit fields.
As regards the analysis of such information, the usefulness and the way in which it is further used, there were different views among the survey bodies.
Some Chief Financial Directorates make such information available to the FÄ, but the FÄ are free to use it or not.
4.5.4 Comparison and Evaluation
As a result, large amounts of information are processed automatically in the CZ. Among other things, data from VAT audits, as well as key figures from balance sheets, profit and loss accounts are processed in the system.
The CZ is able to manage the selection of high-risk cases on the basis of a wide range of information.
The same applies to the evaluation and management of VAT audits in general.
In the Czech Republic, the establishment of a special tax office for large companies is planned for 2012.
In Germany, the tax administration does not collect comparably large amounts of data.
Accordingly, it is more difficult to carry out these tasks in the same way.
The emphasis is more on the selection of relevant individual cases.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFT blank
On the basis of the information in VAT pre-declarations or VAT declarations as well as audit notes, qualified auditors select the cases to be examined and ensure the appropriate taxation.
Appropriate management processes and risk management systems must be put in place in order to reduce revenue losses at the VAT and, at the same time, increase the risk of being discovered for unreliable entrepreneurs.

5. Conclusions
The cooperation between the two Court of Auditors has proved its worth.
In this way, it was possible to gain necessary insights into the systems applied in both countries: in particular: • Intra-Community transactions, • Risk management at the VAT in particular with regard to the selection of risky transactions, • Recovery of VAT receivables and • VAT audit of large companies.
The audit revealed differences in the strategies for detecting VAT fraud and in the systems described above.
These findings can be used to improve existing procedures.
They can also be used to initiate a discussion among interested parties as to which audit approaches and strategies can be used to combat fraud, for example with regard to relations within and between the Member States and the EU Commission.
The experience and knowledge gained should encourage a joint examination of the management of the VAT in the future.

Report on the results of the parallel audit of the VAT administration of the Czech Republic and Germany
Preface
The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, emphasises that the Courts of Auditors have the power to audit all public finances.
The declaration requires that the courts of auditors should have the power to audit tax collection as widely as possible.
The Organisation of the European Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxes to be an important part of public revenue.
The thematic focus of the VI EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the audit of public revenue by the Courts of Auditors.
One of the most important steps towards optimising the audit activities of a Court of Auditors is the development of a specific strategy for the audit of public revenue.
This is especially true for taxes as the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of default.
As the national economies are increasingly interconnected and interdependent, a situation may arise in which the national audit bodies can only carry out their audit work in cooperation with the audit bodies of other states.
An example could be the examination of internationally organised fraud, which can lead to significant loss of revenue in many states.
Cooperation between authorities is needed in the fight against such crimes.
Courts of Auditors that audit in this area must be prepared to cooperate closely with each other.
The idea for an audit of the value added tax and the MIAS system was born at the VI EUROSAI Congress in Bonn. This audit was carried out in cooperation between the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Audit Office.
In the course of thorough preparation, the participating courts of auditors first had to familiarise themselves with the legal framework and procedures of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.
On the basis of the analysis of the available information, we made the selection of the subject matter for the examination planning.
Achieving efficient and effective management of turnover tax is a long-standing problem and individual states (in particular the EC Member States) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify the collection of turnover tax and create greater transparency in this area.
We are convinced that the results of our audit can not only contribute to improving the work of financial management, but can also form the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international exchange of information.
Report on the results of the parallel audit of the VAT administration of the Czech Republic and Germany
Introduction
Case number: CZ) 06 / 27 (DE) VIII 2 - 2005 - 1215
Subject of examination:
(CZ) Administration of VAT after the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union
(DE) Examination of administrative cooperation in the field of VAT in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and 1925 / 2004
the Commission's audit objective:
(CZ) The purpose of the audit in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedures applied by the tax administration in the field of value added tax following the integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter "EC") with the free movement of goods and services, as well as the use of MIAS1, in particular the control of the use of the VAT exemption for intra-Community supplies.
(DE) The purpose of the audit was to examine the system of intra-Community VAT control, with a focus on mutual assistance in the field of value added tax in accordance with the above-mentioned regulations.
As a result of the audit, weaknesses should be identified and recommendations should be made to address them.
VAT Information Exchange System The audits were carried out jointly by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic ("NKÚ") and the Federal Court of Auditors ("BRH") of the Federal Republic of Germany under an agreement concluded on 8 June 2006.
The cooperation focused on the review of selected business transactions between entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the exploitation of information obtained through international administrative assistance between tax administrations, and the comparison of VAT management systems in the two countries.
A joint final report on the results of the audits has been prepared in accordance with European Guideline No 31 for the implementation of the INTOSAI audit standards.
The audited period covered the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005.
Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel examination
The parallel audit of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two courts of auditors.
In addition to the focus on the exchange of information provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and Commission Regulation 1925 / 2004, other closely related aspects have also been examined, such as the registration of tax payers, tax returns and summary reports.
The audit also covered the legal situation of cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach and the comparison of statistical data.
When comparing the systems of VAT administrations in the two states, differences were found in the following areas:
1) Registration for VAT purposes.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among others, the main criterion for registration is exceeding the turnover threshold laid down in the Value Added Tax Act.
In the Czech Republic, taxpayers receive only a single tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, the tax payer receives a tax number valid only for domestic transactions for the purposes of value added tax.
If the German taxpayer wishes to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must apply for the issuance of a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID number.
As problems arise from the different registration procedures, the rules should be harmonised within the EC (see 4.1).
2) International passenger transport by bus and coach.
In the Czech Republic, international passenger transport by bus and coach is exempt from VAT, but there is a right to deduct VAT.
In Germany, the transport service, as far as the route passes through Germany, is subject to VAT.
Efforts should be made at EC level to unify the situation in accordance with Article 393 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of turnover tax (see 4.2).
3) Tax returns.
Whereas in the Czech Republic tax payers have to file VAT returns only for tax periods during the year (month or quarter), in Germany tax payers have to file VAT returns (monthly or quarterly)
pre-registration of sales tax and after the end of the calendar year to file a sales tax annual return.
In contrast to the Czech Republic, tax payers in Germany have to file their VAT pre-declarations electronically.
The introduction of the electronic filing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of the Czech tax administration (see 4.3).
4) Summary messages.
While tax payers in the Czech Republic have to submit their summary declarations to the tax authorities (FÄ), German tax payers have to submit the summary declarations to the CLO2.
Accordingly, the data from the Summary Notifications will be available to FÄ in the Czech Republic as soon as they are submitted.
The data from the Summary Reports will not be available to German FÄ until they have been processed by the CLO.
In order to combat VAT fraud, updated information on intra-Community transactions is needed as soon as possible.
The monthly submission of summary reports would shorten the period between the time of the turnover and the update of the MIAS data.
This would allow for a timely assessment of taxation in the purchaser's Member State (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduce the same deadlines.
5) International exchange of information in the field of VAT.
In the case of requests for information, the Czech CLO monitors compliance with the three-month deadline.
The German CLO does not monitor the processing times.
As a result, the German tax administration has dealt with a significantly lower percentage of requests for information within the prescribed period.
Because of these problems, the BRH has recommended to the German CLO a continuous monitoring of the deadlines (see 4.6).
6) Risk management.
Each of the two Member States is in the process of developing its own risk management system (RMS) with appropriate strengths and weaknesses.
The NKÚ and the BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by one Member State alone.
Successful criteria, elements or approaches of an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EC Member States. Otherwise, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5.).
Within the framework of the cooperation, the two courts examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions carried out between Czech and German tax entities.
Of these, 31 cases were reviewed jointly through the use of the legal possibilities of the CLO where there were doubts as to the correct taxation or suspicion of VAT fraud.
The Court of Auditors found that:
In some cases, the FÄ used the information obtained in the international exchange of information and re-established the VAT liability of the tax payers concerned.
In these cases, the tax payers had either made unlawful use of the VAT exemption or had not stated the purchase of goods in their VAT return.
In some cases, the FÄ were unable to use the information obtained in the exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used due to differences in legislation in the two Member States.
In some cases, the tax administration of another Member State refused to provide the requested information.
A number of cases have been uncovered in which tax payers incorrectly reported turnover in their summary reports.
As a result, the data in the MIAS were accordingly incorrect, so that the case officers (the FÄ) had to investigate in these cases (see 6).

Cooperation between the two Courts of Auditors
In the run-up to the parallel audit, several meetings were held between representatives of both courts.
The participants in these meetings familiarized themselves with the organization of the tax administration, the legislation on value added tax and the system of value added tax administration in each country.
The subject of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006.
The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.
At this meeting a timetable for the further procedure was drawn up and the following examination topics were determined for the parallel tests: 1.
Registration of tax payers.
2.
International passenger transport by bus and coach - legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.
3. International exchange of information, in particular the handling by tax officials of requests for information and the review of selected problem cases mentioned in the requests for information, as well as spontaneous information between the Czech Republic and Germany.
4. Tax returns.
5.
Summary messages.
6.
Statistical information on deliveries and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany.
7. Risk management in the value added tax area.
At a meeting to coordinate the further examination of the NKÚ and the BRH in December 2006, both sides familiarised themselves with the examination procedure in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the already achieved results of the parallel tests.

An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic whose turnover for the last 12 consecutive calendar months exceeds the amount of CZK 1,000,000 becomes liable for payment on the first day of the third month after the month in which he has exceeded the threshold (§ 94 (1) of Act No. 235 / 2004 Coll., on VAT; hereinafter referred to as "Act No. 235 / 2004").
The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he or she has exceeded the registration threshold.
Current legislation does not allow the retroactive registration of a tax payer if he has exceeded the application deadline for registration.
An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic who provides services subject to VAT or services exempt from VAT with the right to deduct VAT must register for VAT even if his turnover does not exceed CZK 1 million, but he fulfils other requirements set out in Act No. 235 / 2004.
An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic who does not meet any of the requirements set out in the law may voluntarily apply for VAT registration.
Upon receipt of the registration application by the local tax officer, the registration procedure pursuant to Law no. 337 / 1992 begins.
If you want to register voluntarily for value added tax, you must indicate in your application the cut-off date from which you apply for registration as a VAT payer.
The tax officer has to check the information provided by the entrepreneur, i.e. the completed application for registration with all the installations.
If he has doubts about the information provided therein, he shall invite the applicant to explain, supplement or substantiate the information provided.
If the tax officer has verified that the entrepreneur meets the requirements for registration, he shall issue a written opinion on the registration and allocation of a tax number.
In the decision, the tax officer shall indicate the date of entry into force of the VAT registration and the assessment period for the VAT.
The taxation period is the calendar quarter, unless the entrepreneur's turnover for the previous calendar year has reached the amount of at least CZK 10,000,000.
If this is the case, the taxation period is the calendar month.
An entrepreneur whose turnover in the preceding calendar year has reached at least CZK 2,000,000 is entitled to choose the calendar month as the taxation period and has to inform the tax officer of this change.
The issue of a tax number in the registration notice always has a constitutive character.
The tax payer shall provide the tax identification number in all communications (including payments) with the tax officer, as well as in cases where this is required by a special law (e.g. Law No. 235 / 2004, concerning the preparation of tax documents) 3.
The tax number contains the coding "CZ" and a basic component in the form of a general identification symbol.
In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or other general identification mark, as determined by a special law. In the case of legal entities, the general identification mark is the company identification number (in accordance with the provisions of § 33 (12) of Law no. 337 / 1992).
If, despite being requested to do so by the tax officer, the entrepreneur has not fulfilled his obligation, the local tax officer shall register him ex officio.
A notice of this will also be sent to the taxpayer.
In the Czech Republic, every entrepreneur licensed to do business receives a tax number for any type of tax when he registers for the first time.
This also applies to registration as a VAT payer.
Pursuant to Law no. 235 / 2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, in the event of non-fulfilment of the VAT registration obligation, the tax officer may require the tax payer to pay up to 10% of the proceeds from the taxable turnover unlawfully made without taxation, for the period from the date on which the entrepreneur should have been registered as a tax payer until the date on which the registration as a tax payer was made by order of the tax officer (§ 98 (1) of Law no. 235 / 2004).
Payment of the amount thus determined shall be deemed to be a tax payment within the meaning of § 98 (3) of Law no. 235 / 2004, i.e. it shall not constitute a fine or penalty.
If the legal requirements are met, the registration of a person liable for VAT can be deleted for two reasons:
1) Donald Trump
Cancellation of the registration at the request of the tax payer, i.e. mainly because the turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (§ 106 (1) of Act no. 235 / 2004).
A taxpayer may request the cancellation of his registration at the earliest one year after the date of entry into force stated in the registration notice.
2) Cancellation of the registration ex officio (§ 106 (7) of Law No. 235 / 2004) if: a) the tax payer has not provided a service for 12 consecutive months and has not informed the tax officer of the reasons for this, b) the tax payer has not fulfilled his obligations under Law No. 235 / 2004, c) the previous tax payer no longer fulfils the requirements for the tax payer.
B) Tax payer without legal domicile, registered office or business premises in the Czech Republic A person who is registered for tax purposes in another Member State and does not have his legal domicile, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic, or a tax payer foreigner who provides services in the Czech Republic and is required to file a tax return and pay taxes for such services or supplies pursuant to section 108 of Act No. 235 / 2004 ("non-resident entrepreneur") becomes tax payer with the provision of the service in question.
He must submit an application for registration with FA Prague 1 at the latest on the day of the delivery in question.
He is obliged to indicate in this application all VAT identification numbers allocated to him in other Member States or third countries.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration later than on the date of the first taxable provision of services in the Czech Republic, FA Prague 1 has to register him retroactively, as he became subject to VAT on the date of the first taxable provision of services in the Czech Republic in accordance with Act No. 235 / 2004.
In the case of retroactive registration, FA Prague 1 must request from the entrepreneurs concerned a receipt (invoices or written explanations) for proof of performance.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration in the Czech Republic prior to the first performance of a service, FA Prague 1 shall require the submission of the performance-justifying contract documents.
As of 31 December 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with FA Prague 1, of which 124 were from Germany. As of 31 December 2005, a total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered, of which 233 were from Germany.
In accordance with the provisions of § 106 (9) of Law No. 235 / 2004, the tax officer is authorised to cancel the registration of a non-resident entrepreneur as of 31 January of the following calendar year if the latter does not accept the obligation to file tax declarations or returns and to pay tax.
An audit of the NKÚ revealed that in the case of filing a tax return by post with dispatch abroad on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the mandatory deadline for filing a tax return, this declaration had not yet been received by the FA by 31 January.
In cases where these facts, which are relevant for the possibility of cancellation of the registration, become known to the FA later than on 31 January, cancellation of the registration of the non-resident entrepreneur for VAT in the Czech Republic in the calendar year in question is no longer possible.
Registration of tax payers in Germany
In accordance with the provisions of the tax code (§ § 137, 138 AO), each business operation must be registered with the municipality and / or the competent tax office.
This registration must be made no later than one month after commencement of business activities.
The municipality forwards the registration to the tax authorities.
If the competent tax office determines that a business activity has been started but has not been declared, it may also register the tax payer ex officio retroactively.
In Germany, tax payers are obliged to register for VAT purposes, regardless of whether they are resident or non-resident, if they fulfil the requirements of § 2 of the German Value Added Tax Act (UStG).
This does not depend on the level of turnover achieved.
There is no voluntary registration in Germany.
Special FÄ are responsible for foreign-based entrepreneurs.
For example, FA ChemnitzSüd is responsible for those entrepreneurs who have their registered office in the Czech Republic.
As of 30 April 2004, a total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered with it; as of 1 March 2006, 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered there.
According to the findings of the BRH, these FÄ with special competences frequently refused to register so-called false self-employed persons residing in the new Central and Eastern European Member States of the EC.
Since the free movement of workers is still restricted following the accession of these ten countries to the EC, these self-employed people tried to circumvent these restrictions by setting up their own business.
These (certificate) self-employed persons do not fulfil the conditions specified in § 2 UStG for recognition as entrepreneurs, since they are usually dependent on a single client, who determines their working time and the type of work to be carried out.
In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must fill in a questionnaire from the competent FA and provide details of the company and the business activity carried out.
The questionnaire is a binding form for all FÄ in Germany.
It is processed either in special organisational units within the FÄ or in the organisational units generally responsible for tax assessment.
This form is used to carry out a risk assessment for the individual tax payer prior to the allocation of a tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions is based on certain requirements:
The first three digits are the identification number for the responsible FA, the following three (or four) digits indicate which department is responsible within the FA, the following five (or four) digits are the identifier for the tax payer, the last digit is always a control digit.
If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-Community trade, he needs a VAT ID number in order to be able to make tax-free intra-Community deliveries.
This is allocated by the CLO on application if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany for VAT purposes.
The VAT ID number is automatically allocated by the CLO if the tax payer declares intra-Community deliveries in his VAT pre-declarations or in his annual VAT return.
The VAT ID number consists of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.
The registration of an entrepreneur can be cancelled: 1. On request (e.g. if he stops doing business), but only after completion of all taxation transactions (assessment of all financial years) or 2. If the tax administration determines that he is no longer doing business.
As a rule, the validity of the VAT ID number depends on the validity of the VAT number.
In such cases, the FÄ must inform the CLO of the cancellation of the VAT number, so that the validity of the VAT ID number can be terminated there at that time.
According to the Value Added Tax Act (§ 19 (1) UStG), domestic tax payers do not have to pay value added tax in the following cases: 1. the turnover of the previous calendar year plus the resulting value added tax has not exceeded the amount of 17,500 €and 2. is unlikely to exceed the amount of 50,000 €in the following year.
The so-called small entrepreneurs are not entitled to charge VAT to other entrepreneurs, nor are they entitled to deduct VAT.
Although they do not have to pay sales tax, small business owners are required to register with the tax office and file an annual sales tax return.
A small business owner may declare the non-application of Section 19 (1) of the VAT Act.
This declaration is binding for the following five years.
He may then charge the value added tax and deduct the input tax.
Non-resident tax payers may appoint a fiscal representative (§ 22a UStG).
The prerequisite for this is that they only carry out tax-free transactions and do not deduct VAT.
The fiscal representative fulfils the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur, so that he does not have to register for VAT purposes.
The invoices must state that a fiscal representative has been appointed.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation in the two states is different.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first requirement for registration (among others) is to exceed the threshold set out in the VAT Act.
If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he can register voluntarily.
The registration procedure in Germany is standardized, but differences may occur due to different organizational structures in the individual federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the tax payer receives a tax number at the time of his or her first registration for any tax.
In the case of its registration for VAT, this tax number also applies to intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, an entrepreneur who registers for VAT purposes receives a tax number exclusively for intra-German transactions.
If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must specifically apply for the allocation of a VAT ID number.
Both NKÚ and BRH found that the German two-tier registration system can lead to significant misunderstandings in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which issue a single identification number for both national VAT registration and intra-Community transactions.
On the other hand, the two-stage system allows for retrospective (national registration) in cases where the tax payer does not register his business with the municipality or the competent FA.
This retroactive registration allows an accurate assessment of the value added tax for previous tax periods, in particular an accurate estimate of the value added tax liability.
As the different registration procedures give rise to problems, the rules should be harmonised across the EC.
The German Parliament has recently decided to introduce a tax identification number.
This is to be allocated by the Federal Central Tax Office to every natural person after birth.
This number is valid for natural persons resident in Germany for life.
If a natural person starts a business activity, the competent FA applies for a commercial tax identification number, which serves as a VAT ID number.
In the future, therefore, there should be no delay between the national registration of a tax payer and the allocation of the VAT number.
Work on the implementation of an IT procedure for the management of numbers is ongoing.
International passenger transport by bus and coach
The legal regulations in the Czech Republic
According to the provisions of § 70 of Law No. 235 / 2004, since 1 May 2004, the carriage of passengers between individual Member States and between Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic is exempt from VAT and is entitled to deduct VAT.
The exemption from VAT also applies if the transport is carried out by persons registered as tax payers in other Member States or by foreigners subject to tax in their own country.
The return journey is considered to be a separate transport procedure.
If non-resident entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic do not carry out any economic activity other than the international transport of passengers by bus and coach, they are not obliged to register as subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.
International passenger transport in the Czech Republic has been exempted from VAT in accordance with the Act on Accession of the Czech Republic, Annex V, Chapter 5 (1) (b), which states in the text:
"For the purpose of applying Article 28 (3) (b) of Directive 77 / 388 / EEC, the Czech Republic may, in accordance with point 17 in Annex F of the Directive, maintain the tax exemption for international passenger transport either until the condition of Article 28 (4) of the Directive is fulfilled or as long as the same tax exemption is applied by any of the current Member States."
The legal regulations in Germany
In accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006, as implemented in Germany by § 3b (1) UStG, a transport service is carried out where the transport is effected.
Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and cross-border passenger transport.
Only the domestic part of the transport service is subject to tax in Germany.
German taxation also does not distinguish between resident and non-resident (bus) entrepreneurs.
If a non-resident taxable person transports persons through Germany, the part of the transport attributable to Germany shall be deemed to be taxable transport.
Before providing its services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must notify the competent FA of his intention to provide passenger transport services.
This registers it for tax purposes (compare 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for each bus and coach named in the tax payer's registration.
The entrepreneur must state his tax-liable transport services in a German VAT return.
As of 1 March 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered with the Chemnitz-Süd FA.
If the transport service is provided for an entrepreneur resident in the country, the non-resident tax payer does not have to pay the VAT himself to the FA.
In its place, the domestic purchaser of the services has to pay VAT to the tax office and the net amount invoiced to the non-resident tax payer, which is referred to as "transfer of liability" and is in accordance with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC.
In addition to the registration by a non-resident tax payer and his / her income tax return, the German tax administration has several means at its disposal to verify the accuracy of the tax return with regard to tax-liable passenger transport:
Mobile customs control groups check the certificates of buses and coaches registered abroad, which are used for the transport of passengers through Germany.
After each inspection, the mobile control groups submit an inspection protocol to the relevant FA.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group may require the bus driver to pay VAT before continuing his journey.
The non-resident tax payer may deduct the value added tax paid in this way from the tax liability stated in his VAT return.
If the IO has doubts as to the accuracy of a VAT return, it may order an audit to be carried out in the IO, or it may use the means of mutual assistance referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 (see point 4.6).
Even if the foreign taxpayer refuses to pay the legally established value-added tax, the IFA may request mutual assistance in accordance with Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC.
The BRH considers these means of administrative assistance in tax matters for checking the value added tax return or compliance with the tax obligation by a non-resident bus operator to be too burdensome in relation to the low income from value added tax on passenger transport subject to tax.
In particular, auditing the books of a non-resident tax payer incurs disproportionate costs for the tax payer himself and for the tax administration.
The latter must check the foreign books, which requires knowledge not only of the foreign language, but also of the foreign accounting principles.
Accordingly, such an audit is likely to require more time than that of a resident tax payer, although the audit is limited to passenger transport taking place in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident taxpayer must accept not only the audit rights of his national tax administration, but also those of the other Member States in so far as he carries out passenger transport there.
In addition, for each Member State in which even a single passenger transport is carried out, the tax payer must comply with all existing tax obligations in the various languages and on the basis of the forms of the financial administrations of the EC Member States concerned.
Thus, the correct taxation of cross-border passenger transport services leads to a disproportionate administrative burden.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation is different in the two states.
In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between different EC Member States and between Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT by virtue of the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic to the EC.
In Germany, the transport service is subject to VAT in accordance with the route allocated to German territory.
If a non-resident tax payer provides such a transport service for the first time, he or she must notify the competent FA in advance.
This registers the taxable person, who has to declare the taxable portion of the transport service in a tax return in Germany.
Law enforcement in Germany is very time-consuming.
At least three out of four Czech tax payers registered with the Chemnitz-Süd FA have passenger transport as a business purpose.
The tax revenue in question is quite low in relation to the administrative burden.
Member States - which levy turnover tax in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of turnover tax - have a high administrative burden in relation to the relevant tax revenue.
In order to avoid the disproportionate costs of the VAT assessment, cross-border passenger transport should only be subject to tax in one Member State.
This could be the State in which the transport begins or in which the service provider is established.
This type of taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006.
Sales tax returns
Filing and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic
Unless otherwise provided by law, even if no tax liability has arisen, the entrepreneur is obliged to file a VAT return on the form provided by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the expiry of the tax period.
The tax liability arises upon expiry of the deadline for filing the VAT return. According to Act no. 235 / 2004, VAT on the import of goods is excluded from this regulation. Here, the due date of the tax is determined in accordance with customs regulations.
If a claim for a refund arises as a result of higher-than-average deductible input taxes, this amount will be refunded to the taxpayer within 30 days of the date on which this deduction was established, without the need to file an application.
The deadline is not applied in cases where the tax officer initiates a tax procedure with regard to the tax liability of the tax payer.
Pursuant to § 73 (11) of Act No. 235 / 2004, the right to deduct input tax may be asserted at the latest with the regular tax return for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the right to deduct input tax was established.
After expiry of this period, the deduction can still be claimed within three years of the end of the tax period during which the claim would have been possible for the first time.
This requires, however, the submission of a supplementary VAT return.
An amendment to Act No. 235 / 2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, allows the filing of a supplementary VAT return only for the period during which the right to deduct VAT could have been claimed for the first time.
A tax payer must file a supplementary VAT return if: a) the sum of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax liability, b) he makes corrections that do not change the last known tax liability, but only change previous information, c) he makes corrections to the VAT rate and the tax liability in accordance with § 49 of Act no. 235 / 2004.
A tax payer may file a supplementary VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax liability.
The taxpayer must file the supplementary tax return by the end of the month following the month in which the facts in question have been established.
The VAT declaration can be submitted electronically either via the Internet or by means of data media.
The delivery via Internet can be carried out with a certified electronic signature or without it.
If it is carried out without an electronic signature, it must also be submitted on data carriers.
The form for the VAT return contains separate lines for indicating the value of intra-Community supplies and purchases.
The value of related services must be stated in separate lines of the VAT return.
Some headings will be used for automated primary controls under the ATIS system.
The value of goods delivered to other EC Member States to persons registered there as subject to tax will be compared with the data provided by Czech taxpayers in their summary declarations.
The value of purchases of goods from other Member States by persons registered there as subject to tax is compared with the information in the summary declarations of tax payers from other EC Member States with the help of MIAS.
Within the framework of the ATIS system, a credibility check of VAT returns is carried out by the FA.
This is done automatically, as the VAT return cannot be processed without the prior check.
The credibility check includes a calculation of the standards for credibility and an assessment of the risks of VAT returns.
Pursuant to the provisions of § 37 (1) of Law No. 337 / 1992, the FA may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who fail to comply with their non-monetary obligations under this or a special tax law or a decision under this law.
Automated tax information system - Automated tax information system used by Czech tax offices to provide technical support for tax collection.
During its audit, the NKÚ found that the FÄ rarely made use of the possibility of imposing a fine on the tax payer in the event of failure to file a VAT return.
Filing and processing of VAT returns in Germany
In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly VAT pre-declarations and the annual VAT return.
Those tax payers, who are obliged to file advance VAT declarations, must still file an annual VAT return.
Even small business owners, who are not obliged to pay VAT, have to file an annual VAT return.
Tax payers are generally obliged to file a VAT pre-declaration by the 10th day after the end of the calendar quarter in which the value added tax is incurred (§ 18 (2) UStG).
However, if the value added tax liability amounted to more than €6,136 in the previous year or if it is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur is obliged to file monthly advance VAT declarations no later than the 10th day after the end of the month in question.
The tax payer may also decide to file monthly VAT pre-declarations if he has received a refund of €6,136 in the previous year (§ 18 (2a) UStG).
If the annual value added tax does not amount to more than 512 €, neither VAT declarations nor VAT returns are to be submitted.
A resulting VAT liability has to be paid 10 days after the end of the tax period.
A refund can lead to a more thorough audit by the tax administration.
(Statutory) deadlines for the processing of VAT returns and for the refund of VAT overpayments do not exist.
In order to receive a prompt refund, a security can be offered for the refund amount.
As a matter of principle, VAT returns, including refund cases, must be processed quickly.
The German Value Added Tax Act allows for an extension of these (surrender or payment) periods (§ 18 (6) UStG).
The extension of the time limit must be requested separately.
If it is granted, the submission of the VAT advance declarations and the corresponding payments may take place one month later. However, in the case of monthly declarations, a special advance payment must be made.
This payment will be offset against the VAT liability established for the pre-registration period of December.
If an error is discovered, the entrepreneur must file a corrected VAT pre-declaration.
There is no "supplementary" VAT return.
Once the VAT return to be submitted by 31 May of the following year has been submitted to the tax office, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect VAT advance declaration, but only the incorrect annual VAT return.
Corrections to this VAT return to the advantage or disadvantage of the tax payer are possible within four years after the end of the year in which the first VAT return was filed.
After the expiry of this four-year period, a VAT return can normally only be corrected in cases of frivolous tax reduction or tax evasion.
Tax payers must submit their VAT pre-declarations electronically.
FÄ may grant exceptions to this rule in order to avoid undue hardship.
The annual VAT return can be submitted either in paper form or via the Internet with or without certification.
If the declaration is made without certification, the tax payer must also submit the declaration on paper and with his or her personal signature.
If no advance VAT declarations or returns are submitted, the tax administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the turnover achieved by the tax payer 6.
In the event of late filing, the taxpayer may be subject to a late payment surcharge (up to 10% of the tax liability or up to an amount of €25,000).
In an earlier audit, the BRH found that FÄ often do not levy this late payment surcharge.
In cases where the FÄ levied the late payment surcharges, the amount was fixed in a non-uniform and arbitrary manner.
The late payment surcharge therefore misses its purpose of reducing the average delay, in particular with regard to the filing of the annual VAT return.
The form of the VAT return contains separate lines for indicating the value of intra-Community supplies or acquisitions.
There are also separate lines for the purchase of services.
Non-taxable sales are to be stated in a separate line of the VAT return.
VAT returns submitted on paper must either be scanned or electronically recorded by specially designated personnel.
The data of electronically filed tax returns are directly available to the tax administration.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFT blank
After all data is collected electronically, it is subjected to a risk management procedure and a case selection is made on the basis of certain criteria.
The VAT returns selected in this way must be checked by the responsible clerk on the basis of the automatically generated audit notes (see 5.2).
Although the tax administration only has to make a rough estimate of the value added tax liability, it still has to be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, tax payers are required to file their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the end of the tax period.
Depending on the taxable person's turnover, the taxable period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
In Germany, tax payers have to file their pre-declarations no later than 10 days after the end of either the calendar quarter or the calendar month, depending on the amount of their tax liability for the previous year.
The annual VAT return must be submitted by 31 May of the following year at the latest.
The obligation to file an annual VAT return has some advantages and disadvantages:
+ After the end of the calendar year, the tax payer can correct the errors in the monthly advance declarations by filing a single VAT return;
- If the taxable person corrects his / her information on intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be attributed to a specific reporting period of the ZM;
- The federal states do not compare MIAS data on intra-Community acquisitions of German tax payers until the annual VAT returns have usually been processed.
According to the registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs must file a VAT return regardless of the amount of their turnover.
This duty will enable the German tax administration to verify compliance with the turnover ceiling for small business owners.
In addition, the competent FA can compare the annual VAT return with the corresponding declarations for direct taxes and with the annual financial statements of the company in question.
In the Czech Republic, the tax administration can check the amount of the turnover only on the basis of the submitted income tax return.
In contrast to the current regulations in the Czech Republic, German tax payers are obliged to submit their advance VAT declaration electronically.
The introduction of the requirement for electronic filing of tax returns in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech tax administration.
Summary messages
Submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic
In accordance with the provisions of Section 102 of Law No. 235 / 2004, an entrepreneur supplying goods to a person registered in another Member State for tax purposes is required to submit such summary declarations (hereinafter referred to as "ZM").
The value of the delivered goods is always stated in the ZM in Czech currency, broken down according to VAT number 7, the individual tax payers under which they are registered in the other Member State.
Information on services is not provided in the ZM.
Tax payers with a calendar monthly or quarterly taxation period must submit the ZM to the local tax authority no later than the 25th day after the end of each quarter.
Incorrect data must be corrected in a correction ZM within 15 days of the discovery of the error.
Incorrect data in the ZM will always be replaced by the data from the correction ZM.
Similar to the tax returns, tax payers can also file the ZM electronically.
If a tax payer does not submit a ZM or amending ZM, even though he is obliged to do so in accordance with Act No. 235 / 2004, the tax officer shall invite him to submit the relevant ZM, pointing out the consequences of non-submission. If non-monetary obligations are not fulfilled, the tax officer shall have the power to impose repeated fines of up to CZK 2 million in accordance with Section 37 of Act No. 337 / 1992.
The NKÚ's audit found that, in most cases, the FÄ did not use its power to impose fines on its defaulting taxpayers.
Particularly when handing over the ZM, the tax payers are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations, since the failure to hand over a ZM does not affect the amount of their VAT liability.
Pursuant to § 102 (5) of Law No. 235 / 2004, the tax officer is obliged to check the information in the ZM or Correction ZM, to remove any ambiguities and to use the information to determine the tax liability.
In case of disagreement
8 of the information in the ZM with which the tax payer corrects incorrect information in the ZM by submitting a corrective ZM either on his own initiative or upon request.
The tax officer shall correct the data on deliveries of goods to other Member States in the ATIS system if:
- the taxable person does not prove the accuracy of the information reported in the ZM (or correction ZM) and therefore corrects it by submitting a correction ZM,
- the tax official has proved the incorrectness of the information reported by the tax payer in the ZM or correction ZM.
Corrections entered by the tax officer without a correction ZM being submitted by the tax payer do not replace the duty of the tax payer to submit a correction ZM, but only lead to the correction of the data in the MIAS, so that they are up-to-date, complete and accurate.
The data from the ZM will be sent to the Member States concerned.
Only the national tax authority designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the field of turnover tax may transmit and receive this data.
This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic, this function is performed by the Department for International Mutual Assistance in the Field of Value Added Tax in the Ministry of Finance) and the "O _ MCTL" notification is automatically received by the CLO from the other Member States.
It contains all incorrect VAT ID numbers, which were specified in the transmitted ZM lines.
If the incorrect VAT ID number is used in some of the transmitted lines of the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry is made in the list of the incorrect VAT ID number.
The list includes a "Notice of Doubts Concerning VAT No."
The tax officer checks the data and enters the result of the check into the system.
When purchasing goods from another Member State, the taxable person must state this in his VAT return and enter the value of the purchase in the dedicated lines of the VAT return.
Selected cases of differences between the values of the purchases made indicated by the Czech tax payer in his VAT return and the values for the delivery of goods indicated by the supplier from the other Member State in his ZM will be forwarded by the CLO to the competent FA for examination.
The officials there will have to investigate the discrepancies.
Three different situations can then occur:
a) The value indicated by the Czech purchaser in the relevant headings of his VAT return is lower than the value of the deliveries indicated by suppliers from other EC Member States.
In this case, the tax officer checks the accuracy of the information.
b) The difference is zero.
This situation may arise either through a change in the information within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects his ZM) or through a change in the information in the VAT return (the Czech taxpayer submits a supplementary VAT return on his own initiative in the meantime).
In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax officer to check the accuracy of the information in the VAT return anyway.
c) The value of goods purchased from other Member States, as stated by the Czech taxable person in his VAT return, is higher than the value of their deliveries reported by the suppliers of the other EC Member States.
Again, it is at the discretion of the tax officer to verify the accuracy of the information.
After reviewing the differences and clarifying the reasons for their occurrence, the tax official enters the results of his review into ATIS.
These results will be sent to the CLO.
The number of transactions sent for audit by the CLO for the individual quarters of 2005 can be seen in Graph 1 (source: Czech Ministry of Finance).
Graph 1 above shows that the number of cases reported by the CLO to the FÄ for each quarter of 2005 has decreased.
The significant reduction in the number in the fourth quarter of 2005 is partly due to the fact that the Czech CLO has raised the threshold for case selection, taking into account the minimum limit for a request for information to the other EC Member States.
Deviations between the information in VAT returns and EC data do not always have to be due to an error on the part of the domestic purchaser.
There may also be an error on the part of the taxable person in another Member State, or an error caused by the fact that certain types of deliveries in the ZM are indicated differently in different EC Member States.
The most frequent reasons for deviations in the value of reported transactions found in the audited FÄ can be seen in Table 1.
Submission and processing of the summary reports in Germany
Entrepreneurs who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EC Member States or participate in triangular transactions must submit quarterly ZM in which the intra-Community deliveries are listed by purchaser (§ 18a (1) UStG).
The ZM must be handed in no later than the 10th day of the month following the calendar quarter in question.
If a permanent extension is granted for the submission of the VAT pre-declarations, this also applies to the ZM.
The ZM must be handed in to the CLO.
Since 1 January 2007, the electronic levy has been mandatory.
The relevant FA may allow exemptions for individual tax payers in order to avoid undue hardship.
If the tax payer determines that the ZM was faulty, he is obliged to submit a corrective ZM within one month.
In the event of non-surrender of the ZM, the CLO initiates an enforcement procedure.
This includes the following steps: - first reminder - second reminder, accompanied by the threat of a penalty payment and - setting of the penalty payment.
Although the German tax code allows penalty payments of up to €25,000 (§ 329 AO), the CLO sets penalty payments of €125, €250 and €500 in three stages.
In addition, § 26a (1) no. 5 UStG stipulates that the tax payer acts irregularly if he intentionally or recklessly does not submit a ZM correctly, completely or not in time, or if he does not correct a ZM or not in time.
This infringement can be punished by a fine of up to €5,000.
Data on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered into the MIAS by the FÄ, because the CLO is exclusively responsible for the processing of the ZM.
The data of the ZM are only saved at the CLO.
The data from the Summary Notifications will not be available to FÄ until they have been processed by the CLO.
The deadlines for processing ZM are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003.
The data of the ZM must be stored within three months of the relevant calendar quarter (in MIAS).
In the case of incorrect VAT ID number in the ZM of German tax payers, the German CLO will receive a message "O _ MCTL" from the other Member State.
The CLO then turns to the contractor and asks for the correct data.
If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case will be referred to the relevant FA.
It is then up to them to request the correct information.
In the course of its audit, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs corrected the VAT number at the request of the CLO.
However, reminding, threatening and fixing up to three consecutive penalty payments takes too much time when a tax payer may be involved in a cross-border carousel fraud.
The cases, which were eventually reported to the relevant FÄ, were usually closed within one to two months.
The respective IAs refused to grant exemption for the notified intra-Community deliveries in 73% of these cases 9.
If the taxman provided the correct VAT ID number, the FA asked him to submit a corrected ZM to the CLO, because the FÄ cannot correct the MIAS data itself.
The BRH found that neither the FÄ nor the CLO controlled the delivery of the corrected ZM.
Therefore, the tax payers often did not comply with the request. Since the CLO does not have access to the data of the VAT returns, there is no comparison of the data on goods deliveries made in the VAT pre-declarations or the VAT return with the corresponding data in the ZM before these data are forwarded to the CLO of the other Member States.
This comparison can only be carried out by the FÄ. This is usually done during the preparation of a special VAT audit.
Data received from other Member States will be processed by the CLO.
Incorrect VAT identification numbers will be identified and reported to the Member States concerned.
The data will be used for the control of income tax in the FÄ.
As soon as they are available in the system, the CLO matches them with data from previous calendar quarters.
If they fulfil certain criteria (see 5.2), control notices will be issued and sent to the relevant FÄ.
This is done on an ongoing basis, whereas a listing of the acquisition data of all persons subject to VAT is later prepared and forwarded to the FÄ.
The risk management system (RMS) for the assessment procedure then compares this data with those for intra-Community acquisitions.
The system fully checks (only) those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct VAT.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, tax payers who have made intra-Community deliveries to a person registered for VAT in another Member State must hand over a ZM to the local competent authority within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter.
The FÄ process the ZM and forward the data to the CLO.
The values of the intra-Community deliveries declared by the tax payers in the ZM are compared with the values of the intra-Community deliveries stated by the same tax payers in their VAT returns.
The results of the comparison will be taken into account when setting the tax.
In Germany, tax payers who have made intra-Community deliveries are obliged to submit quarterly ZM within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter10.
Since January 1, 2007, taxpayers have been required to submit the ZM electronically to the CLO.
The data from the ZM are only available to the FÄ after their processing at the CLO.
In both the Czech Republic and Germany, tax payers in the ZM state only the deliveries of goods.
The provision of services is not indicated in the ZM. Unlike the Czech FÄ, the German FÄ cannot correct incorrect information in individual lines of the submitted ZM itself.
Because of this limited access to the German MIAS data, incorrect VAT ID numbers were not corrected even if the tax payer reported the correct VAT ID number to the FA.
The German tax administration does not compare the information on intra-Community deliveries made by German tax payers in their VAT pre-declarations with the information provided by the relevant ZM.
Differences between the data of the pre-notification and the ZM are regularly not detected before the German CLO forwards the MIAS data to other Member States.
On the basis of these findings by the BRH, it is obvious that a comparison would improve the reliability of the MIAS data transmitted.
Data provided by other Member States on deliveries of goods to Czech tax payers will be compared in the Czech Republic with data on purchases of goods indicated by Czech tax payers in their VAT returns.
The Czech CLO makes the adjustment for each calendar quarter separately.
The most serious cases of deviations will be referred to the FÄ for examination.
Unlike the Czech tax administration, the German tax administration does not generally examine the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.
Such a general check will only be carried out on taxpayers who are not fully entitled to deduct VAT.
In addition, the German tax administration controls the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other tax payers only if the RMS draws up an audit report or the tax payer has been selected for an audit in any case.
This procedure relieves the FÄ of the need to clarify the reasons for differences that occur.
On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
In order to combat carousel fraud, up-to-date information on intra-Community purchases must be available as early as possible.
The current system of ZM, in particular MIAS, provides the tax authorities with information that may well be half a year old.
This time delay could be reduced to up to four months if taxpayers had to hand in monthly payments.
The monthly levy would only marginally increase the bureaucratic burden, since most tax payers in the Czech Republic and Germany are obliged to file monthly VAT returns or pre-declarations anyway, and no more information is required for the ZM than for the VAT returns or pre-declarations.
In order to avoid red tape, the submission of the ZM could be combined with the submission of the VAT returns or advance declarations.
However, a requirement to submit ZM on a monthly basis would cause more periodic discrepancies between information on intra-Community supplies and information on intra-Community purchases and would increase data flows between CLOs.
In 2006, the federal government considered the general introduction of monthly ZM.
The implementation failed due to the concerns of the federal states.
They feared that a monthly transfer of MIAS data to the CLO of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In order for the commitment to the monthly delivery of ZM to be effective, it is necessary to agree on the uniform monthly delivery at European level, so that a monthly update of the MIAS data is possible.
Statistical information on deliveries of goods and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany
In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.
The total turnover of intra-Community trade in goods between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Table 2.
Both courts of auditors requested data on the number of incorrect tax numbers or VAT ID numbers in the O _ MCTL reports exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for each of the audited quarters.
These data can be found in the tables below.
They have significant differences.
The reason for the differences may be a different calculation basis for the number of O _ MCTL messages.
While the Czech CLO refers the figures to the calendar quarter for which the ZM was submitted, the German CLO refers its figures to the calendar quarter in which O _ MCTL notification was received.
International exchange of information at level 3
Execution of the international exchange of information in the Czech Republic
The international exchange of information allows tax officials to obtain information from other Member States on intra-Community transactions as well as on the tax payers who have carried them out.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 on mutual assistance in the field of value added tax, which repealed Directive (EEC) No 218 / 92 (hereinafter "Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003"), distinguishes between two basic types of exchange of information: the exchange of information on request and the spontaneous exchange of information (without prior request).
The international exchange of information on request is carried out by means of a request for information (RFI) using the standard SCAC form.
Tax officials in the Czech Republic send their RFI or responses to a received RFI through the Finance Directorate to the CLO, which will translate the information provided in the standard SCAC form into the foreign language and forward it to the other Member States.
In addition, the CLO receives requests for information (RFI) from other Member States and replies to sent requests. It arranges their translation into Czech and their distribution to the relevant FÄ for processing.
Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 sets a time limit of no more than three months from receipt of the request for its processing.
All RFIs exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany during the audited period were audited by NKÚ.
Out of a total of 94 RFIs received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were processed within the three-month period; in a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) this period was exceeded.
In the remaining one case, no reply had been sent to Germany pending examination by the NKÚ. More detailed information on the time limits within which requests made by Germany were answered by the Czech Republic can be found in graph 2.
Out of a total of 335 requests for information (RFIs) sent to Germany from the Czech Republic, in 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) a reply was received within the three-month period; a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were processed after this period and in 19 cases no reply had been received from Germany at the time of examination by the NKÚ (in the remaining one case it was not possible to determine, based on the information provided, when Germany replied to the request for information).
More detailed information on the time limits within which requests for information from the Czech Republic were answered from Germany can be found in Graph 3.
The percentages of intra-Community turnover values indicated in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Graph 4.
The graph above shows that the turnover audited in connection with requests for information mostly had values in excess of €60,000.
The international exchange of information without prior request is either automatic, structured automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.
Tax officials in other Member States are often provided with information, without prior request, which is important for determining the VAT liability.
In the Czech Republic, all information is collected at the CLO.
The exchange of information between Member States is carried out electronically.
"Automatic exchange" in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 means the systematic transmission of pre-determined information to other Member States at regular, pre-determined intervals without prior request.
"Structured automatic exchange" means the systematic transmission of pre-defined information to another Member State without its prior request, as soon as the information in question is available.
The Czech Republic informs the other Member States in the automatic exchange of information on deliveries of new vehicles.
The tax officer obtains this information from the form notification of delivery of a new vehicle pursuant to § 19 of Act No. 235 / 2004 as well as from a copy of the issued invoice.
When processing this form, the tax officer enters the required data in the relevant document template and forwards it directly to the responsible employee of the Financial Directorate, where this data is collected and sent to the CLO for further processing. Afterwards, this data is transmitted to the other Member States within the prescribed period, i.e. no later than two months after the end of the quarter in which it was obtained.
The Czech Republic also provides other Member States with information on mail order transactions that are tax-free in the country of origin, on intra-Community transactions that appear to be illegal and on potential "missing traders."
This information will be sent to the other Member States by means of a SCAC form in a spontaneous exchange of information.
Execution of the international exchange of information in Germany
In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information originates from the local competent FA.
FÄ will send the completed SCAC 2004 form by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which will forward the SCAC forms to the foreign CLO.
The FÄ are instructed to write their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the SCAC form used is single-language.
Half of the German requests for information examined by the BRH were sent in order to ensure income taxation in the other Member State or to prove that intra-Community supplies from Germany to the other Member State are exempt from tax.
If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it will examine whether the value of the deliveries referred to in the request exceeds the minimum amount limit of €15,000.
If there is no reasonable justification for the request, the German CLO refuses to provide information regarding a turnover below the minimum amount limit.
In addition, the German CLO provides the translation of the freely formulated texts in the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)] if they are neither written in German nor in English.
In order to reply to the request for information, the CLO will forward it to the competent FA, referring to the three-month deadline.
No further deadlines have been set at the various levels of the German tax administration.
Although the German CLO has the technical means to monitor compliance with the deadline, it does not have the necessary human resources to remind the FÄ to respond to the unresolved requests for information.
The FÄ receive the required information by writing to the tax payer or carrying out an external audit.
The external auditors usually choose between two types of audit: the special value added tax audit, which covers all transactions subject to tax within a period of several months, or the so-called value added tax audit, which may only refer to a recent transaction.
With this short and ﬂexible form of audit, an announcement to the tax payer is not necessary and has proven its worth in the investigation of a single turnover.
In the case of the automatic exchange of information, Germany provides the other Member State with the following information: - on VAT identification numbers allocated to companies established in other EC Member States - on the refund of VAT to traders established in other EC Member States.
In addition, Germany has undertaken to provide the other EC Member States with the following information in the framework of the structured automatic exchange of information:
a. The supply of new vehicles to entrepreneurs without VAT number, b. Distance sales (mail order) to other EC Member States which are not subject to VAT in Germany, c. Significant discrepancies between the purchases reported by a tax payer and the MIAS data transmitted by other Member States, i.e. intra-Community deliveries of goods which have been inappropriately taxed in Germany by the tax payer, e. Potential "missing traders" who have made intra-Community transactions, regardless of whether their VAT number is still valid or has already been deleted, and f. Tax payers who have made intra-Community deliveries to potential "missing traders" or to customers who have misused a VAT number.
Comparison and evaluation
Requests for information or spontaneous information are sent both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the initiative of the local competent authorities, who send the relevant SCAC forms to the CLO.
Whereas the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCAC forms (Czech-English) and translates provided information into English or German, the German FÄ follow the instruction to draw up requests for information or spontaneous information on a monolingual form only in German.
The German CLO does not produce translations of German texts.
When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany between 1 May 2004 and 31 December 2005, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax administration completed 74.5% of the requests for information received within the three-month period, whereas the requests for information addressed to Germany were completed by the German tax administration only in 40.6% of cases within that period.
Although the German CLO notifies the FÄ of the three-month deadline, it does not monitor compliance with it.
As a result of the lack of reminders, there is a high proportion of time-limited requests for information.
For this reason, the BRH has recommended a continuous reminder procedure to the German CLO.
The situation has now changed.
According to the information available to us, the German CLO is now reminding the tax authorities to reply to the outstanding requests for information.
Value added tax risk management
Risk management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several organisational units at various levels of financial administration are involved in risk management in the area of value added tax.
Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organisational units are responsible for risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:
The Department of Methodology and Economic Management of Value Added Tax or its Risk Management Unit deals with the identification of potential risk areas for tax revenue and evaluates trends in these risks in domestic and intra-Community trade.
At national level, this unit coordinates the requirements for the "credibility of VAT returns" criterion and uses the MIAS data to detect possible tax evasion in the context of intra-Community supplies and purchases.
On the basis of data on the Czech Republic's trade balance, it evaluates high-risk goods, prepares conceptual risk management in the area of turnover tax and cooperates in this area with the relevant EC institutions and the other Member States.
The Department for International Mutual Assistance in the field of VAT provides inter alia for the exchange of information, contributes to the creation and maintenance of a relevant information database, evaluates the data available in the MIAS system from other Member States, carries out public relations work and is responsible for other forms of intergovernmental mutual assistance within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003.

The Tax Audit and Investigation Methodology Unit carries out, among other things, risk analyses in the context of the methodological management of tax audits, establishes priorities for the work planning of the financial directorates with regard to the selection of cases to be audited, prepares risk analyses to combat tax evasion and, in this context, collects information from the tax administration and other sources and makes proposals for measures to combat tax evasion.
Tax investigation units exist at the tax directorates. Their tasks include the search for tax payers and industries that are risky in terms of the frequency of tax evasion (e.g. Internet transactions, gold, pharmaceutical industry), the search for unregistered tax payers (e.g. in the sectors of Internet services, employment services, electronic and print media, etc.), the investigation of links in cases of chain fraud and the informing of local tax authorities.
Special examination units have been set up in 12 selected FÄ.
These have a regional competence and, on the basis of appropriate authorisation, also carry out tax audits outside the local competence of the FÄ.
The need to set up the special audit units arose from the increase in detected new and "improved" forms of tax evasion, particularly in the context of chain transactions.
These special units audit according to the needs of the tax investigation services or focus on tax payers with specific activities, multinational companies and tax payers with particularly high turnover.
The following mechanisms for reducing risks in the field of VAT have been integrated into the ATIS system: - the task of "Credibility of VAT returns" to assess the risk of tax returns filed; - the task of "Selection of tax payers to be audited," selecting the tax payers to be audited on the basis of certain criteria; - the task of "MIAS," which allows tax officials access to the data provided by the other EC Member States.
The "MIAS" task enables, inter alia, the following: - verification of the validity of the VAT ID number of tax payers from other Member States; - confirmation of the value of the goods delivered to a Czech tax payer as stated in the ZM by all suppliers of the tax payer in question from other Member States; - establishment of a list of tax payers who have not submitted a ZM; - formal control of the information provided by tax payers in the Czech Republic in their ZM before this information is transmitted to other Member States; - establishment of a list of tax payers whose VAT returns do not match the information on deliveries of goods to other Member States; - establishment of a list of tax payers whose VAT returns do not match the information on the value of goods purchased from other Member States in the ZM of all their suppliers from other Member States 13.
As part of their mission to combat tax evasion, tax officials have access to data held by public authorities such as commercial registers, land registers, motor vehicle registers, trade registers, etc.
More detailed information on this can be found in section 4.4.1 Submission and processing of the Summary Reports in the Czech Republic.
Risk management in Germany
Due to their federal structure, both the federal financial authorities (in particular the CLO) and the financial administrations of the 16 federal states are involved in the development and introduction of an RMS in the Federal Republic of Germany.
Although there are joint working groups for development, neither the CLO nor the financial administrations of the federal states have a fully uniform database.
At CLO level, Unit ST I 2 (hereinafter referred to as "KUSS" - Coordination Unit for Special Value Added Tax Audit and Tax Investigation Measures) collects the audit findings on cases of fraud in the OPUS database.
In cooperation with the countries, a further database called ZAUBER has been set up at KUSS. There, the tax offices can enter and also query the names of discovered missing traders or VAT fraudsters.
The KUSS coordinates both related cases of VAT fraud at national level and cases of cross-border VAT fraud.
The experiences of the KUSS will be brought into the development of the RMS through their participation in the working groups.
In addition, experts from several other organizational units of the CLO and the BMF are also involved.
The formal review of the composition of VAT No. of other Member States appearing in the ZM of German tax payers will be carried out at the CLO.
This formal review takes place prior to the transmission of the ZM to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of the MIAS data and thus its usefulness (see 4.4.2).
The validity of the VAT ID numbers mentioned in the ZM shall be checked on the basis of the O _ MCTL identifiers transmitted by the other Member States (for the procedure for correcting invalid VAT ID numbers, see also 4.4.2).
In addition, the CLO's RMS is based on the MIAS data provided by the other Member States and generates various types of notifications to detect suspected missing traders. Certain characteristics are used as clues, which usually occur in carousel transactions.
The Federal States are required to process these notifications and, in certain cases, to forward the outcome of their investigations to the CLO.
The audit by the BRH has confirmed that all available features must be taken into account in order to conclude with sufficient probability a case of tax fraud (rather than focusing mainly on the turnover of a company).
Accordingly, the BRH has recommended to the BMF to work with combinations of various indications in the preparation of the communications.
The risk management system should also take into account other indications, such as the payment behaviour of the tax payer, the sector of activity or the shareholding of the company.
A second level of risk management exists at the tax administrations of the federal states and focuses on the processing of VAT pre-declarations and annual returns.
For example, the system draws up a list of those tax payers who have indicated intra-Community supplies in their VAT declaration or annual declaration.
This list is sent to the CLO for the purpose of monitoring the complete surrender of the ZM.
Furthermore, in this type of risk management, the purchases indicated by the tax payer in his annual VAT return are compared with the data in the MIAS.
The tax administrations of the Länder avoid comparing the quarterly data, as this would result in too many inconsistencies due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud; for example:
- the supplier and the acquirer assume different dates for the execution of intra-Community transactions;
- different accounting recording and tax declaration of discounts and rebates.
In addition to comparing the information from the VAT returns with the MIAS data, many Länder have certain risk management mechanisms that are based on information in the VAT returns and certain other indications (e.g. the wording of the company, the age of the owners / partners, the number of employees and the method of payment of the tax payer).
Bavaria has introduced a risk management system based on fixed rules, which allows a team of specialists in the fight against tax fraud (hereinafter referred to as "risk managers") to program their own rules in such a way that suspected tax cheats are identified.
This system is used in the processing of VAT advance declarations by the FÄ.
Thus the competent FA receives the instructions of the RMS before the value added tax is determined.
Since this system is not capable of learning, risk managers have to adapt the rules according to the feedback from the FÄ.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has developed an adaptive neural network based on the data of detected evasion cases.
Based on this data, the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.
The system draws up a monthly list of tax cases where there is evidence of tax evasion.
On the basis of this list, the competent authorities decide on the examination of the tax payers concerned.
After the audit, tax auditors will have to report their results so that the RMS can learn from the results of the audits it proposes.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rule-based fuzzy system.
Based on a lot of data from processed VAT returns and a few other clues, this neuro-fuzzy system (also called data mining system) calculates how likely it is that a tax payer is involved in tax fraud.
It then draws up a monthly list of suspected tax cheats.
On the basis of this list, the FÄ select the tax payers concerned for audit and report the audit results to the data centre concerned.
The introduction of these three RMS is under way in the federal states.
Since each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three anti-fraud systems seems appropriate.
Whether the hoped-for effects will materialize during actual use remains to be seen.
Comparison and evaluation
Although it is not possible in this report to deal with the specific criteria of RMS in the Czech Republic and Germany, the NKÚ and the BRH have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.
Just like the different approaches in the three German federal states mentioned above, the RMS of each European state has its particular strengths and weaknesses.
There is currently an exchange of experience between the tax authorities of the European Member States on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.
VAT fraud - in particular carousel fraud - has not proved to be a national problem, but a European one.
The people involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one, but in several Member States.
A Member State alone cannot develop an effective RMS.
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EC Member State. If this does not happen, fraudsters choose the Member State with the weakest RMS for their crimes.
Tax losses caused by pan-European VAT fraud do not necessarily affect the Member State in which the initiator is established.
Any other Member State involved in the fraud may be affected.
That is why there should be a European exchange of experience on the RMS.
Selected results from the audit of individual sales In the context of the parallel audits, NKÚ and BRH examined the quality and usability of information on selected deliveries or
acquisitions that were the subject of international exchange of information between the tax administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.
In addition, the two audit courts jointly examined the processing of several deliveries, the execution of which was in doubt, or which the tax payers of both states declared differently in their tax returns or ZM.
At the request of the BRH, NKÚ examined a total of eight transactions between eight Czech and eight German tax payers.
In addition, in 43 cases, NKÚ audited the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany, which Czech tax payers had stated in their tax returns and ZM, on the basis of communications from BRH.
At the request of the NKÚ, the BRH checked a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech taxpayers.
The relevant information was exchanged solely on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 on the CLO.
The examination of the selected cases showed, among other things, that the different registration procedures in the EC Member States lead to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:
1.
According to the MIAS data, a Czech tax payer purchased goods worth €60,500 from a German tax payer in the third quarter of 2004.
When the Czech tax payer declared an acquisition of only €29,869, the Czech tax administration sent a request for information to Germany in order to check the value of the goods delivered.
In its reply to the Czech request for information, the German side stated that the German tax payer in question had delivered goods worth €27,381 to his Czech business partner in the second quarter of 2004, goods worth €31,997 in the third quarter and €10,276 in the fourth quarter.
It also emerged from the reply that the VAT ID number of the German tax payer was only valid as of 28 September 2004. However, the German CLO had granted a further application by the German tax payer and brought forward the validity of the VAT ID number retroactively to 1 May 2004.
The German tax payer corrected the ZM.
On the basis of this information, it was a (intra-Community) purchase of goods by the Czech tax payer.
In a request to the competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that in 2004 the Czech tax payer had filed supplementary VAT returns for the individual (under-year) tax periods in which he declared a higher value of purchases from other Member States and at the same time sought the deduction of input tax from purchases from other Member States.
On the basis of these additional VAT returns, the responsible clerk of the Czech Tax Office was not able to establish unambiguously whether the declared purchases also included the value of the deliveries from the above-mentioned German supplier.
In response to a request for information from the NKÚ, the BRH found that the German supplier had been registered as subject to VAT in September 2003.
At the time of registration, however, he had not applied for the allocation of a VAT ID number, but only of a tax number valid exclusively for Germany.
Although it is generally not possible in Germany to retroactively allocate a VAT ID number to a tax payer, this was done in 2006 by the responsible officer of the German tax administration with retroactive effect from 1 May 2004.
The German CLO allocates a VAT ID number retroactively if the German entrepreneur did not cause the delayed allocation; for example, if the CLO caused the delay after the tax payer applied for a VAT ID number.
In this case, the CLO grants the VAT ID number retroactively, because the entrepreneur does not require a valid VAT ID number for an intra-Community delivery in accordance with § 6 of the VAT Act.
Conversely, a German buyer does not need the (valid) VAT ID number of his supplier in order to declare the intra-Community acquisition.
Because of these procedural differences between the Member States, the German CLO granted the VAT ID number retroactively in this particular case.
2.
Within the framework of the international exchange of information, the Czech tax official requested the verification of the VAT registration of the German entrepreneur.
According to the MIAS data, the date of registration is March 5, 2005, while a registration certificate issued by the local German FA indicates October 1, 2004.
In their reply, the German authorities stated that the German tax payer had been registered on 1 October 2004 but, for organisational reasons, had only been allocated a VAT ID number in Germany on 16 February 2005.
Through a request to the local Czech tax official, NKÚ learned that the tax official had carried out a VAT audit of the Czech tax payer for the tax periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.
During this audit, the tax office found that the Czech tax payer had declared in his VAT return services to the value of CZK 9,897 which he had provided to the German tax payer prior to his VAT registration (i.e. before 1 October 2004).
The (Czech) Tax Office established a tax liability of CZK 1,880 to the Czech tax payer for the third quarter of 2004.
On the basis of the NKÚ request, the BRH found out that the German tax payer had only been allocated the VAT ID number when he registered his company, which was founded in 2004, with the FA on 16 February 2005.
In addition, the FA registered him retroactively from 1 October 200415 for VAT purposes in order to be able to monitor the filing of the 2004 VAT return.
In this VAT return, the tax payer stated intra-Community purchases from the Czech Republic to the value of €160 (approx. CZK 5,000).
3. In his VAT return for September 2004, as well as in his ZM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax payer stated deliveries of goods worth CZK 114,615 to a German tax payer.
When checking the registration of the German tax payer in the MIAS system, the Czech tax official found that this registration was only valid as of 11 November 2004 and thus after the goods had been delivered to Germany.
The Czech tax payer filed a supplementary VAT return in which he declared turnover from domestic deliveries in the amount of CZK 114,615 and VAT in the amount of CZK 21,777, which he paid.
Following a request to the local tax authority in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax payer subsequently submitted an application for the resumption of the taxation procedure in respect of the supplementary VAT return. As evidence, he submitted a confirmation from the German tax administration that the German tax payer had been registered since 1 January 2000.
Accordingly, the Czech tax official checked the validity of the registration of the German tax payer within the framework of the international exchange of information.
The German information showed that the German tax payer had not been assigned a VAT ID number until 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.
As a result, the Czech tax official rejected the request to reopen the taxation procedure.
The BRH found that, in this case, no intra-Community acquisition of goods had taken place because the German tax payer had only received a VAT ID number on 11 November 2004.
However, the German recipient declared both the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and the value-added tax thereon and also requested the reimbursement of the same amount of input tax.
Because this did not lead to a change in the amount of the tax liability of the German tax payer, the German tax official did not correct the information in the VAT return.
Furthermore, the BRH found that the company of the German tax payer named in the request for information was changed during the processing of the reply in Germany, which led to confusion between two German tax payers.
This change of name at the German tax office also confused the Czech tax official.
4.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax official verified the purchase of goods in the first quarter of 2005 by a Czech tax payer from a German tax payer to the value of €22,686.
Following a request to the local competent tax official in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ established that the Czech tax official had carried out an external audit with the Czech tax payer to ascertain whether the intra-community delivery had actually taken place and whether the Czech tax payer had booked and paid the invoice for the delivery of the goods.
The Czech tax payer did not declare the intra-community acquisition in his VAT return, because the German supplier did not state his VAT ID number in the invoice, but only his tax number intended for transactions within Germany.
According to the MIAS data, the German tax payer is not registered for VAT in connection with intra-Community transactions until 21 April 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech tax payer.
The Czech tax official also requested that the German tax administration send a copy of the registration certificate of the German tax payer so that he could, if necessary, initiate appropriate taxation proceedings.
The Czech FA considered this transaction to be the purchase of goods from a non-entrepreneurial (private) person in Germany and therefore did not impose value added tax on the purchase of the goods from Germany.
The BRH found that, under German law, a tax payer supplying goods to other Member States does not have to have a VAT ID number for intra-Community supplies in order to benefit from the VAT exemption for such a supply.
The supplier must only have the VAT number of the purchaser in the other Member State and be able to document the transport of the goods in question to the other Member State.
In this case, turnover under German tax law is a (tax-exempt) intra-Community supply which should be subject to acquisition taxation in the Czech Republic.
In any case, it is important that the Czech tax official took note of this transaction, because the delivery of a machine of this value was not part of the core business of the German supplier.
As described in section 4.6.2, the German CLO rejects requests for information on intra-Community transactions if they are below the minimum limit of €15,000: 5.
According to the MIAS data, a Czech tax payer purchased goods worth €12,561 from a German tax payer in the third quarter of 2004.
The Czech tax official carried out an audit for this tax period.
In the framework of intergovernmental mutual assistance, the Czech financial administration requested an audit of this supply of goods by means of an SCAC form.
The Czech tax payer stated that he had not received the goods, that he had never had any business relationship with the German company and that the purchase of the goods in question had not been recorded with him.
The German tax administration rejected the request for the transmission of documents - contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents - on the grounds that the turnover was less than €15,000 and no other justification had been given.
As the Czech tax official did not receive any documentation for subsequent taxation of the purchased goods, the tax audit was inconclusive and the original tax assessment remained in place.
On the basis of a request from the NKÚ, the BRH determined that the German tax payer acted as a "fiscal representative" 17 (§ 22 (a) - (e) UStG).
The German tax payer declared these deliveries in his VAT return and in the ZM.
His right to tax exemption was recognised.
On the basis of the notification by the BRH, the German FA will send the documents required for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods to the Czech Republic.
In section 4.6.1 it was shown that the replies of the German tax administration to requests for information exceeded the three-month deadline more often than the replies of the Czech tax administration:
6. During its audit, NKÚ found that, on 5 October 2005, the Czech tax administration had sent a request for information on the value of goods delivered to Germany in the fourth quarter of 2004.
In the ZM for this quarter, the German tax payer had reported a delivery of goods to the Czech tax payer to the value of €86,307; however, the Czech tax payer declared only the purchase of goods to the value of €35,314 in his VAT return for the same period.
In reply to the request for information received by the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after the expiry of the maximum processing period laid down in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003, the German side stated that the request for information could not be processed because the German company had been dissolved at the end of 2005.
Because the German tax administration did not meet the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the necessary documents for taxation in the Czech Republic.
7. In 2005, a Czech tax official used a SCAC form to request a review of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German tax payer worth €1,265,554 in the third and fourth quarters of 2004, on the basis of evidence of carousel fraud.
The NKÚ noted that at the time of its examination, a German reply to the request for information had not yet been received.
Following a request to the local tax officer, NKÚ found that the Czech tax payer had not declared in his VAT return the delivery of new motor vehicles to this German tax payer to the value of CZK 11,816,103.
The Czech tax official corrected the information in the tax return and the Czech tax payer submitted a corrected ZM.
Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not forward this request for information to the local FA for examination.
Following the notification by the BRH, a special VAT audit was carried out on the German purchaser in Germany. It was established that the purchase of all the motor vehicles concerned had been correctly taxed and that the vehicles were resold to other tax payers in Germany.
8. According to the MIAS data, the Czech tax payer purchased a car worth €48,500 from a German tax payer in the fourth quarter of 2004.
However, the Czech tax payer did not declare any intra-Community acquisition.
Through a request to the local tax official in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax payer had not filed a VAT return since August 2004.
The Czech tax payer did not file any tax returns even at the request of the tax official. As a result, on 23 May 2005, the FA set the value added tax liability for the period from October to December 2004 at zero.
On 2 June 2005, the CLO issued an instruction to examine the above-mentioned delivery from the German tax payer.
As the Czech tax payer did not cooperate with the tax official, he sent a request for information on the above-mentioned delivery to Germany.
As the reply to the request for information was not received until 7 February 2007, it was not known until the completion of the NKÚ audit how the Czech tax officer used the information obtained in the international exchange of information.
As a result of non-compliance with the provisions of the Czech Value Added Tax Act, the VAT registration of the Czech tax payer was cancelled with effect from 23 August 2005.
In some cases, only a partial reply was sent because, at the time of the examination of the NKÚ and the BRH, the competent FA had not yet completed the external examination:
9.
In 2005, the Czech tax official used a SCAC form to request a review of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German tax payer in the third quarter of 2004 for a value of €16,991, on the basis of evidence of carousel fraud.
In his reply to the request for information, the German tax official stated that he only had the invoices for deliveries to the value of €16,335 issued by the Czech taxpayer.
On the basis of the NKÚ request, the BRH found that the external audit carried out by the German FA on the buyer in Germany had not yet been completed.
The German acquirer declared the purchase of goods worth €16,335 twice in its preliminary VAT declarations for the months of August and September 2004.
10. In 2005, a Czech tax official used a SCAC form to request a review of deliveries of motor vehicles to a German tax payer worth €198,167 in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, with evidence of carousel fraud.
The German tax administration sent a partial reply to the request for information to the Czech Republic, in which it confirmed that the German taxpayer had purchased several motor vehicles and that the investigation in Germany had not yet been completed.
The NKÚ found that the local FA had carried out several external audits of the Czech tax payer in order to verify the deduction of above-average input taxes.
However, an unjustified claim has not been established.
The BRH found that the German tax payer had declared in his VAT returns for the period in question the purchase of goods from other Member States with a total value of €579,114, and that the examination of the German FA with the purchaser in Germany has not yet been completed.
In section 4.4.1, the reasons for discrepancies between the declaration of intra-Community purchases in the recipient's VAT return and the information in the supplier's ZM are described.
In the cases examined, it emerged that periodic discrepancies 18 or the incorrect declaration of a turnover as an intra-Community delivery of goods were not the most common reasons for the differences:
11.
According to the data from MIAS, the Czech tax payer purchased goods worth €35,716 from the German tax payer in the first quarter of 2005; however, the Czech tax payer did not declare this acquisition.
As the Czech tax officer did not cooperate with the tax officer and there was no business activity at the legal domicile of the company, the Czech tax officer requested, within the framework of the international exchange of information, to verify how the German tax officer had communicated with the Czech one.
The German reply to the request for information revealed that, according to the findings of the German tax administration, the Czech tax payer was unknown at the specified address and the goods were picked up by an agreed forwarding agent.
The total value of the order was €155,000, but the German taxpayer delivered only €21,659 worth of goods.
The Czech tax payer sent the German tax payer a false confirmation of payment for the amount of €155,153 in favour of the German tax payer.
After exposing the fraudulent behaviour of the Czech purchaser, the German tax payer, with the support of his other Czech clients, was able to recover the supplied material, with the exception of a part worth €7,916.
Following a request to the local authority in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that, on the basis of the information received from the Czech tax payer, the tax administration subsequently taxed sales of goods from other Member States in the amount of CZK 388,522.
Following a request from NKÚ, BRH confirmed that, after corrections, the German supplier had reported only one shipment of goods to the Czech tax payer to the value of €7,916.
In accordance with German legislation, the German tax payer declared the reversal of the delivery and the reduction of the tax base in the quarter of the reversal.
His ZM contained the following information relating to the Czech taxpayers:
12.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax administration used a SCAC form to request a review of the delivery of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005.
According to the request for information, during the period in question, the Czech taxpayer supplied the German taxpayer with goods with a total value of €396,126 and provided services with a value of €11,885.
The NKÚ found that the Czech tax administration had carried out an audit of the Czech tax payer in order to investigate this shipment.
In response to the request for information, the Czech tax administration announced that the Czech tax payer had supplied and installed a production plant to the German one.
The Czech taxpayer supplied the individual parts of the production plant prior to the accession of the Czech Republic to the EC, and the production plant was assembled on the basis of the order after 1 May 2004.
The German tax payer did not take delivery of the assembled production plant and claimed defects.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech tax payer charged the German for the production plant for €107,100 and €11,885 for services.
The German taxpayer received the invoices, but did not recognise them and did not pay them.
Following a request to the local tax official in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ established that all invoices had been correctly entered in the books of the Czech tax payer.
The VAT returns for the third quarter of 2005 contained only the amounts documented by the Czech tax payer and related to invoices invoiced after the first of May 2004.
The BRH found that, on the basis of the reply from the Czech tax administration, the locally competent FA concluded that these transactions constituted a uniform (goods) supply of the Czech tax payer to the German one, including the assembly carried out.
In this particular case, the place of performance of this so-called factory delivery is the place where the production plant is assembled.
The German recipient of the delivery of the work owes the value added tax in accordance with the German VAT Act.
At the same time, the recipient can claim a deduction of the same amount of VAT.
Since the turnover tax liability of the German tax payer remained unchanged, the German FA did not initiate a correction of the turnover tax return.
13. According to the MIAS data, Czech tax payer A purchased a machine worth €58,000 from German tax payer C in February 2005.
The Czech tax official sent a request to Germany for verification of this information.
In response to the request for information, the German side stated that the German tax payer C had delivered this machine to Czech tax payer B in 2004, who, however, returned it to German tax payer C in October 2004.
According to information from the German tax administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but to the establishment of the German tax payer C in the Czech Republic.
It also emerged from the reply to the request for information that the German tax payer C had delivered the machine to the Czech tax payer A in February 2005.
He received the machine at the headquarters of the branch of the German tax payer in the Czech Republic.
Since this delivery (from C to A) took place only within the Czech Republic, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods.
Following a request to the local tax officer responsible for tax payer B, NKÚ established that, according to the MIAS data, German tax payer C had delivered goods (another machine) worth €88,027 to the Czech tax payer in the third quarter of 2004.
Tax payer B stated that he had not received the goods, so the local Czech tax official sent a request for information to Germany.
The answer was that the machine had been delivered.
In the course of further investigations with tax payer B, the tax official found that the machine with a value of €88,027 had not been booked with tax payer B and that it could be the same type of machine as that supplied by the branch of German tax payer C to Czech tax payer A in February 2005.
The NKÚ also found that the Czech tax officer with local responsibility for tax payer A had carried out an audit on the latter.
The tax official had the invoice of the German tax payer C dated February 7, 2005, in which the tax payer A is indicated as the recipient of the machine.
The Czech tax official found that tax payer A had not accounted for this invoice.
Tax payer A had entered into a lease agreement with another Czech company, the subject of which was a machine of the same type.
The leasing company delivered the machine on February 9, 2005 and also took care of the transport.
The Czech FA did not use the information provided in the reply to the request for information to determine the tax liability of tax payer A.
The BRH found that the German tax payer C had delivered the machine, worth €88,027, not to the Czech Republic but to another German tax payer D.
Accordingly, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods, but a tax-liable delivery within Germany.
Consequently, the German tax official did not recognise the entitlement of the German tax payer C to VAT exemption and corrected the information in his tax return.
The German controller D delivered the machine to the Czech controller B.
Under German law, this delivery was not subject to tax in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.
The BRH also noted that the German tax payer C had indicated in his ZM for the first quarter of 2005 the delivery of a machine worth €58,000 to the Czech tax payer A.
This delivery was not checked during the tax audit carried out by the German FA.
The following figure represents the contractual relations between the business partners involved in the above-mentioned transactions.
14.
In examining requests for information received, NKÚ found that the Czech tax administration had received a request for information from Germany on 4 October 2005, in which a German tax official requested the verification of intra-Community supplies of a German tax payer worth €879,680,625 to a Czech tax payer.
The German tax official stated that there was a suspicion that this was a fictive intra-Community supply of goods.
The German tax payer had not carried out any active business activity since 1999.
The NKÚ found that the Czech tax official had carried out an external audit of the Czech tax payer.
The head of the Czech company stated that this was probably a claim by the German tax payer against the German tax administration, which the Czech tax payer, as a shareholder in the German company, had asserted to the German FA.
According to the information provided to the NKÚ, the Czech tax official has so far no information that the German tax administration is handling the case with reference to the Czech tax payer.
The available information indicates that it was not a delivery of goods; nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored in the MIAS as an intra-Community delivery of goods from Germany to a Czech tax payer.
The main reason for these discrepancies was the failure to indicate the intra-Community acquisition in the tax returns of the recipients (see also section 4.4.1):
15. According to the MIAS data, a German tax payer supplied a Czech tax payer with goods with a total value of €33,205 in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005.
However, the Czech tax payer did not declare the intra-Community acquisition.
The Czech tax official requested an examination of the delivery of goods from Germany within the framework of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In its reply to this request for information, the German side stated that the German tax payer had sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech tax payer and that the latter had personally collected the remaining goods.
Through a request to the local Czech finance official, the NKÚ established that the Czech tax payer had submitted a supplementary VAT return for the period in question before receiving a reply to the request for information.
Nevertheless, the differences regarding the values of the acquisitions could not be clarified, so the Czech tax official recommended a tax audit of the Czech tax payer.
This audit has not yet been carried out.
16. According to the MIAS data, a German tax payer had delivered goods worth €46,854 to a Czech tax payer in the third quarter of 2004.
For the same period, a Czech tax payer declared the intra-Community acquisition of goods worth only €14,856.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech tax official asked for verification of the actual value of the shipment.
With the German reply to this request, three invoices were sent showing a total value of the delivered goods of €31,999, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech tax payer and the MIAS data.
In a request to the local Czech tax official, NKÚ found out that, after receiving the reply from Germany, he had contacted the accountant of the Czech tax payer and remained with her in such a way that, after checking the invoices, she wanted to discuss with the company owner the filing of a supplementary VAT return for the third quarter of 2004.
So far, no supplementary sales tax return has been filed.
The Czech tax official informed the NKÚ that he would proceed in such a way that the deadlines for setting VAT retroactively for the tax period in question would be respected.
17.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German taxable person delivered goods worth €11,600 to the German taxable person.
In the context of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the German tax official asked for verification as to whether the aforementioned Czech tax payer actually existed, since the alleged capital owner of the German tax payer had set up a number of bogus companies in Germany.
In the course of the FA's review of the transaction, the Czech tax payer confirmed the purchase of the goods.
According to the Czech tax payer, however, the goods were not delivered from Germany to the Czech Republic, but were resold in Germany in 2005.
The Czech tax payer submitted receipts for the sale in January 2005.
The Czech tax payer was not registered as liable for VAT in Germany and had not paid tax on the sale of the goods in question either in the Czech Republic or in Germany.
All these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany and the Czech tax official provided this information in his reply to the request for information to the German tax administration.
Following a request to the local Czech tax officer, NKÚ established that, following a tax audit, the Czech tax payer had filed a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004, in which he declared, inter alia, the value of the goods he had acquired from a German tax payer and at the same time exercised the right to deduct VAT for purchases from other Member States.
In his Czech VAT return, he did not declare VAT on the sale of goods in Germany.
On the basis of a supplementary VAT return, which had been submitted after the external audit, the Czech tax official fixed the VAT liability unchanged.
According to Czech legislation, there was no purchase of goods from other Member States in this case, as the goods were not shipped or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.
Thus, the Czech tax official drew the wrong conclusion during the external audit.
The BRH found that immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information, which showed that the goods had not left Germany, the German tax official corrected the tax return of the German tax payer and demanded the payment of VAT to the value of €1,600.
In addition, the competent IAs sent a control notice to the IAs responsible for the actual recipient of the goods in order to ensure that the resale of these goods is properly taxed.
In the following cases, traders declared intra-Community deliveries that may not have been carried out:
18.
The Czech tax official received a request for information from the German tax administration on the question whether the Czech tax payer had purchased a car worth €47,400 from the German tax payer in February 2005.
Attached to the request for information was a copy of the VAT registration certificate of the Czech tax payer.
As a further attachment, a photocopy of the passport was attached to the person who was supposed to have transferred the vehicle.
In the course of his investigation, the Czech tax official found that the passport had been stolen, that the person named in it had not imported a vehicle into the Czech Republic and stated that he had not had any contact with a German tax payer.
The VAT registration certificate, the print of which had been sent by the German side, had not been issued by the Czech tax administration.
With this information, the Czech tax official responded to the request for information and at the same time stated that he could not confirm the purchase of the car.
On request to the local Czech tax official, NKÚ established that the Czech tax payer does not have his registered office at the address specified in the Commercial Register and that the managing director of the company cannot be reached.
Following a tax complaint procedure for the tax period of February 2005, the Czech tax official set the tax liability of the Czech tax payer at zero.
In the course of a further investigation, the Czech finance official found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had purchased it on the basis of an Internet advertisement.
The BRH found that the local German tax official had rejected the claim of the German tax payer to exempt that delivery from VAT on the basis of the Czech reply to the request for information.
19. In the course of an external audit, a German FA was not in a position to clarify a difference of €3,000 between the value of the purchased goods stated in the VAT return and the reported values from other Member States.
A Czech tax payer was alleged to have delivered goods worth €89,424 to a German tax payer in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005.
Since the acquisition declared by the German tax payer did not correspond to the MIAS data, the German tax official requested the verification of the deliveries and their payment within the framework of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In his reply to the request for information, the Czech tax official stated that the sole managing director of the Czech company had been deleted from the commercial register on 8 July 2005 and that a new managing director had not yet been registered.
The German recipient of the goods was presumably a relative of the shareholder of the Czech company.
The Czech tax payer submitted a VAT return and a ZM, which had been signed by an unauthorised person, namely this shareholder of the company, after the managing director had been deleted from the commercial register.
The accountant of the Czech tax payer informed the tax official that the owner of the capital had paid the payment received for the invoiced goods in euros into the company's account.
Cash receipts were not issued.
In a request to the local Czech FA, the NKÚ found that the tax official recognised the Czech tax payer's entitlement to VAT exemption for deliveries of goods to other Member States to the value of CZK 1,326,307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 in the first quarter of 2005.
The BRH found that the German tax official did not correct the VAT return of the German acquirer, since in the meantime a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German tax payer.
Since the earlier external audit had shown no evidence of tax fraud, there was no prospect of actually being able to collect a fixed VAT liability.
20. According to the MIAS data, a German taxpayer purchased goods from the Czech Republic to the value of €4,251,196 in 2005, after having purchased goods to the value of €43,274 in the previous year.
The German tax payer declared the intra-Community acquisitions neither in his 2004 VAT return nor in that for the year 2005.
In addition, he did not declare baseline sales in terms of value.
Because of these discrepancies, the German FA submitted a request for information concerning the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006.
In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-Community deliveries with a total value of CZK 167,246,083.
On 6 September 2006, the request for information was received, in which the German side requested to verify whether the delivery notified by the Czech taxpayer had actually taken place.
In response to this request for information, the Czech tax administration stated that the German request could not be complied with because the Czech company did not have a managing director (or other legal representative).
Documents provided to the NKÚ by the competent tax officer show that, together with the managing director of the Czech tax payer, a record of the start of the VAT audit for the fourth quarter of 2004 and the period from January to December 2005 was drawn up on 30 March 2006.
At the same time, the tax payer was asked by the tax officer to provide all the accounting and tax documents for that period, but failed to do so.
According to the Commercial Register, the term of office of the sole managing director had expired on 16 May 2005 without a new managing director being appointed.
The Czech tax payer has not filed any sales tax returns since April 2006.
As part of the parallel investigation, NKÚ, in cooperation with the BRH, investigated several cases of intra-Community deliveries between the Czech Republic and Germany which were not the subject of a prior exchange of information between the two countries.
The two Courts of Auditors exchanged information on the audited cases through the CLO of both countries.
21. A Czech company (UCR), which is not established in Germany, informed the competent FA (Chemnitz-Süd) that it wished to conduct tax-liable business in Germany.
Based on this information, the company was registered as of June 2005, but did not receive a German VAT ID number.
The (UCR) accepted an order from a Danish company (UDK) for the production of wind turbines and their delivery to Austria on behalf, at the risk and for the account of the Danish customer.
Due to insufficient in-house production capacity, the Danish company passed on part of the order to a German tax payer (UDE) based in Germany.
The following figure shows the contractual relations and the transport route of the wind turbines:
According to German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:
- The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines to Austria for installation on its behalf, at its own risk and for its own account.
Because of the assembly, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the delivery of the wind turbines is controllable in Austria.
- Because the freight forwarder was commissioned by the Danish company (UDK) and the latter had the transport carried out in its own name, at its own risk and for its own account, the place of delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE) is where the transport began, i.e. in Germany.
Although the wind turbines were supplied to another EC Member State (AU) and the recipient is registered as liable for tax in an EC Member State (CR), no tax exemption could be claimed for the supply of the German sub-contractor (UDE), since the EC Member State for which the supply was intended is different from the home state of the Czech company19.
Accordingly, the delivery is duly taxed in Germany, and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the deduction in its VAT returns.
The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) also depends on the place where the transport started.
However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.
- The delivery of wind turbines manufactured in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
- The delivery of the remaining wind turbines manufactured in Germany took place in Germany.
Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) provided both intra-Community supplies from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-Community supplies from Germany to Austria.
The BRH found that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare intra-Community deliveries either in its German tax returns or in its ZM submitted to the German CLO.
As a result, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-Community supplies uniformly as intra-Community supplies from the Czech Republic.
The NKÚ found that (UCR) did not notify intra-Community deliveries to Austria, but intra-Community deliveries to Denmark.
In order to ensure the taxation of intra-Community purchases in Austria, cooperation between at least four tax administrations (the Austrian, Czech, Danish and German) would be required, although in this case there is no evidence of tax fraud or evasion.
In addition, the NKÚ and BRH examined case scenarios in order to show the size of the differences between the information in the VAT returns and the MIAS data caused by the different legislation of 2004.
The cases examined also show that it will take some time for the taxpayers and the FÄ to apply the new legal requirements:
22. In his ZM for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004, a Czech tax payer reported deliveries of goods with a total value of CZK 792,977,452 to a German tax payer.
During the same period, another Czech tax payer reported in his ZM intra-Community deliveries to another German tax payer for a total value of CZK 18,157,265.
From the information provided by the BRH to NKÚ, it emerged that in both cases electricity supplies were involved.
Both Czech tax payers took into account the above-mentioned deliveries in their ZM in accordance with Czech Law No. 235 / 2004, which was in force in 2004.
In a further examination of these transactions, an audit group of NKÚ found that, in 2004, different legal regulations applied between the Czech Republic and Germany on the supply and purchase of electrical energy.
Whereas in the Czech Republic the tax payers declared the deliveries of electrical energy as intra-Community deliveries in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 235 / 2004 in force in 2004, according to the German legal provisions in force in 2004 it was not an intra-Community purchase of goods, but taxable and taxable transactions in Germany.
The differences in legal provisions have been eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Act No. 635 / 2004, which amended certain tax provisions with effect from 1 January 2005.
23. During the examination of intra-Community supplies or acquisitions in cooperation with the BRH, it was further established that a Czech tax payer declared intra-Community supplies to a German tax payer totalling CZK 240,411,163 in his ZM for the first and fourth quarters of 2005 and another Czech tax payer declared intra-Community supplies to another German tax payer totalling CZK 263,470,776 in his ZM for the same period.
Information provided by BRH to NKÚ showed that in both cases supplies of electrical energy had been involved.
In accordance with the wording of Law no. 235 / 2004 in force from 1 January 2005, the place of performance for the supply of electrical energy is the place where the purchaser has his legal domicile, place of business or place of business for which this supply is made.
Therefore, the Czech taxpayers should not have declared the electricity supplies in their ZM for 2005.
The fact that both taxpayers treated the supply of electrical energy in their ZM as intra-Community supplies resulted in a difference in the amount of CZK 503,881,939 in MIAS.
Final note
Through cooperation, the goals of the BRH and the NKÚ were achieved.
Both courts of auditors gained in-depth knowledge of VAT administration systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The cooperation revealed differences in the two systems and in the legal regulations governing the VAT administration.
During the parallel investigations, interesting cases of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions came to light.
With some of them it is worth further observation.
On the basis of the results of the audit, both courts drew up recommendations on the management of value added tax.
The follow-up of these recommendations in the form of a control review should be part of the follow-up.
The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of the two courts of auditors will form the basis for the successful conduct of future audits in the field of VAT administration.

The far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report in the daily "O Globo."
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make any public appearances in the South American country in the final week before presidential elections.
The politician was attacked in the street during a campaign rally in southern Brazil in early September.

Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations in particular had called for protests against the ex-military.

Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests mixed with a rally by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers "Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.

Rock night in the shoe factory: volume at jackhammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and ignite a concert evening with the power of a tiger." The band names of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" alone suggest such a description of the rocking live music experience on Saturday night in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: pure hard rock by three bands who are friends with each other.
After the sound check and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There was no sign of stage fright.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - and their bands loudly inspire the 120 or so visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with front man and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince at the beginning of the concert evening also with newest, unknown pieces written by themselves and the soon to be released CD.
In front of the stage, the audience dances to the harmonious and powerful interplay of the band.
Although "encore" shouts can't be ignored, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand."
Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate that hard rock is not the same as hard rock with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers," "Here We Stand" also uses a synthesizer in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only the yearning, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" impresses with the change from melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen, meanwhile, has gained a special degree of recognition since its foundation in 2005.
Full of agility, the band presents their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has special stage experience with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China in 2017 - is obvious and unmistakable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also sets his own accents in collaboration with the band on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
In the meantime guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a highly acclaimed solo to the sound that feels even higher than before, whereby he runs through the audience.
A certain volume is, of course, part of the genre at such a hard rock concert: at the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the mixing desk team, the three-way concert of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is approximately at the level of a pneumatic hammer, but is still significantly below the levels of the "Wacken Fesitval," which "The Ignition" refer to on their website.
Deafening 120 decibels in jet engine volume as usual at the annual Metal rendezvous in the north of the Republic, however, the Ahlen audience does not need this rock night.
After just under four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocking pace have long since convinced with their confident, virtuoso playing and their own compositions.

Trump adores Kim: "And then we fell in love"
It is no secret that the US president is sympathetic to North Korea's leader Kim, despite the nuclear crisis.
Now, however, Trump has made a veritable declaration of love for his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters."
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has confessed to a new flame.
The tragedy is that it is a long-distance relationship.
In public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
In front of supporters in the US state of West Virginia, Trump had almost tender words for the half-old scion of Pyongyang's ruling dynasty, even though he is proving to be quite a tough chunk in the struggle for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
"I was tough, so was he, and it went back and forth between us," Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And it wasn't just the talks with Kim that would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.

The US president seemed well aware that the affection for the "Rocket Man" - Trump's nickname for Kim - notorious for his martial threatening gestures might not be to everyone's taste.

Laschet calls for rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has called for the rule of law in Turkey in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to his own statement.
Relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed," Laschet said on Saturday after meeting Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This concerns in particular waves of arrests, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He had therefore "made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalise in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this."
According to Laschet, he also addressed the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He had expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan then again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan was moved at short notice to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence's flight readiness at Cologne airport.
Originally it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn - but the owners of the castle had refused to do so out of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the talks, Erdogan travelled on to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.

Lack of trust in US: North Korea makes demand for disarmament
While US President Trump never tires of emphasizing the successes of negotiations on North Korea's denuclearization, the East Asian regime presents a more sober picture.
Foreign Minister Ri is calling for a concession from Washington.
At the UN General Debate, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho accused the US government of using its continued sanctions to block negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
"The recent stalemate comes as the United States is relying on coercive measures that are lethal to confidence-building," Ri said in New York.
Under these circumstances, disarmament would be unthinkable for North Korea.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances, there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," the North Korean chief diplomat said.
That punitive measures could "bring North Korea to its knees" is "a pipe dream of people who don't know us."

After the Turkish President strongly criticised the treatment of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the DFB chief defended the FA line.
In the early hours of Sunday morning, Grindel, who was personally attacked by Özil, announced the consequences of the cause in Mainz's ZDF "sports studio."
"In the future - because we also have a lot of players with a migrant background in the U-teams - we have to draw very precise conclusions that something like this will not happen again," said the 57-year-old and wants to recruit an international without a migrant background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had strongly denounced racism towards Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.

They excluded them from this society because they allowed themselves to be photographed with me in England, "Erdogan said Saturday in the cathedral city.
To be honest, as their president, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who have risen to the top of the German national team, were marginalised.
Grindel pointed to Gündogan's statement that, in contrast to Özil, he felt "sensibly treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which began with photos of the two of them with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced his intention to stand in front of players in the future.
For someone to say: If I win, I am German, if I lose, I am a migrant - that is not possible.
"I very much regret that he has such an impression," Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I've always said that.
But he also does not see a basis for Özil's return to the national team.
As a consequence, in addition to Brazilian-born Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration officer is now to be appointed.
"If someone without a migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says," The issue is important, we have to take care of it, "that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration has to work," Grindel said.
Despite the criticism of himself after the World Cup exit and the Özil affair, he intends to run for president of the DFB again next year.
"I'm doing my job and trying to do it as well as I can," Grindel said.

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be removed only with explicit consent, stresses Swisstransplant.
(AP) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should make organ donation easier and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
People who wish to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be called up by Swisstransplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be removed - as in Germany - only with explicit consent, stresses Swisstransplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five per cent of cases would a card be found at the crucial moment with potential donors.
In more than 60 per cent of conversations, relatives do not know the wishes of the deceased.
"They then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very stressful," Immer said.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman of the Federal Agency for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert, says.
"There is no register where people can register their wishes - for or against organ donation," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken out in favour of a new regulation of organ donation.
Under his proposal, anyone would initially be considered an organ donor, unless they or relatives object.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.

Knicks connect scattered habitats as corridors through which the exchange of organisms can still function, as Ingo Ludwichowski, managing director of the German Nature Conservation Union (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were founded on an order of the Danish King Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundaries and cattle fences, they also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
His name "Knick" also dates from that time: by "bending" the branches, the dense, intertwined demarcations were able to develop.
Today, some 45,000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, giving the impression of a woody, variously structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used as a substitute habitat by around 7,000 animal species.
Up to 1800 different species could live in one kilometre of bend and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, the kink can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is properly maintained in winter.
Otherwise, it atrophies to a light row of trees, which, in addition to biodiversity, also loses the wind protection effect, Ludwichowski said.

After Sulawesi tsunami, Indonesian man talks about sighting on the ground
In an interview with the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND), local resident Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and tsunami:
Have you been there yourself during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I found out about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived there on Sunday morning, because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, because the airport on Palu was closed at that time.

The national government has reopened the airport so that relief supplies can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, which are all completely destroyed.

A prison has also been destroyed, some of the prisoners are walking around freely and the search for them is difficult.

It requires a high level of organisational, technical and financial effort.
When building and developing a sustainable European transport infrastructure, difficult compromises often have to be made with European and national policy objectives, such as preserving the environment.
It is precisely because of the necessary environmental protection measures that the construction of the transport infrastructure is complex.
When planning and awarding the construction of transport routes, administrations can save considerable financial resources and use them for other useful purposes through careful action and decision-making.
One of the tasks of state audit authorities is to identify deficiencies that prevent optimum economy, cost-effectiveness and efficiency in spending on the construction of transport facilities.
The audit authorities should not only draw the attention of the administrations to the shortcomings identified, but also make suggestions for improvement for the benefit of citizens and Europe.
Summary
In 2005 and 2006, the two Supreme Audit Institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic, the Federal Audit Office (BRH) and the Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad (NKÚ), conducted parallel audits of expenditure for the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway (the D 8 motorway in the Czech Republic and the A 17 motorway in the Federal Republic of Germany).
The two motorways are connected by a border bridge jointly financed by the two states.
The cooperation with the NKÚ enabled the BRH to carry out an in-depth examination of the cost-effectiveness of the use of funds in the construction of the border bridge.
In the course of cooperation with BRH, NKÚ obtained data from German bridges and tunnels for its own cost comparisons.
In 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany concluded a contract for the construction of the border bridge.
In line with the progress of the planning, the date of completion was finally set at the end of 2006.
During the award procedure, however, mistakes were made by the Road and Motorway Directorate of the Czech Republic (RMD), which delayed the procedure and shortened the available construction time.
The contract with the contractor was therefore concluded later than planned.
The contractor assured the accelerated construction of the bridge by the end of 2006.
For this, however, RMD had to accept considerable additional costs.
As part of the joint audit, the prices of motorway bridges on the D 8 and A 17 were compared. The benchmark for the price comparison of the bridges was the size of the bridge area.
A price analysis using statistical methods identified bridges with high costs per square metre.
The analysis showed that the border bridge was the most expensive of the large bridges with lengths of more than 100 m.
This was also due to the increase in prices as a result of delays in awarding contracts.
A comparison of the prices of the tunnels showed that the prices of the tunnels in the course of the D 8 are considerably higher than the prices of comparable tunnels in Germany.
In future audits of the economic viability of transport infrastructure expenditure, both BRH and NKÚ will be able to rely on a database of bridge and tunnel prices.
Both courts recommend that bridge structures should be standardised and that steel composite and special structures should only be carried out where prestressed concrete structures are inappropriate.
The course of the examination was characterised by teamwork and an open approach.
During the parallel examination, the examiners from both sides exchanged their expertise and skills.
Introduction
This report deals with parallel reviews of expenditure on the construction of the motorway from Dresden to Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).
The focus of the audit was on economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of funds.
The parallel tests were carried out by BRH in Germany and NKÚ in the Czech Republic
in 2005 and 2006.
The NKÚ assessed the economy, economy and effectiveness of expenditure on the cross-border section 0807 of the D 8 motorway in the amount of approximately CZK 20 billion gross (approximately €690 million).
Of this amount, €64 million will come from the EU Structural Funds (ISPA).
The BRH had already examined the planning and construction of the A17 motorway in the years 2003 to 2005, independent of the parallel tests with the NKÚ.
Of the budget of around €670 million for the construction of all three sections of the A17, €277 million will be co-financed by the European Funds (ERDF).
The Prague-Dresden motorway is part of the Pan-European Corridor IV Dresden - Central and South-Eastern Europe - Istanbul.
The D 8 runs from Prague via Usti nad Labem to the Czech / German border,
the A 17 from the border to Dresden.
At the time of the audit, the border sections of the motorways were under construction.
Both sections were opened to traffic on 21 December 2006.
While the motorway is thus completed on the German side to Dresden, the D 8 remains incomplete on the Czech side, as the section 0805 over a length of 16.4 km between Rehlovice and Lovosice is still in the planning phase.
Here the crossing of a protected landscape area in the Bohemian Central Mountains is planned.
According to Czech forecasts from 2001, the traffic volume in 2008 on the border section 0807 of the D 8 motorway will be 22,940 vehicles per day.
German forecasts estimate the volume of traffic on the A17 at the Czech border in 2010 at around 25,000 vehicles per day.
In 2000, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic concluded an agreement to merge the German A 17 motorway and the Czech D 8 motorway at the common state border through the construction of a border bridge.
As both States are involved in the construction of this bridge, this single construction measure was an important aspect of the parallel audits carried out by both Courts of Auditors.
Cooperation between BRH and NKÚ
From mid-2005, the two courts of auditors jointly considered co-operation in the audit of the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway.
Both sides had important reasons for this cooperation:
1.
Germany is partly financing the construction of the border bridge.
Planning and construction are the responsibility of the Czech Road Administration.
There was no possibility for the BRH to examine this construction project itself.
2.
The NKÚ did not have comparative data to assess whether the funds were used sparingly in view of the total construction costs of the bridges and tunnels on the D 8.
3.
The NKÚ also had to examine the effectiveness of the expenditure by examining the essential technical parameters of the bridges and tunnels, which should ensure the same quality of use on both sides of the border.
Following preparatory negotiations, the Presidents of the two Courts of Auditors concluded an agreement on the coordination of audits of the Prague-Dresden motorway on 4 January 2006.
The auditors of both courts met at about six to eight-week intervals in the course of 2006.
In doing so, they dealt with current problems and tasks. They developed a uniform methodology for checking bridge and tunnel prices, exchanged test results on the construction of the border bridge and prepared joint reports.
An essential part of the cooperation has been the ongoing exchange of information.
While the BRH focused mainly on the comparison of the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels as well as the award procedures, the NKÚ mainly developed the methodology for the analysis of bridge and tunnel prices.
In Germany and the Czech Republic, there are differences in the legal basis of financial control and thus in the way in which the two courts of auditors complete their audits.
Therefore, the two authorities each prepared separate national reports on their audit results.
This report takes into account the results of the two parallel audits.
The cooperation will end with the signing of a final communiqué in the first half of 2007.
Construction of the border bridge
In the 2000 treaty, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed to complete the border bridge, if possible, in 2005.
They later postponed the date by mutual consent to the end of 2006.
The RMD acted as the contractor for the construction project.
Germany is co-financing 42.13% of the bridge construction.
Initially, the RMD provided for a pre-stressed concrete structure for the border bridge.
However, RMD and its German partner agreed on the construction of a steel composite structure in 1999.
They justified this decision on the basis of the possible reduction of the number of pillar pairs from seven to five and the associated environmental benefits for the floodplain.
In addition, a comparative calculation of the RMD had identified the steel composite construction as the more cost-effective solution.
However, this was based on a calculation error.
The calculation was based on a length of the new steel composite structure of only 397 m,
In fact, it is 5% longer.
During the award process, the RMD made serious errors,
by inadequately preparing the award documents and describing both evaluation criteria and sub-criteria in an inaccurate manner.
These errors led to subjective and ambiguous assessments by the Valuation Commission and the Director-General of the RMD.
A losing bidder challenged the outcome of the award procedure.
The subsequent investigation by the Czech Antitrust Office delayed the signing of the construction contract for the border bridge.
As a result, the summer construction season following the tender review was lost in 2004 and the total construction time available was shortened.
The contractor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter period of time, resulting in a significant price increase.
Among the measures offered were the double assembly of the superstructures, the change of the shape of the pillars and the construction of an assembly hall.
In addition, the contractor was unable to procure the grade of steel originally intended.
The new grade of steel - whose higher costs of around €4 million were borne by the client alone - made it possible to shorten the construction time intended for corrosion protection and thus the overall construction time.
Compared to the offer price of around €18.3 million net, the total construction costs of the border bridge will increase significantly as a result of the acceleration measures and further supplements.
The shortened construction period alone led to a price increase of around €5.9 million.
The costs, excluding price guidance, currently amount to around €25.9 million net (as of October 2006).
Comparison of prices of bridges and tunnels
Both courts examined the bridge prices on the D 8 and A 17 in order to identify the bridges which were characterised by particularly high prices and to compare the bridge prices on the German and Czech sides.
The study was based on mathematical statistical methods.
The tunnels on the D 8 were compared with similar tunnels on the German motorways A 71, A 38 and A 4, as there were no comparable tunnels on the A 17.
In preparing this part of the examination, a precise definition of the concept of price was important.
For the comparison of the bridge prices, both courts of auditors agreed on detailed specifications, such as: to use the current price paid for the bridge without VAT.
(VAT rates in the Czech Republic and Germany are different and subject to change), not to take into account the costs of special foundation measures, and to use the exchange rate of the European Central Bank of 30.12.2005 for currency conversion (29 CZK = 1 €).
Bridges of various types (reinforced concrete, pre-stressed concrete, steel composite and steel) and of various sizes are available on both the D 8 and the A 17.
In order to ensure the comparability of the tested bridge constructions, the bridges were grouped according to their design.
Within these groups, the analyses also took into account the bridge size.
By far the most frequent were concrete bridges on both sides of the border (20 bridges on the D 8 and 36 bridges on the A 17).
The study focused on this type of bridge, as the size of the sample allowed the application of mathematical statistical methods and improved the reliability of the results.
The study showed that the m ² price of the concrete bridges on the D 8 / A 17 depends on the size of the bridge (length, road surface): the larger the bridge, the lower the price per square metre.
For German bridges, the correlation between price and size is more pronounced than for Czech bridges (see figures below).
Two bridges with significantly higher prices could be found on the A 17 and four on the D 8.
These bridges were determined partly by a method to determine significant deviations within a sample and partly by regression analysis of the correlation between bridge price and size (atypically expensive bridges can be identified on the basis of the distance to the regression curve).
However, the atypically high price of these bridges should only serve as a guide to which bridges to focus on.
In order to draw definitive conclusions, the causes of the high price must be determined on a case-by-case basis.
This could be due, for example, to uneconomic administrative behaviour, but also to environmental protection requirements or other legitimate reasons.
Taking into account the longer average length of Czech concrete bridges compared to German ones (see Table 1), the proven negative correlation between the price of the bridge and the length suggested that Czech concrete bridges are cheaper.
This was also supported by the lower labour costs in the Czech Republic compared to Germany.
The evaluation of the results showed, however, that the price of the concrete bridges on the D 8 is higher than on the A 17.
During joint meetings, two causes of this situation were identified:
1.
In Germany, construction contracts for bridges are mainly awarded separately.
This also makes it possible for medium-sized companies to participate in the award competition.
In the Czech Republic, many bridge constructions are awarded as part of larger contracts for the construction of several kilometres of motorway sections.
Orders of this magnitude cannot be handled by medium-sized enterprises.
2.
The variety of bridge structures built in the Czech Republic is greater than in Germany.
In this context, NKÚ noted that the construction method of bridges is determined long before the start of construction,
as early as the filing of the application for planning approval by the RMD.
At this point in time, it selects a specific bridge construction variant from several alternatives. However, cost-effectiveness plays a minor role in this decision.
Only by means of a thorough analysis of the construction sectors of both countries would a definitive conclusion have been possible with regard to bridge prices in the Czech Republic and Germany. However, this would have gone beyond the scope of this examination.
The border bridge is the most expensive steel composite bridge on the D 8 and A 17.
The prices for the tunnels on the D 8 are about twice as high as in Germany.
However, a comparison of the technical parameters between the tunnels on the D 8 and the tunnels in Germany did not reveal any significant difference.
The significant price differences may be the result of under-developed competition for tunnel construction in the Czech Republic.
However, the small number of tunnels did not allow for generalised conclusions.
Economic efficiency and effectiveness of the Dresden - Prague motorway
The independent Czech Republic was founded in 1993.
In the same year the government adopted the plan for the extension of the motorway network.
The plan was to gradually extend the D 8 from Prague to the state border with Germany.
The section 0805 through the Bohemian Central Mountains before the section 0807 close to the border was to be built.
The Czech Republic finances the D 8 as part of the programme financing.
The programme number 327 220 "Construction of the D 8 motorway Prague - Ústí nad Labem - Czech-German border" defines two objectives:
1.
as a national objective: to improve the connection between Prague and Ústi nad Labem;
2.
as an international destination: the connection between Prague and Berlin as part of the Pan-European Transport Corridor IV BerlinIstanbul.
The programme envisaged the completion of the section leading through the Bohemian Central Mountains in June 2008 and the construction of the cross-border section 0807 in June 2007.
It should be noted that the end of the construction work is not identical to the time of commissioning.
The NKÚ noted that the planning approval decision had already been issued for the construction of the section leading through the Bohemian Central Mountains.
Environmental groups have challenged the decision.
A final verdict is yet to be delivered.
Compared to the timetable provided for in the programme documentation, a delay of several years in the completion of section No.0805 could therefore not be ruled out.
In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed to postpone the completion date of construction phase No.0805 until 2010.
As a result, the construction of the section near the border did not achieve the national objective of improving the connection between Prague and Usti nad Labem.
Between 1999 and 2001, the RMD carried out a cost-effectiveness study of the border section no. 0807 of the D 8 and the section no. 0805 through the Bohemian Central Mountains.
As investment costs, it set aside around €639 million for both sections 0805 and 0807.
Table 2: Results of the profitability study (EIRR = Internal Rate of Interest)

Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8sections in 2007.
Traffic volume in the northern part of the cross-border section 25 000 vehicles per day in 2010.
The economic feasibility study carried out in 2001 was based on the assumption that the section near the border and the section passing through the Bohemian Central Mountains would go under traffic at the same time.
At the time of the test it was obvious that the section through the Bohemian Central Mountains would not be opened at the original date.
This reduces the above-mentioned EIRR values.
As of 31 December 2005, the costs of both sections amounted to €897 million excluding VAT, which is 27.4% higher than the cost-effectiveness analysis for 2001.
There is also a risk that section 0805 will be given a different, more complex route, which would affect the viability of the project.
The economic analysis showed that the construction of both sections of the motorway is economically justified with a daily traffic volume of at least 18 000 vehicles per day in 2010. The forecast for 2008 had predicted 22 940 vehicles per day.
However, a study on diversion routes as an alternative to the missing section through the Bohemian Central Mountains assumes a traffic volume of 12 600 to 13 750 vehicles per day in 2007, when the project will be below the economic viability limit.
Higher traffic volumes on the routes intended to replace the missing section through the Bohemian Central Mountains are highly likely to result in congestion and thus increased external costs, which were not taken into account in the original economic analysis.
The aforementioned reduction in revenue and increase in costs means that the already low EIRR for the construction of the cross-border section of the D 8 will not be achieved.
The construction of the cross-border section of the D 8 is therefore uneconomic.
There were also cost increases in the construction of the A 17, as in the construction of the two above-mentioned sections of the D 8.
In the context of the overall economic evaluation of the 1992 Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan, the Federal Ministry responsible for transport assumed investment costs of around €320 million.
This gave it a benefit / cost ratio of 4.6.
In the meantime, the costs have increased to around €670 million and the benefit / cost ratio has been reduced by more than half.
The BRH had examined the economic viability of the planning and construction of the A 17 motorway independently of the parallel tests with the NKÚ in the years 2003 to 2005.
It found that the authority responsible for the approval requested an unnecessary landscape tunnel for the third section of the A17.
In the course of the audit, the BRH succeeded in convincing the Federal Ministry and the Road Construction Administration of the superfluity of the landscape tunnel.
This has avoided €10 million in construction costs and €150 000 in annual operating costs.
During the examination of the first section of the A17, the BRH found that the construction project was insufficiently prepared.
The following example illustrates this:
During the planning phase, the road construction administration did not record the condition of the rock on the surface of the Dölzschen wall, as it was difficult to access.
It was only when the tunnel drive reached the wall that she made up for it.
It turned out that the rock was more weathered than had been assumed at the tender.
Elaborate measures such as anchoring, injections and rockfall protection nets, worth around €3.3 million, became necessary.
The road construction administration did not only bear the costs for additional services that were already necessary, such as securing the Dölzschen wall, but also for those that would not have been necessary if the construction had been properly prepared.
This includes expenses due to disrupted construction processes (€3.2 million), additional training of the excavation team (€0.5 million) and higher wages and material prices due to the extension of the construction period (€7 million).
This additional expenditure of around €10.7 million is not offset by any lasting added value.
The BRH took this and other measures as an opportunity to call on the Federal Ministry to make better use of the specialist supervision it is responsible for for major road construction measures.
In this context, it should insist on the introduction of quality assurance systems by road construction administrations.
Benefits of cooperation for BRH and NKÚ The cooperation met the expectations of both courts of auditors.
The BRH obtained insights into the planning, award of contracts and implementation of the construction of the border bridge.
Both Courts of Auditors developed a set of data on bridge and tunnel prices which will be useful in future audits.
The NKÚ found that the most important structural parameters for bridges, tunnels and carriageways of the D 8 do not differ from those of the A 17.
The auditors of both courts involved in the co-operation gained valuable experience which will be useful in future audits.
