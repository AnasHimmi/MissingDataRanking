DFB chief Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil's return to the national team.

Despite months of debate over Özil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of 92-time national player Özil.
"I would have been pleased if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed until a certain point that this would be the case, "Grindel said.
De 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July, also justifying it by saying that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostilities during the World Cup.

Return from the Ethnological Museum to Native People in Alaska decided
The Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation (SPK) will return nine objects from the collection of the Ethnological Museum of the State Museums of Berlin to the Chugach Alaska Corporation.
The Board of Trustees today approved a proposal to this effect from the President.
The objects are burial items of Native People from southwest Alaska.
They were among the objects that Johan Adrian Jacobsen, who travelled the American Northwest Coast and Alaska between 1882 and 1884 on behalf of the then Royal Museum of Ethnology (today's Ethnological Museum), brought to Berlin.
Hermann Parzinger, President of the SPK, said:
"At that time, the objects were taken from the graves of their deceased without the consent of the Native People and thus unlawfully, so they do not belong in our museums."
"We will now return you to the Chugach Alaska Corporation, with whom we have been working on reworking our collection since 2015."
The restituted objects will be presented in the Chugach community in the future, among other things in the context of the annual Chugach Spirit Camp, which serves the exchange of knowledge between the generations and the various tribes that are now part of the Chugach.
As part of John Johnson's current visit to Berlin, a Memorandum of Understanding with the Ethnological Museum was also prepared.
The objects are burial items from Chenega Island and the now unknown town of Sanradna in Kachemak Bay.
Among them are two broken masks and a children's cot, as well as a wooden idol.
Masks were usually burned or placed in graves after use, which is why not many masks of the Chugach exist today.
The red color on them refers to the burial context.
The wood idol is probably a shamanic figure who was supposed to protect people from danger and death.
In total, the Ethnological Museum owns just over 200 objects of the Chugach.
The Chugach region in southwest Alaska has been inhabited for several thousand years by people who call themselves Sugpiaq or Alutiiq and were formerly also called Pacific Eskimos.
About 1,000 to 1,500 years ago, athabastic-speaking Indian groups also migrated, today's Dena'ina (formerly called Tanaina).
Today, the Alaskan natives, who call themselves Chugach, live around the Prince William Sound and Cook Inlet.
They live in seven communities: Chenega, Eyak, Nanwalek, Port Graham, Seward, Tatilek and Valdez.
Regular contacts with Europe have existed since the time of Tsar Peter the Great.
In November 2015, a delegation from the Chugach Alaska Corporation visited the Ethnological Museum with the aim of initiating a cooperation for future projects.
The background was, among other things, the interest to create a virtual collection of all Chugach objects worldwide.
Afterwards, the Corporation asked the Ethnological Museum for assistance in repatriating any existing burial items in the region.
The Chugach Alaska Corporation (wwww.chugach-ak.com) is an advocacy group of the Native People of the Chugach Region in Alaska, which has been in existence since 1972.
It is committed, among other things, to preserving the cultural heritage of these groups.
The US government supported the return request by means of a diplomatic note.
In accordance with its basic attitude to dealing with its non-European collections and the exploration of provenances, the SPK carefully examined the context from which the tomb additions, which are located in the Ethnological Museum, come.
In the present case, everything indicates that the objects originate from a burial looting and not from an approved archaeological excavation.
It is clear from Adrian Jacobsen's travel diaries that the graves were opened only for the purpose of retrieving their contents.
There were no official or state permits for this, nor was a consent of the community of origin documented.
Against this background, the decision to return was taken.
Johan Adrian Jacobsen traveled the American northwest coast and Alaska at the end of the 19th century for the Berlin Ethnology Museum.
The director of the museum, Adolf Bastian, had commissioned him to collect as "original" objects as possible, uninfluenced by European culture, for the purpose of building a collection.
Jacobsen brought around 3000 objects from the northwest coast and around 4000 objects from Alaska to Berlin.
His report on the journey is an impressive document of time.
However, it is less characterized by precise ethnographic observation, than as an adventure narrative of a hard-boiled daredevil.

Treysa has to contend with vandalism and treason
The entry into the 36 kilometre long railway cycle path in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and waste.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are scarcely emerging.
Shards, cigarette dumps, rubbish and rubbish, demolished trash bins and now dismantled signs - this is how the entrance with a seating group to the cycle path on the Haaße-Hill in Treysa has been presented for some time.
For the flagship object Bahnradweg in the Rotkäppchenland, a more than unbelievable sight.
The topic has been occupying members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for some time, according to the cycling commissioner of the city Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been raised in the Cycling Advisory Board.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from the laying of the seating group to the regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the imperative of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also brought the issue to the local council.
It is not only the rubbish that drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting place to celebrate on weekends.
Not only is it often loud, the railings are also destroyed: posts are torn out of the earth, dustbins are demolished, signs are knocked over, seating furniture is smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, ADFC member Susanne Klippert says.
But the actions are only the proverbial drop in the ocean.
They are annoyed that the resting place on the cycle path in Treysa is a meeting place for Saufgelage.
"Along the entire cycle path, the focus is clearly here on the Haaße-Hill," confirms the cycling commissioner, who is now also concerned about the new cycling site in Ziegenhain, which will be opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "It may set the threshold much higher to grasp the common good.
However, this would require a police force to pass by in a timely manner.
Basically, Wüstenhagen wants a development of the Haaße-Hügel.
It had to be made more attractive.
One could be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle path so far.
The tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our cycle path is very high quality compared to others in Germany, "said the ADFC members.

Music contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in cooperation.
To offer "D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the Hiltrup district offensive, in the "Music contest for large and small, young and experienced musicians."
A contest "with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family," as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family coexistence with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations competed, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, an Albachtener who has lived in Hiltrup for a long time, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben," three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Lummerland kindergarten and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, said District Mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a novelty.
We have not yet experienced this in other parts of the city.
What did the lyrics see themselves connected to?
In the places, the Hiltruper See and the Marktallee were particularly frequently mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue "Kö von Hiltrup" in his beatable song.
The Kulturbahnhof was also honoured.
Time and again it was about experiencing coexistence in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke animated the short rebuilding breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about their work.
So it was learned from Humberg that he had actually studied chemistry, but now also taught guitar.
Franke knew from the sound technician Stefan Schemmelmann that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic, meanwhile, has placed all sorts of things on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke had said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
For the favourites of the jury, however, there was something special - so that others can also hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record an entire CD with sound technician Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: him with his Hiltrup hit, which particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland pack": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, the children performed again for the final - and even sounded "really good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, simplicity of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund as well as Jan Kaven, Chairman of the Stadtteiloffensive.

The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each page there is a visual shield, in it four cards with keywords, which - the old trick with the red foil - can only be deciphered when you have put them in.
This ensures that the other side cannot read anything by mistake.
On the cards, for example, it reads from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
2. Windows.
3. Dice.
4. Feast."
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
Because it is not the terms that should be guessed here, but codes.
Alternatively, one player per team is the encrypter.
He gets a code card on which perhaps "3.4.2." is written.
In "Decrypto," it is not the terms behind the secret foil that are to be guessed, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "cube," "feast" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team if possible does not; because that wins the game if he succeeds in cracking the code twice.
So the encrypter notes and reads aloud: "throwing" for the cubes, "lots" as a contrast to festival; here, of course, something like "party" would also be possible and "Prague" because he was careful at school and knows the window crash there.
That's how it goes round by round, team by team.
You don't know the terms of the other side - but you can better rhyme them with every hint that the encrypter gives there.
So the rewrites should be as mysterious as possible, but not too twisted, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rule book.
The players probably have to study it quite long and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanatory video at decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But anyone who has started will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as its predecessor and genre primus "Codenames," which also puts an agent ematics on a game of fewer words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And if you are only interested in rates and not winning points, you can easily invent a version for two.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dream ship," Heide Keller became a star.
Now she speaks openly about the fact that the series may have been complicit in her marriage with Hans von Borsody.
Heide Keller (76) made her role of chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "dream ship" famous, but on January 1, 2018 she went off board forever.
The series, which made her a star, could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That may also have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, travelled around the world alone with a suitcase and many colleagues I admired perceived me on an equal footing, "Keller says in an interview with" Bild am Sonntag."
At first, she had always been only "the wife of Hans von Borsody," but that had changed with the "dream ship."
For now, the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it so well."
She thinks it is possible that her husband at the time may have been quite envious, but "like many men, Hans was afraid of conversations about problems and feelings."
Keller had always tried to be "the only right person for Hans von Borsody and he didn't want to get to know my fears, my weaknesses.
In good German, this means that I have adjusted, "she continues.
She had always felt that she was "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, whom I never really was, even if I sometimes seemed cheeky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After an already failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time."
The day before the civil wedding, I sat howling in the wardrobe and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why it never worked out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller imagined love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I have approached love far too naively."

Handball: Association League 1: ASV Send "destroyed on the ground" after last-minute bankruptcy
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball association list ASV Senden, could hardly grasp it: "Such a bitter defeat." His protégés were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - bankruptcy - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.

"Now a damn victory has to come," said Bieletzki, who was fully served.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).

Football: District League: Researchers performance of VfL Wolbeck against SC Altenrheine gives courage
There were moments in this still young season, when Alois Fetsch went hard on the court with his own.
He gave himself a word, the coach of the football district league VfL Wolbeck, first withdrew (internally) to talk about the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
All history.
In the meantime, it is running again around the Brandhoveweg.
The baptismal proof is the 1-1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine, only skinny past the ascent last season.
Yes, I am very satisfied with the performance.
"We made the spaces tight and put pressure on the ball.
That could be seen, "Fetsch praised his guys and looked up each individual after the match to simply say" thank you "for so much opposition against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury to Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - Luca Rehberg came for him - the 4-4-2 went almost seamlessly over to a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes waited for balls in the front line.
Wolbeck had significantly more game shares in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs before his exit (17th), the changed Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
That would almost have been the case when the SCA struck dangerously in front of the Wolbeck box twice in minute 41 in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer - goalkeeper Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his subject.
After the break, the VfL cheekily took full control.
Thewes from 18 metres narrowly failed.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes with a Thewes-entry.
With the change of Miles Geske, Fetsch missed another fresh cell cure on the left side.
When Altenrhein's Chris Naberbäumer felled Robin Westhues in the 70th minute, there was an indirect free-kick for the placeholders 18 metres in front of the guest housing.
The fouled competed himself and demonstrated his dangerousness by standards.
Westhues "thing with the right slip hit the bottom left from the shooter's point of view - 1-0 (71st).
20 minutes still, which should be damn long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather in the penalty area unhappily to his hand in the 80th minute.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79th).
Wolbeck had to survive anxious minutes in the final phase before Geske had the victory hit on the puck from 12 metres in the 87th minute.
Perhaps it would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

After the daunting exit in the league, Manchester United are now also losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.

The scene was emblematic in the 74th minute, in which the recovered Marko Arnautovic shot 3-1 for West Ham, just three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an offside in Mark Nobel's pass, all Manchester's defenders stopped, leaving Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative culmination of a previously inadequate performance for a long time.

Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart unhappily booked Alex Iwobi's entry into his own goal, and just two minutes later Mesut Özil made the decision with his third hit of the season.

About 150 bikers celebrate divine service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service for the motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral concerns of the PS-strong two-cyclists.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place at the Haus Nordhelle on the last Sunday of a month.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Peace Church in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers had gathered there on Sunday to celebrate a far from ordinary service.
As of 10 o'clock, the cars had already lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
At first, the biker early shopping was on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a hearty curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was given during the biker service by the Rev. Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical accompaniment.
"Although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill strikes rather poetic-quiet tones," says the Rev. Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.

1:4 against Frankfurt: Hanover with fourth season bankruptcy: "Shocked situation"
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hanover 96 around him and gave them courage.
However, there was not much positive to see before at the 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shameful situation, but you have to get out there as a team," said 96 football professional Pirmin Schwegler, pushing back: "That's disappointing, of course, because you always take a lot of action."
The further victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86th) hit, are at the bottom with two points and are a candidate for descent in their current constitution.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt, on the other hand, celebrated its first home victory of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored the goals in front of 46,300 spectators for the DFB Cup winner, who advanced to the midfield of the table with seven points after the successful dress rehearsal for the Europa League game against Lazio Rome.
Croatia's vice-world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action by Hesse on his starting debut and never got a grip on Hanover's defence.
The striker, who has long been battered after the World Cup, showed with his pace and assertiveness why he is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, who was borrowed from Liverpool FC, was also in the initial formation of the Frankfurt players for the first time, which began vividly.
A header ball from Lucas Torró (17th) falsified on the goal net brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96 defence around Brazilian Felipe, who replaced Kevin Wimmer (back), who had failed at short notice.
The leadership for the landlords was almost inevitable and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a deflected corner, Haller extended his head in front of the goal, where Ndicka only needed to hold his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga hit for the defender, who came from French runner-up AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt dropped before the break.
This time, Haller matched his Storm partner Rebic, who skillfully tanked through and left 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser with no chance.
At half-time, Hanover coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak performance of his eleven and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony now played a little more courageous forward, but inflammatory ideas remained missing until just before the end, when the connection hit was still successful.
The Hesse were much more efficient.
After less than an hour, Rebic started a solo and then put across De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was only showmanship for the Frankfurt against overstretched guests, and Jovic also hit a minute before the end.
The summer itself was also unusually wet.

In 2016, the excavators moved on to demolish the house.

The cosiness and functionality were well combined, Kreutmayer said.
He added: "The property in this situation is a real stroke of luck because it can no longer be purchased in today's situation."
In total, the new dormitory in Münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities on almost 1500 square metres, which are divided into three residential groups.

Colour powder and eggs: riots in Barcelona ahead of Catalonia anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia.
But there are riots before that.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017, clashes between separatists and the police took place in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence supporters with paint powder, among other things, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3,000 officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wanted to use a rally to honour their colleagues who were deployed in the polling stations last year in the referendum, which was classified as illegal.
Violence had also taken place at the time in an attempt to prevent citizens from voting.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central state security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
However, some of the 6,000 or so separatists then forcibly tried to break through the police chain, throwing the officers with paint bags and eggs, among other things.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured, it said, citing the authorities.

Lubricants with local political message: No successful advertising for skate facility
In Lengerich, unknown people have campaigned in a hardly conducive way for the construction of a skate facility.
There are corresponding lubricants in several places, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration at the request of WN.
In at least one case, a criminal complaint has been filed with the police for damage to property.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark for Lengerich!" are displayed on signs at the Gempt-Halle and the Old Town Hall, among others.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that a corresponding lettering on the advertising sign at the staircase to the Gempt bistro had already been discovered after the professional election fair on 19 September.
Since the short message had apparently been left "only" with an edding at the time, it could have been removed without any problems.
"A few days later, however, it was back, this time sprayed up," Rottmann said.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
This case in particular gets a special touch by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the table.
If the skate facility is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already commitments, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department of school, sport and culture, without naming names.
It is quite possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the smeared board.

Public procurement of works and prevention of corruption
Joint report by the Supreme Supervisory Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel audits
Introduction and overview
The award of services by contracting authorities is of great importance both to the state and to the economy.
The task of the State is to use public funds in the most economical and economical way possible and to ensure fair and regulated competition.
In the European Union (EU), the award of services by contracting authorities is an important part of the creation of a single economic area.
In order to ensure that competition is largely unrestricted across borders, contracting authorities must comply with EU requirements when awarding contracts above certain value limits (thresholds).
To this end, EU member states must transpose and apply EU public procurement law into national law.
This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.
Under the EU thresholds, it is up to individual countries to regulate the award of public contracts themselves.
The award of services is also an area at risk of corruption.
In view of the generally high potential for damage, the contracting authorities must therefore take appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and inadmissible benefits when awarding their contracts.
In January 2011, the Supreme Supervisory Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed to carry out parallel audits both for the award of construction services throughout the EU and for the prevention of corruption.
The audits focused on the application of EU public procurement law transposed into national rules, as well as on the prevention of corruption in the award of construction services in construction, road construction and transport infrastructure.
Procurement below the EU thresholds has also been included in the consideration with a view to preventing corruption.
The audit results of both audit bodies are summarised in the present Joint Report.
The report will also be addressed to international institutions, such as the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).
Examination areas and audited bodies The evaluations of the Federal Court of Auditors on the listed topics are mainly based on cross-sectional tests carried out in 2011 / 2012 at the construction administrations responsible for the road and construction construction of the federal government in Germany.
In doing so, he examined, for example, the construction of motorways and large construction projects.
In addition, the Federal Court of Auditors drew on results from previous investigations.
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic based its evaluations on audit findings from 2008 to 2011, which included construction measures in road construction, rail infrastructure construction, water construction, construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.) as well as other construction areas in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the award of the public contracts of the federal government is carried out predominantly by the construction administrations of the federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the public works administration is centrally responsible for the procurement of transport infrastructure.
In construction, the awards are carried out decentrally by those bodies that use state budget resources.
In both countries, freelancers will also be involved in parts of the procurement procedures.
When comparing the evaluations, differences in public procurement law and in the market structure for construction services in both countries must be taken into account.
Building up public procurement law in both countries
In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide procurement procedures is laid down in laws and regulations.
Procurement procedures limited to the national sphere are governed by budgetary law and the administrative rules based on it.
In addition, for both EU-wide and national contracts, many complementary individual rules are laid down by internal administrative rules,
such as the so-called "procurement books" of the federal government, in which the legal requirements are supplemented or further formulated in accordance with the case law of public procurement law.
In the Czech Republic, the award procedure is governed exclusively by the Public Procurement Act and other legal provisions, which apply both above and below the EU thresholds.
The public procurement law was significantly amended in 2012.
The new rules increased transparency in the management of public funds, allowed for increased competition and limited the scope for corruption in the award procedure.
Broad outlines of public procurement law in both countries
In both countries, the open procedure, the non-open procedure and the negotiation procedure have to be applied to EU-wide contracts.
In Germany, measures below the EU threshold are subject to national types of procurement (public tendering, limited tendering, freelance procurement), but these are largely in line with the above-mentioned EU-wide types of procurement.
Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of the primacy of the open procedure (for contracts to be carried out throughout the EU) and the public tender procedure (for national contracts).
In the open procedure and in the public call for tenders, any interested company can make an offer.
Another essential feature of German public procurement law is the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises.
For this purpose, the main purpose is to divide an overall construction measure into specialist and partial persons.
The individual award of these lots is intended to enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.
Both of the aforementioned features of German public procurement law are proven instruments for achieving economic results.
More than 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees are active in Germany.
In the Czech Republic, EU-wide procurement procedures must also be applied to construction projects below the EU threshold.
One exception is the simplified procedure, which allows a less stringent procedure to be applied below the thresholds and under certain conditions.
In line with EU law, Czech public procurement rules provide for contracts to be concluded if competition is guaranteed and a favourable price is achieved.
The current legal provisions in the Czech Republic allow the contracting authorities to choose between open and non-open procedures.
There are more than 85,000 construction companies in the Czech Republic, of which about 1,900 have 20 or more employees.
Construction volume of contracting authorities and shares of the types of contracts in both countries
In Germany, the total construction volume in 2011 amounted to 307 billion euros.
Of this, €45.5 billion was spent on public construction (15%), which includes, in addition to federal construction, in particular, the construction measures of the federal states and municipalities.
The construction volume of the federal government in construction and long-distance road construction (excluding rail infrastructure construction and water construction) amounted to 8.5 billion euros.
The volume of contracts for construction services in the construction and long-distance road construction of the federal government was distributed among the types of contracts in 2011 as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public tenders, 12.7% non-open procedures and limited tenders, and 6.6% negotiation procedures and freelance contracts.
Of these, 33.2% were Europe-wide contracts.
The volume of public works projects in the Czech Republic amounted to €4.7 billion in 2011, representing about 25% of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.
In 2009, the volume was EUR 7.8 billion, which corresponded to 37% of the total construction volume.
Breakdown by type of award for 2011:65.1% open procedures 14.3% non-public procedures 9.5% negotiated procedures 8.4% simplified procedures for contract volume below the threshold 2.7% other procedures
The data relate to all public contracts for supplies, services and works awarded by public contracting authorities in 2011.
The above data show that the parallel audits of both countries focus on a significant proportion of public contracts, that the prevention of corruption to be observed in all contracts is of great financial importance and that the open procedure and public tendering are of paramount importance in the award of contracts.
Summary of the results of the parallel tests
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have carried out parallel audits in their countries on the award of construction services throughout the EU and on the prevention of corruption.
In this context, the working groups of both Court of Auditors compared the relevant legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany, as well as the results of their parallel audits carried out, in particular in the areas of construction and road construction.
In essence, they found that:
The EU Directives on the award of works by contracting authorities have been transposed into national law in both the Czech Republic and Germany (Nos 1 and 3.1).
In addition to the EU requirements, the prevention of corruption is also served by the procurement rules of both countries, which differ in part in their priorities and in their detail (No. 3.2).
In both countries, an essential requirement for the award documents is that they contain all the information necessary for the proper preparation of a bid.
The performance descriptions must be neutral and must not be subject to competitive advertising restrictions.
In Germany, the award documents have largely complied with these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, it is still a problem to determine the object of the contract sufficiently.
In Germany, construction services must be divided into lots as far as possible in order to promote competition.
According to the findings of the BRH, this requirement has been largely implemented in Germany.
In its audits, the NKÚ found, in particular in the field of road construction, that the award of large services without lots or with very large lots could affect competition and lead to a restriction to only a few large companies.
Restrictions in market potential can lead to significant cost increases and pose a risk of price or other collusion.
In accordance with the provisions of both countries, the contracting authorities may, under certain conditions, in principle agree with the companies already contracted additional or modified services which prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (No. 4.1).
The respective benchmarks for determining the type of award have been largely followed in both countries.
Under the Czech Republic's rules, contracting authorities are free to choose between open and non-open procedures.
In Germany, on the other hand, the legal and budgetary priority of the open procedure applies to EU-wide contracts or to the public tender procedure, which corresponds to the open procedure in the case of national contracts.
As a result, more companies can make offers.
This reduces the risk of corruption, makes price fixing between bidders more difficult and leads to the most economical results.
In the case of construction projects whose estimated total contract values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited construction administrations awarded the construction services in principle throughout Europe.
The correct estimate of the expected value of the contract is an essential basis for choosing the right type of award.
In Germany, cost databases are used for the cost assessment of public buildings, in particular in the construction sector,
based on the evaluations of completed construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the field of road construction, but it is not yet an effective instrument (No. 4.2).
In the case of works to be awarded throughout Europe, preliminary information and announcements must be published, in order to strengthen competition by enabling interested companies to anticipate the planned contracts at an early stage.
The audited building administrations usually complied with this requirement.
In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or lack of controls may have affected competition (No. 4.3).
The selection of candidates for participation in non-public procurement procedures is particularly susceptible to manipulation.
Under EU law, the number of applicants invited must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not discriminate and must be announced beforehand.
In addition to the EU requirements, the contracting authorities in both countries should switch as often as possible among the companies to be requested when selecting candidates.
In order to counter the risk of manipulation, there are sometimes very detailed requirements in Germany.
In some cases, the audited administrations did not take these requirements into account.
In the Czech Republic, decisions on the selection of candidates were not always comprehensible (No. 4.4).
In both countries, in the interests of equal competition, it is necessary to ensure that companies interested in bidding receive the same information during the bidding phase.
As far as possible, contact between these companies and with freelancers who have been involved in the preparation of the service description must be avoided in order to avoid anti-competitive agreements.
The relevant regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.
However, some of the audited building administrations in Germany did not comply with these requirements (No. 4.5).
In opening up bids, the principle of multi-eye and transparency must be observed in both countries in particular.
The requirements for the labelling, documentation, custody and secrecy of the offers are intended to limit the scope for manipulation and are particularly detailed in Germany.
The audits in both countries showed only a few complaints (No. 4.6).
Examination and evaluation of the offers are defined in both countries by requirements for the organisation of construction and processes.
The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been consistently observed by the audited contracting authorities.
For example, contracting authorities handed over offers for examination to third parties without looking through the offers beforehand and adequately documenting abnormalities.
As a result, the offers were not sufficiently protected against subsequent manipulation (No. 4.7).
At the end of the EU-wide procurement procedures, the parties to the competition will be informed of the proposed contract prior to the award of the contract.
This possibility of legal protection also has a preventive function against corrupt behaviour.
The Czech Republic also provides for the possibility of judicial review for non-EU-wide procurement procedures.
Only in a few cases did the contracting authorities fail to comply with the prescribed deadlines or deviate from the offer of the bidders in terms of content (No. 4.8).
The documentation of the award procedures was not always complete or comprehensible by the audited building administrations in both countries.
In this respect, the EU-wide transparency requirement was not sufficiently implemented in the award notices of some procedures.
Some of the identified shortcomings also reduced the corruption-prevention function of the documentation.
The contracting authorities of both countries largely complied with their reporting and reporting obligations (No. 4.9).
Fundamentals of EU public procurement law and corruption prevention
EU public procurement law
In order to ensure unrestricted competition within the European Union with the free movement of services and goods, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, among other things, the Procurement Coordination Directives and the Remedies Directives, which had to be transposed into national law by the 8 Member States.
The general tendering principles of the European Union are, in particular, the requirement for competition, the requirement for equal treatment or the prohibition of discrimination and the requirement for transparency.
In order to achieve these objectives, the Procurement Coordination Directive sets out specific rules for works to be awarded throughout the EU for construction projects.
For this purpose, their expected order amounts must reach or exceed a volume of currently 5,000,000 euros.
The rules concern in particular the content of the award documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, the adherence to deadlines, inter alia for the receipt of tenders, the documentation of the award procedure, the requirements that can be imposed on the qualifications of applicants and the Remedies Directive provides the basis for the legal protection of applicants and tenderers.
In the event of possible infringements of public procurement law, companies concerned may have the decisions of the contracting authorities reviewed in review procedures.
Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the directives of the European Union into national law.
Prevention of corruption
Importance of the prevention of corruption
In both countries there is no legal definition of the concept of corruption.
In general, corruption is the abuse of a position of trust for the private benefit,
which is usually initiated by the beneficiaries of these decisions.
Corruption can hinder competition and cause significant economic damage.
It is estimated that the global cost of corruption is 5% of world economic output.
For the European Union, the amount of these costs is estimated at 1%.
In the case of contracting authorities, restrictive agreements or unfair practices can jeopardise confidence in the integrity and functioning of the administration.
Preventing corruption is therefore one of the fundamental tasks of public contracting authorities.
In doing so, they will have to review the organisation of their administrations in areas that are particularly vulnerable to corruption, in order to take appropriate safeguards against corruption.
Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly reduce the vulnerability of decision-making processes to corrupt abuse.
In principle, the award of public works is considered to be a particularly corruption-prone area of work.
Measures to prevent corruption
In Germany, corruption - in particular bribery and bribery, as well as the acceptance and approval of benefits - is prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
In order to prevent corruption, the Federal Government has adopted a Directive and Recommendations on the Prevention of Corruption 12 in the Federal Administration.
In addition, further anti-corruption requirements have been incorporated into the public procurement rules.
In 2011, for example, the Federal Ministry responsible for public procurement in the area of federal highways introduced an electronically supported control system,
with the award data, such as the estimated costs and the order amounts, as well as information on the freelancers involved, are collected across the board and evaluated for abnormalities.
In the Czech Republic, corruption is also prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
The statutory imperatives of transparency and equal treatment of bidders, as well as the prohibition of any discrimination, are the most important foundations of the prevention of corruption.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech government has identified anti-corruption measures in a strategy paper on anti-corruption for the years 2011 to 2012 and updated them for the years 2013 to 2014.
Some of the measures recommended in it have already been transposed into national public procurement law and related administrative provisions 14.
The main provisions of the new legislation are the lowering of the thresholds for smaller contracts, the obligation to notify contracts in advance by the contracting authority, including the reasons for tendering, the prohibition of restricting the number of bidders in non-open procedures and thus the elimination of the possibility of selecting bidders through batch procedures, the introduction of the obligation to publish the contract documents and all the annexes, the introduction of the obligation to publish the actual price and the list of subcontractors.
Examination results on the different stages of the award procedure
Procurement documents
Procurement Documents The award documents must contain all the information that bidders need to make an appropriate bid.
In particular, the award documents must make it possible to calculate correctly.
In doing so, bidders must not be entrusted with risks that cannot be calculated for them.
The contract documents consist in particular of the service description and the contract conditions.
In addition, they contain the requirements for proving the qualification (suitability) of the bidders as well as the criteria governing the selection of the most economical offer.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
The requirements of EU law for the award documents are based in particular on the technical specifications.
These must be equally accessible to all bidders and should limit competition as little as possible.
In principle, the performance description must be product-neutral.
For this reason, information on products or manufacturers as part of the service description is only permissible under strict conditions.
Avoiding anti-competitive requirements in procurement documents is also a fundamental principle of the prevention of corruption.
In addition, ambiguous or incorrect information in the award documents must be avoided, as it opens up scope for speculation in the preparation of tenders and for manipulation of their valuation.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules In both countries, the EU legal requirements on technical specifications have been transposed into national law.
In principle, the services are to be advertised product-neutral without factory specifications.
In the performance descriptions, the individual services must as a rule be broken down in detail into performance units with respective quantities.
The prices are to be agreed on the basis of performance units (e.g. Euro per m ² or per piece).
Only in exceptional cases can services be defined by functional targets.
The performance descriptions must in any case be complete and unambiguous.
They must contain precise quantities and must not include services for which it is not clear whether they are needed.
Compensation by lump sum or by time is to be avoided as far as possible.
The purpose of these provisions is to prevent speculation and manipulation based on indefinite requirements in the award documents.
The service descriptions must enable bidders to prepare their offers safely and without extensive preparatory work.
The call for tenders will not be made public until the award documents have been finalised.
Different rules
There is no obligation to tender for construction services in lots in the Czech Republic.
If it is possible according to the type of service to be commissioned, the public contracting authorities can divide construction services into several lots.
In Germany, construction services must in principle be divided into lots, separated by quantity (partial) and / or by type or specialist areas (skilled persons).
The aim is to enable small and medium-sized enterprises to compete, to increase the number of potential suppliers and to make price fixing more difficult.
This type of award is considered to be the most economical as a rule.
In the Czech Republic, evaluation criteria must be indicated in the award documents for both EU-wide and national procedures.
The aim is to ensure that applicants are fully and definitively aware of the criteria according to which their offers are to be evaluated.
In Germany, the indication of evaluation criteria in EU-wide notices, but at the latest in the award documents, is only required in EU-wide procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, the evaluation criteria must only be set out in an internal procurement notice.
In Germany, contract documents drawn up by commissioned freelancers may not contain any references to these offices or involved planners or reviewers at the civil engineering and some road construction administrations.
The aim is to prevent individual companies from obtaining additional information or other undue competitive advantages without the knowledge of the client about the contact with these freelancers.
This is also the reason why freelancers are not allowed to send award documents or interpret planning documents for inspection.
The contact person of the companies is the client alone.
There is currently no regulation on this in the Czech Republic.
Additional or modified services that prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (supplements) are almost always incurred in the case of large construction projects.
In both countries, the legal provisions allow, to a certain extent, the award of supplements to the already contracted company without the need for a public procurement procedure.
According to the EU requirements and the German regulations, the remuneration of supplementary services may not exceed half of the main order.
In addition, the additional services must not be separated from the main order without significant disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.
In the Czech Republic, there is a narrower limit of 20% for an award without a public notice.
However, this may increase the risk of delayed completion of the construction project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the construction work already under way.
If supplementary services are also transferred to the already contracted company, according to the regulations in Germany, an arbitrary price increase for these services by the contractor is in principle not possible.
The calculation of the remuneration for the additional services must be based on the agreed prices and on the basis of the price determination of the order already awarded.
In addition to supplementary services, there may also be a reduction in the scope of services.
In the Czech Republic, small quantities cannot be offset with additional supplementary services.
Key audit results
BHR
Technical specifications and product-neutral tender
In individual cases, the service descriptions contained references to national technical authorisations or standards that had already been replaced by Europe-wide standards.
Some performance descriptions also included product-related requirements - for example, for graffiti protection, joint tapes or noise protection plates - without this being necessary.
In some cases, performance requirements were described so accurately that only one product was eligible.
Performance directories subdivided by partial services
In none of the cases examined, the BRH has found breaches of the bid to tender services in principle in a list of services subdivided according to partial services.
Completeness of performance descriptions
In the vast majority of cases, the award documents had been finalised before the start of the tenders.
In some cases, the award documents had to be corrected during the tender phase, as some positions or deadlines had changed.
In some cases, the performance directories contained positions where it was not clear whether they were needed.
In fact, almost half of a list of services for demolition work consisted of such needs.
Loses and evaluation criteria
In the case of many awards, the prescribed justification was missing as to why the services, which were mostly advertised according to the skilled, were not further divided into partial ones.
There were no objections to the indication of the criteria to be used in the evaluation of the offers.
References to freelancers
A small part of the performance descriptions contained references to the freelancers involved.
Their names were partly on the cover sheets or in attached plans or opinions.
In one case, the contracting authority even explicitly asked the applicants to contact the architect "on issues of tendering."
In the construction sector in particular, the contracting authorities attributed the reported complaints mainly to the omissions of the freelancers commissioned to draw up the performance descriptions.
The construction services pointed out the lack of capacity in order to be able to adequately control the performance descriptions.
NKÚ
Technical specifications and product-neutral call for tenders In the public procurement for the construction of a residential building with 12 residential units, a supplier and a specific product brand were specified in the service description.
The contracting authority did not allow the use of comparable products without justifying this.
In the construction of several university buildings, suppliers and products were also specified in the call for tenders.
Performance descriptions with performance units
In the case of construction projects in some industrial areas, the contracting authority did not clearly specify the scope and nature of the required services in the performance descriptions.
As performance units, it only stated the converted space of the individual buildings in cubic meters.
Completeness of performance descriptions
For the construction of a motorway bypass, the performance descriptions were changed four times in the period August to September 2009 under a non-open procedure,
as the scope of services had increased considerably and the technical requirements had changed.
Tendering documents for social buildings contained inaccurate location information, inadequate preliminary structural examinations and incomplete design drawings, which meant that additional services had to be commissioned.
During the construction of a large library building, the performance description of the interior did not contain any requirements for product quality.
As a result of these missing requirements, some subcontractors installed overpriced and unreasonably high quality equipment.
Loses and aptitude criteria
In the Czech Republic, the division of construction measures into partial or the award of partial contracts is not mandatory.
An examination of the three large sections of the construction of a motorway ring showed that if selected parts were awarded separately, savings of up to 31.6 million euros would have been possible with a total cost of 620.3 million euros.
For example, for six different buildings that were the subject of a single contract alone, 2.5 million euros (25%) could have been saved if they were awarded separately.
If the construction of 20 bridges had been awarded separately, savings of 11.5 million euros (25%) would have been possible compared to a total allocation.
In the award of construction services in road construction, the central contracting authority set very extensive reference requirements as aptitude criteria.
In the construction of part of a motorway, the contracting authority required the bidders, in an open procedure, to prove, among other things, at least three road construction projects carried out, worth 28 million euros each from the last five years.
In the Czech Republic, a maximum of nine suppliers met these requirements.
The public procurement of another section of a motorway included six separate construction projects, for which the contracting authority had set an annual construction volume of at least €480 million over the last three years as an aptitude criterion for the companies.
Two-thirds of the funds allocated to road construction projects in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. €2.5 billion out of a total of €3.7 billion) were contracted by a total of five companies that carried out the contracts alone or as a working group.
In 46 procurement procedures with a contract volume of EUR 528 million, only two or even one bidder submitted an offer.
The NKÚ showed that a narrowing of the market potential can lead to significant cost increases.
Additional benefits
In the case of the construction of a motorway bypass, the contracting authority did not apply any of the statutory procedures for the award of additional services in two cases and did not enter into written contracts for the additional services.
Due to unclear quantity and quality requirements, supplements were incurred in the first case of up to 63.7 million euros (net) and in the second case up to 165.4 million euros (net), which increased the respective order volume by 21% and 91% respectively.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In the case of several higher education buildings, some services were not listed in the award documents, although their necessity was already known when the award was awarded.
Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the limit set by national public procurement law of 20% of the original contract value, the contracting authority conducted negotiations with the contracted companies without notifying them.
In the case of the construction of a large court building, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional construction services in negotiation procedures without a call for tenders.
During the construction period, the contracting authority extended the scope of the work by 2 million euros.
The uniform prices for the additional construction services awarded without competition were significantly higher than comparable services provided by the same company.
Other findings
On the basis of a sampling of construction projects, the NKÚ found that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway kilometre in the Czech Republic is up to 14.6 million euros.
In Deuschland, on the other hand, according to an evaluation of long-term data from the Federal Ministry of Construction, the average cost of a four-lane motorway kilometre is up to 10.4 million euros.
This comparison suggests that motorway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.
Summary findings
The basic rules on procurement documents are broadly in line in both countries and take into account EU requirements.
They serve both comprehensive and fair competition and the prevention of corruption.
For example, the requirement for sufficient determination of the performance descriptions should enable bidders to calculate and draw up their offers in an appropriate manner,
protect the client from additional services to be agreed upon afterwards and also reduce speculative leeway.
In Germany, the common basic requirements on procurement documents are supplemented by regulations aimed at further reducing restrictions on competition and the possibility of manipulation.
There are no such requirements in the Czech Republic, but transparency will be increased by the publication of the evaluation criteria in non-EU-wide procurement procedures.
The requirements for the description of services have been largely met in both countries.
In some cases, however, derogations have had to be objected to, which may also have led to restrictions on competition.
The existing requirement for the formation of lots in Germany promotes competition and leads to economic results.
In the Czech Republic, according to the audit findings of the NKÚ, the award of extensive services without lots or with very large lots may result in restrictions on the range of suppliers to only a few large companies.
The extensive reference requirements for road construction in the Czech Republic have meant that public contracts are awarded only to a narrow circle of suppliers and that small and medium-sized enterprises are not allowed to compete.
In addition, a limited number of competitors often leads to higher prices and increases the risk of price or other collusion.
Regulatory approaches differ in both countries when it comes to the award and remuneration of additional or modified services.
According to the EU and German rules, supplementary services with a value of up to half of the main contract can be awarded under certain conditions without a public notice procedure.
In the Czech Republic, there is a narrower limit of 20% up to which additional services can be awarded to the original contractor in the negotiation procedure without notice.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This limit is often exceeded,
because the scope of services for public contracts is often insufficiently determined.
If the excess exceeds 20%, the additional services will have to be advertised with a public notice.
By dividing services into lots, restrictions on competition and the resulting adverse consequences can be avoided.
Defining the type of award and taking into account the EU threshold
By determining the type of award, the contracting authority determines the size of the number of companies participating in the competition.
It can leave the circle of potential candidates and bidders largely unrestricted, for example by choosing an open procedure, or by specifying non-public procurement procedures.
In the case of construction projects where a threshold set by the EU is reached or exceeded, Europe-wide procurement procedures must be applied.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
In choosing the type of award, the contracting authority must take into account in particular the requirements of European law on competition and transparency.
If the estimated total contract value of the construction services of a project is at or above the EU threshold of currently 5,000,000 euros, the construction services must in principle be awarded throughout Europe according to open or non-open procedures.
In exceptional cases, negotiation procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.
In the case of construction projects that reach or exceed the EU threshold, the contracting authority may, to a limited extent, derogate from the principle of Europe-wide procurement and award works in national procurement procedures, provided that the estimated contract value of the respective lot is less than €1,000,000 and that the sum of these lots does not exceed 20% of the estimated total contract value of all works contracts.
A single construction project must not be divided into individual measures without compelling reason or deliberately estimated at too low cost values in order to deprive it of the obligation to award construction services throughout Europe in principle.
As restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of type of award is of great importance in the prevention of corruption.
The detailed justification of the type of award chosen, as well as the examination of the obligation to apply EU public procurement rules, are important elements of the documentation of the award procedure.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed EU rules on procurement procedures and the threshold into national law.
Different rules
The Czech Republic has also transferred the principle of equal status of open and non-open procedures contained in the EU Directive to its construction contracts, which are not subject to EU requirements.
There is freedom of choice between the open and the non-open procedure, without the decision being doctored or justified, but other procedures are only possible under certain conditions defined by law.
In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure or - in the case of national contracts - the public tender procedure takes precedence in principle, as laid down by budgetary and public procurement law as well as by the directives on the prevention of corruption.
Other types of award - as well as the non-open procedure or the limited call for tenders - are only possible in exceptional cases, which are finally regulated in public procurement law.
The existence of an exceptional case must be comprehensively justified and documented.
The principle of the primacy of the open procedure or the public call for tenders is intended to ensure that competition is as unrestricted as possible, to exclude the possibility of manipulation by fixing certain bidders and to make possible price fixing between bidders more difficult.
The principle of public tendering is a central element of the prevention of corruption in Germany.
The correct estimate of the expected value of the contract is an essential basis for choosing the right type of award.
The construction services in Germany can use planning and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations to determine the expected costs in the area of public construction.
These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects, including cost parameters for building categories, units of use, components or individual construction services.
On the basis of such cost indicators, the expected order value of a planned advance or a construction performance to be awarded can be determined.
In Germany, some construction administrations only have corresponding cost databases for road construction.
However, a nationwide introduction for all road construction administrations is planned.
Contracting authorities in the Czech Republic cannot rely on central databases or average price investigations of comparable construction measures to determine the projected costs of construction services.
On the contrary, in most cases, the cost assessments are based on estimates by the financing body or are based on the amount of funds made available to the construction service.
Measures to standardise cost assessment procedures are still in their infancy.
As part of the anti-corruption plan for 2011 - 2012, the relevant ministries were commissioned to create a database for standardised building materials and materials.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The purpose of this database is to collect information on material expenditure and construction and extension works, as well as other cost-relevant data, in order to enable cost investigations and regulations of uniform prices.
In order to better control costs, the Czech Ministry of Transport has also published a data collection for construction projects,
which will serve as a benchmark for price fixing in the financing plan and is currently being updated.
Main audit results BRH
Election of the award procedure
The audited contractors wrote out the construction services to a large extent in the open procedure or in public tender and thus complied with the budgetary and public procurement requirements.
In 2011, 59.5% of the federal construction services in the construction sector were advertised to the public or in an open procedure.
In road construction, this figure was 94.8%.
The choice of non-public contracts lacked some detailed justifications as to why the contracting authorities had to deviate from the principle of open procedure or public tendering.
In a cross-sectional investigation, the BRH found, on the basis of more than 16,000 procurement procedures, that non-public tenders have significant disadvantages in terms of competition compared to open procedures and public tenders and increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.
In the construction sector, more than twice as many offers were submitted in public tenders as in limited tenders and almost three times as many offers as in the case of freelancers.
The investigation also showed that bidding prices for limited tenders and freelancers were, on average, 6% and 10% higher than for public tenders.
Parallel investigations by the Federal Ministry of Building and a State Court of Auditors confirmed the economic differences between public and non-public types of procurement.
As a result of its studies on profitability, the Federal Ministry of Building even found twice as many differences between public and non-public procurement procedures.
Taking into account the EU threshold
In the case of the construction projects for which they had identified an estimated total order amount of more than 5,000,000 euros, the audited contracting authorities usually drew up procurement plans in which they determined the construction services to be awarded in accordance with EU wide and national procurement procedures.
According to the procurement plans, this meant that more than 80% of construction services were to be awarded across the EU.
It was not possible to circumvent the obligation to award contracts across the EU through overly low cost estimates.
However, partly as a result of incorrect calculations, the minimum share of EU procurement procedures actually fell short.
During the construction process, some contracting authorities unduly changed the definitions of their procurement plans.
They did not justify these changes and did not demonstrate that the minimum share of EU-wide procurement procedures was still respected.
For most of the construction measures audited, the share of EU-wide contracts according to the billing results was usually lower than envisaged under the procurement plan.
In some cases, in the case of construction projects above the EU threshold, the contracting authorities failed to comply with the requirement to tender all €1,000,000 or more comprehensive individuals in EU-wide procedures,
and instead chose national procedures.
NKÚ
Choosing the type of award
In several major construction measures, such as the construction of some sections of the motorway, construction projects in the context of a major sports event and housing projects, the contracting authorities divided construction services into several partial contracts, although these services were similar or comparable.
As a result of these breakdowns, the individual benefits were no longer above the threshold and were subsequently awarded in simplified procedures or even in disregard of legal requirements.
Calculation methods for the estimated order value
In the field of road construction, the existing price databases for this area were an inadequate instrument for determining the expected order values.
The data was based on recently completed construction projects, but there were indications of a lack of profitability, unnecessary additional performance costs or excessive profits of the contracted companies.
For three sections of a motorway ring, the actual prices were about 37% lower than the expected order values determined by the database.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Transport revised the databases in order to be able to take into account not only the offer prices of recent years, but also comparable market prices and price increase indices in the construction sector.
In construction, the expected order values were based on cost values estimated by the project architects or on estimates by the investors.
The actual order values deviated greatly from the estimated values.
The estimated price for the conversion or expansion of a large library was twice as high as the later agreed order value, but eight supplements in the course of the construction led to an increase in costs of 2.1 million euros or 27%.
Similarly, the actual value of the contract for the construction of a library depot was 33% lower than the estimated price, with cost increases during the construction phase.
In other cases, the offer prices exceeded the estimated values and increased during construction.
For the construction of a large library, the estimated price was exceeded by 16 million euros or 22%; for the construction of a judicial building, the cost increased disproportionately at 139%, as the usable area had only expanded by 12%.
Summary findings
Both countries have transposed into national law the EU rules on setting the type of award and taking into account the EU threshold, which is why the respective rules are largely in line.
However, the primacy of the open procedure or public call for tenders in Germany goes beyond the EU requirements and the rules in force in the Czech Republic.
Compared to non-public procurement procedures, more companies have the opportunity to compete in public procedures or public tenders.
Public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of tenders and to the most economical results.
The risk of corruption will be significantly improved by not restricting the field of candidates by setting the client susceptible to manipulation and by making price fixing between bidders more difficult.
The investigations have confirmed the merits of the primacy of the open procedure or of the public tender in Germany.
Czech legislation allows contracting authorities to award contracts in an open or non-open procedure.
According to the latest changes in public procurement law, the number of bidders may no longer be limited in previous competition procedures.
This means that the non-open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.
In Germany, the contracting authorities have largely complied with the requirements on the primacy of the open procedure or the public tender. In the Czech Republic, some services have been allocated inadmissibly in order to circumvent the requirements on the choice of the type of award.
When taking into account the EU threshold, errors had to be found in Germany, which led to a reduction in the minimum proportion of benefits advertised throughout the EU.
In the Czech Republic, there is still no satisfactory solution to accurately determine the projected costs of construction services and construction projects.
Building administrations should, where appropriate, carry out further checks to ensure that the requirements for selecting the type of award and the scope of services to be tendered throughout the EU are complied with, or that the conditions are created for appropriate cost investigations.
Preliminary information and notice
In the case of construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe, the public builder must inform interested companies of the planned contracts in advance of the call for tenders.
Pre-information and announcements are an important basis for Europe-wide competition.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
The preliminary information will contain the main public procurement information on the planned construction projects.
They are necessary for those construction projects where the estimated total contract value reaches or exceeds the EU threshold and where the contracting authority wants to shorten the tendering deadlines for open or non-open procedures.
In announcements, the contracting authority must provide binding details of the planned construction contracts to be awarded throughout Europe.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In it, he has to make known, among other things, the scope of performance, the process and execution dates, the special requirements as well as the evaluation criteria and their weighting.
When describing the object of the order, the common procurement vocabulary (CPV codes), which is unified throughout Europe, must be used.
Preliminary information and announcements will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the procurement profile of the contractor.
In order to avoid penalising foreign interested parties, notices at national level may not contain any additional information and may only be published after the notification text has been sent to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union.
Incomplete or incorrect information in the Notice may affect competition and may even encourage manipulation.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed the EU's pre-information and notice requirements into national law.
Different rules
In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and announcements must also be published in the case of construction services not to be awarded throughout Europe.
Procurement procedures may start at the earliest one month after sending the preliminary information to the EU Official Journal (for EU-wide contracts) or to the national Official Journal (for all contracts).
Only in exceptional cases can the publication of prior information be dispensed with.
In Germany, no prior information is required for non-EU-wide procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, announcements for public tenders and participation competitions must be published before limited tenders on the Internet portal of the Federal Government and, if necessary, also in newspapers or magazines.
In the case of limited tenders without competition, announcements of services to be awarded above 25,000 euros are required (ex-ante transparency).
All planned lots of the construction projects are to be listed in the preliminary information.
In Germany, this is of particular importance because of the small part of the detached construction contracts.
In the Czech Republic, the impact of this scheme is limited, as there are significantly fewer construction services divided into lots.
Key audit results
BRH
Pre-information
The contracting authorities examined published preliminary information for all audited construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe.
In some open procedures, however, they shortened offer deadlines, although the 52 days required between the submissions of the preliminary information and the announcements had not yet expired.
Other shortened procedures were only tendered after the 12-month period of validity of the preliminary information had already expired and before it had been extended.
Many published preliminary information lacked indications of the planned division of construction services into lots.
Announcement
Some of the notices of the audited bodies contained CPV codes which deviated from the information provided in the preliminary information or which did not accurately record the required services.
In individual cases, notices were published earlier at national level or contained more information - for example on implementation deadlines - than the notices in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Ex-ante transparency
The contracting authorities of an audited building administration had commissioned a service company to publish the national procurement procedures.
It published the notifications on its own paid award platform.
However, the contracting authorities did not check whether the company had also forwarded the notifications to the free internet portal of the federal government as required.
Samples showed that only one third of the audited administration's notifications were published on this portal.
NKÚ
Announcement
In the case of the construction of a wastewater treatment plant, the contracting authority did not specify in its notice the criteria on which it wanted to select the bidders.
The contracting authority could not prove how the bidders were selected.
The restriction of the number of bidders was permissible under the law in force at the time.
In the case of the construction of a motorway ring, in a non-open procedure, the contracting authority did not specify in the notice or in the documentation of the award procedure, according to which it wanted to assess the qualifications of the applicants and how many applicants it wanted to allow to compete.
In its assessment, the contracting authority concluded that all six applicants complied with the qualification requirements, but excluded the applicants with the worst ratings from the further procedure.
The procedure of the contracting authority was not transparent because it had not disclosed information on the qualification criteria and the evaluation procedure at any time of the procedure.
Publication of the announcements
During the refurbishment of former military grounds, the contracting authority did not publish the tender.
Summary findings
The two-stage system of pre-information and publicity is an important part of implementing the requirement for transparency in Europe-wide contracts, strengthening competition and thus also preventing corruption.
Both countries have implemented EU benchmarks and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures, including in the national procurement sector:
Selection of candidates for non-public types of award
In contrast to public procurement procedures, not every company interested in the performance of the services to be awarded can compete in non-public procurement procedures.
In the case of non-public procurement procedures, the contracting authority has to make a preliminary selection of which companies should be invited to bid.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption The EU rules allow for a limitation of the number of applicants in non-public procurement procedures across the EU.
However, in the case of non-open procedures, at least five companies must be asked to bid.
At least three companies must be invited in the case of negotiation procedures with a contract notice.
In any case, the number of applicants invited must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be made known beforehand.
The selection of companies to be requested is a process within the award procedure that is highly susceptible to manipulation, for example by unilaterally favouring certain companies.
In addition, restricting competition to a few companies also favours possible collusion between applicants.
In both cases, the award result may be significantly impaired at the expense of the client.
The contracting authorities must therefore take special precautions against possible manipulation, carry out adequate controls and, in particular, ensure the transparency and traceability of this procedural step.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
The rules for selecting candidates are similar in both countries.
In addition to the EU requirements, the contracting authorities should switch as often as possible among the companies to be requested when selecting candidates.
In addition, competition must not be limited to companies established in certain regions.
The contracting authorities have to justify the selection of candidates and to document the course of the selection process in their award notes.
Different rules
In Germany, in the case of limited tenders, at least three and in the case of freelancers, in principle, several suitable candidates must be asked to submit an offer.
Under the new Czech rules, apart from two specific areas, it is inadmissible to restrict the number of bidders in the case of non-open procedures and negotiation procedures.
In Germany, the multi-eye principle must be observed when selecting companies.
For example, if an employee has proposed a number of companies for a non-public procurement procedure, the management level of the construction service or a contractor from the contracting authority will usually have to amend this proposal by, for example, removing a proposed company and / or supplementing a new company.
The aim is to prevent an individual from being able to definitively determine the number of companies to participate in the competition.
Otherwise, in the event of manipulation, this could allow for far-reaching collusion among the parties involved.
The list of companies to be requested must be treated confidentially, including vis-à-vis freelancers, and not made accessible to the general public.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In the Czech Republic, there are no such rules on the establishment and secrecy of candidate lists.
Under the German rules, freelancers are not allowed to determine the companies to be requested, but can only submit proposals to the contracting authority.
There is a regulatory loophole in Czech legislation on this.
Key audit results
BRH
Number of applicants
The requirement to require a minimum number of companies to bid for non-public contracts has been complied with, with a few exceptions.
An evaluation of the BRH of almost 7,000 non-Europe-wide procurement procedures for construction services in construction construction showed that the contracting authorities asked an average of 6.6 companies to bid for limited tenders by the federal government in Germany and an average of 4.4 companies for freelance tenders.
Change of companies and regional restrictions
Especially in the case of trades with a few suppliers, the contracting authorities did not always change the circle of selected applicants.
In particular, they took into account companies already known to them and, in their view, tried and tested.
As a reason for this, they stated that, in the case of non-public proceedings, they had to ensure the suitability of the companies that were required to compete before they were invited to bid.
The BRH did not find an inadmissible restriction to regional bidders in non-public procurement procedures, but a higher proportion of regionally based companies than in public tenders.
The contracting authorities attributed this mainly to the fact that, on average, the scope of services in non-public procurement procedures is significantly lower and therefore, for example, longer access routes are more important than in public tenders.
Multi-eye principle and proposals for freelancers
Contrary to the rules, the contracting authorities largely failed to have the proposed list of companies to be amended by an independent person.
They justified this in particular by a lack of processing capacity, time pressure or insufficient knowledge of alternative suitable companies.
It was also often not documented who had proposed the companies requested to bid.
Some samples showed that freelancers had drawn up the lists of candidates and that these proposals had been adopted unchanged by the contracting authorities.
In this way, the contracting authorities did not protect themselves to the extent required from possible manipulation.
Confidential treatment of bidder lists
In the case of a contracting authority, the lists of companies to be requested were recorded in a data processing system, which could be viewed by all the staff of that service.
In the case of manipulative intentions, the names of the envisaged or authorised undertakings could have been passed on unauthorised and could, for example, have allowed for collusion among these undertakings.
Documentation
The documentation of the award procedures contained only a few justifications for the selection of candidates.
NKÚ
Selection of candidates
When building a motorway ring, the bidders did not receive any information on the evaluation criteria and the evaluation procedures.
In the case of the non-open procedures for the development and modernisation of waterways and ports, the notices did not contain any information on how the selection of applicants should be carried out.
In one procedure, all eight participating applicants met the qualification requirements, exceeding the specified maximum number of companies to be admitted.
The award committee then carried out a batch procedure for selecting the companies.
However, this approach, which was in principle permissible at the time, should have been cited as one of the criteria in the notice.
Summary findings
Due to the high risk of manipulation in the selection of applicants in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special precautions to prevent undue restrictions on competition.
With the multi-eye principle, the secrecy of the bidder lists and the sole power of the contracting authorities to propose the companies to be requested, the German requirements restrict such possibilities of abuse.
In the case of Czech rules, in particular, the newly introduced requirement of the largely unlimited number of bidders in the case of non-public procedures can counteract possible manipulative restrictions.
However, the audit findings have shown that some of these requirements have been inadequately implemented and that the potential for manipulation for abusive restriction of the field of participants has not been sufficiently reduced in these cases.
The contracting authorities should fully address the shortcomings identified.
Offer phase
With the announcement of the award or the call for tenders, the tender phase begins, during which companies can draw up tenders on the basis of the award documents sent to them.
Applicants can submit their offers until the expiry of the offer period set by the contracting authority.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
There are no separate EU rules for this phase of the award procedure.
The contracting authorities must comply with the national rules designed to counteract the possibilities of manipulation that exist during the tendering phase.
These are, above all, organisational requirements and controls.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
In principle, the award documents on the basis of which the companies are to draw up their bids must only be sent by the contracting authority.
Freelancers involved in the award procedure are not allowed to carry out this task.
The contracting authority must ensure that all applicants receive the same information during the tender phase.
In the event of ambiguities in the award documents or other questions relating to the call for tenders, only the contracting authority may provide information to the applicants.
Freelancers entrusted with the preparation of the award documents are not allowed to provide information.
During the entire offer phase, contact between the contracted freelancers and the applicants must be prevented.
Freelancers must not become a hub of the award procedure through which contacts with anti-competitive consequences can be established.
Offers submitted by post or directly submitted must be submitted in a closed envelope.
Offers sent electronically have a technical encryption.
Different rules
In Germany, the contracting authority can also commission external service companies with the printing and dispatch of the award documents, whose employees are obliged to keep the offers secret and to conscientiously comply with the contractual obligations.
In Germany, the offers received must be marked with an entrance stamp and sent directly, immediately and unopened to an official responsible for custody.
This official may not be involved in the award.
The offers received must be kept under wraps until the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, the offers received are marked with a file number.
The contracting authority shall record the quotation data, including order numbers, as well as the creation and receipt information, in a protocol.
The custody of the offers is not regulated in more detail in the Czech Republic.
Key audit results
BRH
The bidding phase audits focused mainly on the procurement procedures of a civil engineering administration.
Delivery of the award documents
The contracting authorities of the audited building administration sent the award documents themselves or had them printed and sent by an external service company.
Freelancers did not send award documents.
Information to applicants
For the most part, the audited building administration did not comply with the requirements for the separation of planning and award when appointing the contact persons for inquiries and information.
In the performance descriptions, contrary to the specifications, she did not specify employees from the contracting office, but from the project managers as contact persons.
Some award documents even contained the names of the freelancers who had compiled the performance descriptions.
In the case of inquiries during the offer phase, not all applicants received the same information in individual cases.
Labelling of offers
At the audited building administration, all offers received were provided with entrance stamp and entrance note.
In the case of some freelancers, however, the offers were received by freelancers, which contradicted the requirements for preventing corruption.
Preserving the offers
According to their identification, not all offers immediately and immediately reached the person responsible for custody, who included the offers in a steel cabinet.
In the meantime, in a construction service, the offers were placed in an open compartment of the post office, to which every employee had access.
Another service had hung up a letterbox in a hallway that was not constantly monitored, in which the offers thrown in there sometimes even remained overnight.
Since the throwing slot of this letterbox was large and unsecured, not only staff, but also visitors to the service, would have had the opportunity to extract and, if necessary, manipulate the offers received.
NKÚ
No shortcomings have been objected to on the Czech side.
Summary findings
In particular, during the tendering phase, contacts between interested companies and freelancers involved in the procurement process will be prevented in both countries.
By providing all bidders with the same information, the principle of equal treatment is also to be respected.
The rules on the receipt, custody and secrecy of the offers seem appropriate in order to counteract manipulation and corruption.
The corresponding requirements in Germany are slightly more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
The results of the investigation in Germany have revealed breaches of the rules in some areas.
These shortcomings could be remedied with little effort.
Opening up of offers
Opening up of offers
During the opening date, the previously closed offers will be opened and their contents will be read out and thus made known.
From the opening date, the bidders will be bound by their bids until the expiry of the award period set by the contracting authority.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
There are no separate EU rules for the opening of tenders.
However, for this highly sensitive phase of the award procedure, the national anti-corruption rules contain extensive requirements for the protection of tenders and competition.
The multi-eye principle as well as the transparency and traceability of the opening of the offer are intended to prevent manipulation and changes to the submitted offers.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
The opening date shall be carried out by several persons to be determined by the contracting authority.
The multi-eye principle is intended to prevent individuals from being able to manipulate the offers uncontrollably when the offers are opened.
In most procurement procedures, bidders can take part in the opening date.
Only offers submitted to the negotiator at the opening of the first offer are allowed for the opening.
In principle, offers received late may no longer be taken into account.
In order to ensure the transparency of the opening date, the actions carried out and the results of the opening of the offer must be set out in a protocol in which, among other things, the names of the bidders and the price of the offer must be recorded.
The Minutes are to be read out and signed by the negotiators.
It can also be signed by the bidders present.
Different rules
In the Czech Republic, a committee is conducting the opening of offers.
Freelance workers can also participate in this.
The Committee may also be entrusted with other phases of the award procedure, such as the evaluation of tenders.
In Germany, a negotiator and a secretary carry out the opening of the offer.
The negotiator must be an official of the tendering body.
The head of the negotiations and, in the case of contracts in construction, also the secretary should not be involved in the processing of the award documents as well as in the award and contract processing.
According to the German regulations, in addition to the offer prices, information on discounts and discounts as well as special features such as damaged or delayed offers must be recorded in the minutes of the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, in addition to the offer price, only the language of the offer and the signatory power of the applicant are recorded.
The German regulations stipulate that the open offers must be marked in all parts in such a way that subsequent changes and additions are prevented.
The offers are usually marked by perforations with the date of the opening date, they must be kept secret after the opening date and may only be made available to the persons directly responsible for the processing.
There are no similar Czech regulations.
If only one offer is received during a tendering procedure in the Czech Republic, it must not be opened and must be returned unvalued.
There is no such regulation in Germany, and if only one offer is received, it must be opened up and then valued.
Key audit results
BRH
Multi-eye principle
The audited contracting authorities implemented the requirements for the multi-eye principle at the opening dates.
They carried out the opening dates with negotiators and secretaries who were not entrusted with any other award procedures.
In the case of freelancers, however, there were occasional cases in which freelancers opened offers sent to them without the participation of the contracting authority.
Minutes
In the minutes of the opening dates, the opening of the offers was not always fully documented.
In some cases, for example, the late submissions were not registered, and in individual cases even signatures were missing.
Labelling of offers
The contracting authorities examined in the context of the cross-sectional examination marked the offers according to the specifications by a perforation with the date of the opening date.
Insufficient labelling has been found in past audits of some beneficiaries.
However, these contracting authorities changed their labelling practice after the complaint by the BRH.
NKÚ
Offer period
In the case of the award of road maintenance measures, an offer was received by the contracting authority only one month after the end of the tendering period, but the contracting authority accepted this offer.
Summary findings
The two countries' rules on the opening of bids coincide in significant parts, taking into account both the multi-eye principle and the principle of transparency, which can significantly limit the risks of corruption and manipulation in the opening of bids.
The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
In particular, the requirements for the precise documentation of the procedure as well as for the labelling, the safe custody and the secrecy of the offers significantly restrict the possibility of manipulation, such as subsequent changes to the offers.
In addition, those entrusted with the opening of tenders may not carry out any other tasks in connection with the service to be awarded.
The only few complaints in total prove the high acceptance of the requirements for opening up the supply.
Examination and evaluation of the offers
Examination and evaluation of the offers The client has to examine and evaluate the offers available at the opening date.
In doing so, it must determine the offer for the award of the contract, which best meets the requirements according to the given award criteria.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
The EU benchmarks provide for a multi-stage procedure:
First of all, the suitability of the bidders must be established.
Bidders must be economically and financially efficient and have the necessary professional and technical expertise.
In principle, companies that are legally convicted, for example, of bribery or fraud, must be excluded from participating in the award procedure.
The offers of the non-excluded bidders must be examined in mathematical, technical and economic terms and evaluated on the basis of the previously announced award criteria.
The client must determine the most economically advantageous offer, and the client must examine offers with unusually low prices in particular.
The examination and evaluation of tenders is a particularly susceptible phase of the tendering process.
For example, bidders can be unjustifiably excluded or offers that do not meet the requirements can be left in competition.
By favouring or disadvancing bidders, the value result can be inadmissibly impaired and thus the determination of the economically most favourable offer can be prevented.
The contracting authority must therefore take special precautions to ensure that the persons entrusted with the examination and evaluation meet the requirements of integrity and expertise.
It must also ensure the transparency and traceability of the procedure and of the decisions taken.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
In line with EU requirements, bids in both countries must be examined and evaluated in multi-stage procedures.
The requirements for the proof of suitability of the companies to be presented, as well as the award criteria to be taken into account in the assessment and their weighting are laid down in the notices or in the award documents and cannot be changed during the procedure.
After checking the suitability of the bidding, the eligibility criteria may no longer be used in the evaluation of the bids.
The rating must be limited to the award criteria.
The bids submitted must first be formally examined as soon as possible to determine whether they are complete and whether they contain, for example, abnormalities which could indicate possible intentions of manipulation.
If bidders are excluded from further examination and evaluation of their offers, they must be informed of this without delay.
If the valuation of the offers results in an unreasonably low price, the bidder must be given the opportunity to comment before a possible exclusion of his offer.
The decisions taken during the examination and evaluation of the offers must be documented in a comprehensible way.
Different rules
In Germany, the offers to be kept secret may only be made available to persons directly entrusted with the processing.
The inspection of the offers as well as the calculation of the offers may only be carried out by the contracting authority.
It will only have to employ staff who are not involved in the award decision or the implementation of the measure.
The performance of further audit and evaluation tasks is not regulated in more detail.
If freelancers are entrusted with the examination and evaluation, they must treat the offers confidentially.
They may only make proposals for the decisions to be taken by the contracting authorities.
In the Czech Republic, award committees are to be set up to examine and evaluate tenders.
The committees draw up evaluation reports with award proposals.
In the end, as in Germany, only the contracting authorities have to decide on the award of contracts.
If evidence or declarations required in Germany for the submission of an offer are only incomplete, the contracting authority shall give the bidders the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.
Only if the documents are still not available after the expiry of the deadline must the offer be excluded from the valuation.
In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the contracting authority whether it gives bidders the opportunity to complete the missing evidence or explanations.
If a bidder fails to do so, he must be excluded.
In Germany, in addition to the total price, the uniform prices (prices for partial services) of the offers must also be examined.
If, due to the price structure of the offer, there are indications of too low or too high prices for partial services, the bidder must be asked to dispel these ambiguities.
If he does not succeed in doing so and the contracting authority can provide proof of a mixed calculation of the prices, this offer must be excluded.
The aim is to prevent bidders from speculating on significant changes in the quantity of partial services when calculating their offer, which can lead to significant increases in the costs of the construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, the total price is assessed, but not the adequacy of the prices for partial services.
A mixed calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.
Offers with unreasonably high or low prices may not be awarded a surcharge in Germany.
If one or more offers fall below the correct price determination of the client or the offer amounts of the other bidders by 10% or more, the bidders must prove the correct calculation of their offers.
If they are not able to do so, the contracting authority may exclude the relevant offers.
In the Czech Republic, the call for tenders may be terminated after verification of profitability if only offers with unjustifiable prices are available at low prices.
Contrary to German public procurement law, the surcharge cannot be refused for this reason in the case of offers with prices significantly higher than the calculation of the client.
If there is a suspicion of restrictive behaviour in Germany, the contracting authority must report immediately to its technical supervisor at the leading level.
It must decide on the measures to be taken and whether to inform the antitrust authority or the public prosecutor's office.
For example, the leading level of specialist supervision must also agree to construction services of more than 50,000 euros if a contract is to be awarded on a voluntary basis, if a contract is not to be awarded on the offer with the lowest price or if the tender is to be cancelled.
There are no such rules in the Czech Republic.
Key audit results
BRH
Suitability and evaluation criteria
The vast majority of the tendering procedures examined complied with the requirements set out above.
For some companies proposed by freelancers, the contracting authorities did not check the suitability of the companies themselves.
A recipient of the grant commissioned companies without the required proof of suitability being fully available.
In some cases, it was not clear whether the contracting authority had taken into account all the announced award criteria in its selection decision or whether it had based its award decision solely on the "price" criterion.
Selection of the persons involved and confidentiality of the offers
Some contracting authorities used unauthorised persons to examine the offers for this purpose.
For example, freelancers or employees of the department involved in planning or carrying out a construction project carried out tasks that could only be carried out by employees of the contracting authority.
The construction services justified this with insufficient personnel capacity in the respective areas.
In some cases, the freelancers commissioned to examine the offers also participated in employees who were not obliged to keep the offers secret and to conscientious fulfilment of the contractual obligations.
For the construction services, it was also mostly incomprehensible whether the offers from the freelancers were only accessible to the persons directly commissioned with the processing.
Review and computational examination of offers
Some contracting authorities handed over the open offers to freelancers for further examination, without having previously carried out the prescribed review of the offers and the computational examination itself and had doctored their results.
In the case of manipulative intentions, third parties could have made changes to the offers without this being comprehensible to the contracting parties.
In the documents examined, abnormalities or missing price or product information were in some cases not marked or only inadequately marked.
Performance audits
In a sample in a building administration, the cheapest tenders in three-quarters of the tendering procedures audited deviated more than 10% from the previously determined estimated costs.
One in twenty tendering procedures has been terminated because of unreasonable bid prices.
Not all offer audits and reconnaissance talks with the bidders were comprehensible or sufficiently documented.
In many cases, there was a lack of further information, such as on the uniform prices of the most important positions.
Often the deviations were justified only on a blanket basis, for example by indications of changed market prices or increased material costs.
The construction services said it was difficult to detect and prove mixed calculations.
In the case of a call for tenders by an institution under public law, the offer price of the cheapest offer was 66% below the previously estimated value of these services.
Further calculations or investigations into the causes of this deviation were not documented.
In a reconnaissance interview, the contracting authority found no evidence of price dumping by the then contracted company.
This left it unclear whether the estimated value determined was excessive or whether the offer price was too low.
Later, the client rated the contracted company as a "low-cost company" that could not keep quality or deadlines.
In another call for tenders, a construction service awarded the contract for an offer whose price was 35% higher than the value of the calculation of costs.
It did not suspend the call for tenders, citing the non-factual reasoning that a reasonable calculation could be concluded at this company.
Suspicion of irregularities
In the case of an audited building administration, there were two cases of irregularities, both of which were reported to the level of specialist supervision.
In one of the cases, the calculation of two bidders was identical in a call for tenders, so that the contracting authority excluded both bids from the procedure.
In the application of the remaining rules, the audits did not give rise to any substantial objections.
NKÚ
Aptitude test
For many of the construction projects examined, including higher education, road construction and the extension of the rail network, the contracting authorities did not exclude bidders from the procedure, even though they did not meet the requirements specified in the tender documents or could not prove their suitability to the required extent. On the other hand, in one case, a contracting authority could neither prove nor explain why it had excluded a bidder who had fulfilled the requirements.
Rating
When awarding construction services for a water treatment plant, the contracting authority did not take into account the specified evaluation criteria when examining and evaluating the tenders.
In the case of a construction project for the expansion of the rail network, the contracting authority only determined the weighting of the evaluation criteria at the beginning of the evaluation.
In the case of road maintenance measures, the given criterion "shortening the construction phase" was misjudged in a procedure.
As a result, the proposed reduction was insufficiently taken into account by the bidders in second and third positions.
Documentation of the selection of offers
In three tendering procedures in the context of housing development, the contracting authority did not document which criteria it had applied and on what basis it had selected the successful bidder.
When building a motorway, the contracting authority selected the companies for smaller orders of up to 20,000 euros solely on the basis of telephone surveys on prices and delivery conditions.
Examinations of this selection were not possible, as the surveys were not documented.
Summary findings
The rules for the examination and evaluation of bids are in line with EU requirements in both countries.
However, when it comes to details of the procedure and the selection of the persons involved, the respective rules differ.
In Germany, the procedure is more regulated than in the Czech Republic by detailed requirements, in particular for the implementation of the multi-eye principle and for the protection of offers.
The same applies to the requirements on the basis of which the adequacy of the prices offered must be verified.
In both countries, some of the tendering procedures examined found that significant procedural steps in the examination and evaluation of tenders were not or were inadequately documented.
However, without the traceability and transparency of the audit and evaluation decisions, possible manipulative interventions will be encouraged.
A particularly serious defect was the handing over of all offers to third parties without the contracting authority having sufficiently examined and documented the offers beforehand and thus protected them from possible manipulation in the further proceedings.
When contracting authorities have tasks carried out in the examination and evaluation of tenders by third parties, sufficient precautions and an increased control burden are required to counter the increased risk of manipulation.
When assessing the adequacy of the prices, the audited services in Germany did not always make full use of the set of instruments and did not sufficiently examine the price structure of the offers.
In the Czech Republic, complaints arose in particular with regard to the aptitude test and the application of the evaluation criteria.
Conclusion of the award procedure
After the validation and value of the tenders, the award procedure will be completed by awarding the contract or by repealing the procedure.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
In the case of EU-wide procurement procedures, all bidders must be informed in advance of the proposed award decision.
Companies will have the possibility to examine the proposed award within 10 days in the case of information by electronic means or by fax or in the case of other means of communication within 15 days, and to initiate a review procedure if necessary.
A contract may not be concluded before the end of this information period.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
If a bidder submits a request for review within the information period, a conclusion of the contract is only possible after the final decision in the review procedure.
Companies can also have the award decision reviewed by an independent court in the context of this review procedure.
The purpose of the review procedure is to ensure the legal protection of the undertakings and to encourage the contracting authority to comply with public procurement law throughout the award procedure.
To do this, he must adequately document the procedure.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
Both countries have implemented EU rules on information and verification procedures.
In both countries, the contracting authority has to decide on the award of the contract.
However, it must not deviate arbitrarily from the result of a proper examination and evaluation of the offers.
The purchaser shall award the contract within the announced contract period,
also because the bidders are no longer bound by their offers after the expiry of the deadline.
In the case of open and non-open procedures or public and limited tenders, the client may not deviate from the content of the offer at the time of conclusion of the contract.
The inferior bidders must be informed promptly about the award decision and the reasons for not taking their bids into account.
Procurement procedures may only be lifted under certain conditions, for example if the bid prices are excessive or the tenders do not meet the requirements of the call for tenders.
Different rules
In the Czech Republic, there is also a 10 or 15 day obligation to provide information and wait before awarding a contract for construction services that are not to be awarded throughout Europe.
In Germany, these requirements apply only to the area of EU-wide procurement.
In the case of the other proceedings in Germany, bidders can only be informed of the award decision after the award of the contract has been awarded.
In the Czech Republic, a tendering procedure has to be terminated if only one bid has been received or only one bid has been assessed.
In Germany, the contract must also be awarded in the case of only one valuable offer, provided that it complies with the conditions of the call for tenders and is economic.
Key audit results
BRH
In the case of the contracts audited, there were only a few complaints when the award procedures were completed.
In some cases, companies received letters of contract for EU-wide contracts even before the expiry of the information deadlines, which may lead to the ineffectiveness of the contract.
Pursuant to open procedures, order letters also contained content deviating from the content of the offer in individual cases, such as changed dates.
In several cases, the contracting authorities did not comply with the contract deadlines.
In an open procedure, a contracting authority therefore awarded the contract for the second cheapest offer, as a company with a 50% cheaper offer was no longer prepared to carry out the services at the price originally offered after the end of the contract period.
NKÚ
In the case of a construction measure in the university sector, the contracting authority deviated from the bidder's offer in terms of content in the contract.
In the case of some contracts, for example construction measures for road maintenance, the construction of a motorway and a bypass road, the contracting authorities concluded the contracts after the expiry of the legal deadline.
When awarding construction services for the refurbishment of former military sites, the contracting authority only forwarded the notification of the award of the contract to all bidders after the expiry of the legal deadline.
Summary findings
Both countries have implemented the EU's benchmarks for concluding the award procedure.
The legal protection of the inferior candidates or bidders increases the range of instruments for preventing corruption.
The scope of legal protection in Czech public procurement law has also been extended to contracts below the EU thresholds.
In both countries, the deadlines for awarding contracts have been exceeded.
This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.
Building administrations should avoid the shortcomings identified in the completion of their procurement procedures in the future.
Documentation, reporting and reporting obligations
The award procedures must be clearly documented during their individual stages in view of the relevant findings and the justifications of the individual decisions.
In EU-wide procedures, the contracts awarded must be made known.
The order data will also be recorded in an EU statistics.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption The documentation of procurement procedures implements a fundamental requirement of the EU-wide transparency requirement.
A carefully and promptly prepared documentation allows only the traceability of the award decisions.
In particular, it also provides effective legal protection for tenderers when contracts are awarded above the EU thresholds.
Proper documentation is also an essential part of preventing corruption, as the compulsion to give detailed justifications for award decisions significantly limits the scope for manipulation.
The notice of a contract awarded in an EU-wide procurement procedure must be sent by the contracting authority to the EU Publications Office within 48 days.
The Office publishes the notices in the Official Journal of the EU and thus also implements the transparency requirement.
The contracting authorities must also collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and notify them to the European Commission through the competent national ministries.
On this basis, the European Commission draws up an annual EU statistic, which enables it to gain an overview of the development of the internal market in construction services.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed EU rules on documentation and reporting requirements into national law.
The rules on documentation and reporting for EU statistics are largely the same in both countries.
Different rules
In the Czech Republic, the obligation to publish contracts awarded is not only limited to EU-wide contracts, but also extends to other procurement procedures.
The notice period is shortened to 15 days.
In Germany, in addition to the EU-wide awards, there is a publication obligation only in the case of limited tenders and in the case of freelancers contracts with value limits of 25,000 euros or 15,000 euros without sales tax (so-called ex-post transparency).
Below these limits, as well as in the case of public tenders, only the companies involved in the competition procedure receive information on the award of contracts.
Key audit results
BRH
Documentation
A large number of the tendering procedures examined were not fully documented.
The award notices did not contain all the necessary information, such as the justification of product requirements or references to national rules.
In a tendering procedure, the contracting authority did not justify why it awarded the contract to a company, even though its offer had not included mandatory evidence to be submitted.
In a few cases, the documents of the contracting authorities did not contain all the evidence necessary for the documentation of the award procedure.
Notices on contract notifications
In some EU-wide procurement procedures, the contracting authorities failed to disclose the award of the contracts.
In the case of further award procedures, there was no evidence that the contracting authorities had made the contracts awarded known.
Reporting and reporting obligations
The statistical compilations viewed contained the required minimum information, which had been drawn up and sent on time.
Ex-post transparency
In most cases, the audited building administrations published the contract data of the completed procurement procedures.
In the case of a building administration, however, due to a transmission error, this data was not published.
The building administration only noticed this error after half a year,
so that the contract data of the tendering procedures concluded up to that date have not been published.
NKÚ
Documentation
In the case of construction measures for the organisation of a major sporting event, the documentation of the award procedures showed considerable shortcomings, mainly because of incorrect information, such as incorrect quotation prices in the minutes of the evaluation commissions.
In addition, some protocols of the offer openings were not signed.
Notices on contract notifications
In the case of several road construction projects, announcements about contracts awarded were only published late or not at all.
Summary findings
The rules on documentation and reporting and reporting requirements are broadly in line in both countries and implement the EU requirements.
This will, in principle, ensure the transparency of procurement procedures, including the award of contracts.
The rules to be applied in the Czech Republic for notification go slightly further than those in Germany.
The shortcomings identified in the documentation and in the notices significantly limited the anti-corruption effect of these instruments in the respective procurement procedures.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Building administrations should further improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and contracts and fully comply with their reporting and reporting obligations.
Summary evaluation and recommendations
The parallel audits of the NKÚ and the BRH have focused on two priorities which are essential for the award of works by public contracting authorities in the Czech Republic and Germany: the application of EU public procurement rules and the prevention of corruption.
The requirements of EU law allow for cross-border competition in order to create a European internal market.
Anti-corruption measures are not only intended to prevent, or at least reduce, corruption; they are also intended to avert economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the state.
The audit findings of the two Courts of Auditors on the application of public procurement rules in both countries, as well as the comparison of these rules, provide information on similarities and differences that can help both countries to develop their public procurement law and its application.
Application of EU public procurement rules
Both countries have transposed the EU's requirements for the award of construction services into national law.
Thus, in the Czech Republic and Germany, there is an important common basis for the award of works and for taking into account the essential imperatives of competition, equal treatment of the companies involved and the transparency of procurement procedures.
The building administrations of both countries have, in some cases, very extensively underpinned these bids by further administrative regulations.
The Czech Republic has also, to a large extent, transposed the requirements for the construction services to be awarded throughout the EU to its nationally regulated procurement procedures below the EU threshold.
However, the investigations carried out by the Court of Auditors have shown that the building authorities have not fully complied with the requirements of EU law in all areas.
The construction administration in Germany should further improve the quality of its procurement procedures in order to be able to eliminate the complaints that have been raised when implementing the EU requirements.
In particular, the audits carried out in the Czech Republic have identified risks that affect the profitability of the contracts.
For example, incomplete descriptions of services required additional services, which were often awarded in breach of legislation, and cost investigations were mostly inadequately prepared, and excessive qualification requirements reduced the number of potential bidders and restricted competition, especially in the case of transport buildings.
Prevention of corruption
The investigation has not been aimed at uncovering cases of corruption,
also because the Court of Auditors does not have the appropriate instruments to do so.
The Court of Auditors can, however, examine the extent to which the administrations of both countries have taken precautions against corruption and manipulation in the award of construction services and how these requirements are applied.
In the prevention of corruption, both countries have set different priorities.
In particular, the German rules provide for largely unrestricted competition, as well as transparency and controls as central elements of the prevention of corruption.
The main aim of the Czech legislation is to increase the transparency of procedures.
BRH
In Germany, general principles of the prevention of corruption apply, which the entire federal administration has to apply.
These principles are also implemented in the requirements for the award of construction services and are geared towards their specific needs.
In some cases, the relevant regulations set out very precisely the way in which the bids for the prevention of corruption should be taken into account in the course of the award procedures and in the selection of the persons involved.
In the BRH's view, in particular, the primacy of the principle of open procedure or public tendering is an appropriate instrument to significantly reduce the risk of corruption in the award of construction services, while restrictions on competition increase the risk of manipulative intervention.
Risk analyses and adequate controls (in particular the multi-eye principle), the requirements for transparency and documentation of procurement procedures, as well as various organisational measures are also effective measures to prevent corruption and manipulation.
The BRH therefore sees no need for fundamental changes to the corresponding requirements of the administrations in the award of construction services.
The rules on the prevention of corruption are largely taken into account in practice.
The shortcomings identified in some areas have highlighted shortcomings in the implementation of some benchmarks.
The building administrations should continue to train their staff on the requirements for preventing corruption and make them even more aware of this problem.
A significant part of the complaints related to tasks delegated by the building authorities to freelancers.
Without controls and adequate safeguards, however, the risk of abuse increases when delegating tasks.
Therefore, tasks at risk of manipulation and corruption should only be entrusted to third parties if the administration can ensure a sufficient level of protection against inadmissible interference.
NKÚ
At government level, the Czech Republic adopted a strategy against corruption, in which the public procurement sector is the most important element.
The Procurement Act and its implementing provisions have been substantially amended.
The NKÚ audits took place during the implementation of this strategy.
The strategy adopted and the new legal provisions should be effective improvement measures, as the contracting authorities will have to justify the profitability of the contracts, the calculation of the expected prices, the adequacy of the qualification requirements, the essential evaluation criteria and the nature of the evaluations, and duly document and publish all these aspects.
Recommendations
The NKÚ and the BRH assess the implementation of the EU requirements in principle positively.
The broad acceptance in practice has confirmed that the EU's imperatives of competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for the award of works within the European Union.
The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at facilitating and promoting cross-border competition.
In view of the enormous material and ideal potential for damage caused by manipulation and corruption in the award of construction services, both auditors see the building authorities in their countries as being called upon to continue and, if necessary, to improve their measures against corruption and manipulation.
In particular, the organisation and procedures of procurement procedures should be continuously examined for weaknesses and risks in order to identify the need for action and to take appropriate countermeasures.
The comparison of procurement practices in both countries suggests that the share of open proceedings in the Czech Republic should be increased, as open procedures offer a wider scope for competition and can significantly reduce the risk of corruption.
In addition, a greater division of construction services into lots can have a beneficial effect on bid prices, provided that this results in greater competition with a higher number of bidders.
Ensuring the correct implementation of procurement procedures is an essential basis for efficient procurement by public contracting authorities.
In Germany, the procurement procedures are carried out by the specialised building authorities, whereas in the Czech Republic, with the exception of the transport projects, these tasks are carried out by the departments themselves or contractors commissioned by them.
The auditors of both countries are concerned, even after the completion of their joint project, to further develop the findings that are important to them and, if necessary, to bring them to the parliament and government of their country.
Both auditors are also convinced that the principles of public procurement law set out in this report and its implementation are also of interest at the international level of the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), because the principles and findings set out are of general importance in order to combat corruption effectively and to ensure the economic award of works in a well-functioning and fair competition.

Football: Juve coach praises after top game: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker "played the best game together with the half hour of Valencia that evening," praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the record champion's 3-1 (1:1) victory against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive star was the decisive man in the important match against the pursuer even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and does it well," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from the moment we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goals, Juve turned the game after the early gap by the hit of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and hung off the worst pursuer for the time being.
The goalkeeper picked up by Real Madrid first put on former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double pack (26th / 49th).
And Ronaldo also did the preparatory work after a corner by header ball to hit head of defence Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who only had to push in just before the goal line.
"He gives a lot of templates," the coach praised.
But Allegri, of course, also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record goalscorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We have to get even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
The best Juve goalscorer is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.

Management of VAT in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Report on the audit
Preface
Taxes are the main source of revenue for public budgets.
A focus of the work of the Court of Auditors should therefore be on the audit of this area.
This applies in particular to VAT fraud.
This alone generates an estimated EUR 100 billion in tax losses per year in the European Union.
Already at the 6th EUROSAI Congress in Bonn in 2005, the participants pointed out the need for enhanced cooperation.
This allows the auditors, for example, to exchange audit approaches and to optimise audit practice.
The value added tax (VAT) is particularly suitable for cooperation as it is harmonised within the European Union.
In 2006, for the first time, the auditors of both states audited in parallel in the area of the USt.
The relevant audit report was published in 2008.
As VAT fraud is a widespread phenomenon in the European Union, there is a need for close cooperation between the Court of Auditors, so that it can be fully assessed whether the measures taken are appropriate to effectively tackle VAT fraud.
The two auditors decided to continue their cooperation and carried out a second parallel audit.
1. Introduction
Exam number: (CZ) 09 / 11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892
Object of examination: (CZ) Administration of USt (D) Bilateral audit with the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic (hereinafter NKÚ), audit
Objective of the audit:
(CZ) The administration of VAT and the treatment of selected transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as CZ) and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter referred to as Germany) should be examined, and the procedures applied by the financial authorities in the case of intergovernmental assistance should be examined.
(D) The purpose of the audit was to evaluate how the financial administration has implemented the recommendations made by the Court of Auditors.
In addition, other exam fields linked to the USt should be processed.
The findings made should be compared in order to determine whether tax procedures can be optimised.
The audit period covered the years 2006 to 2008, including relevant information from the period before the audit period up to the conclusion of the audit.
2. Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel examination
The Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany has agreed to carry out an audit of the administration of the USt.
During the previous parallel investigation, they had uncovered suspected cases involving intra-Community transactions,
which made another exam expedient.
On the basis of the audit findings, the two auditors made recommendations on the management of the USt.
The purpose of the audit was to evaluate how these recommendations were implemented and to investigate the suspected cases identified.
The audit also dealt with other issues, including selected cases of high-risk intra-Community transactions, mutual assistance in the recovery of VAT receivables and the audit of large companies.
The Court of Auditors found that:
1. Recommendations made on the basis of the previous examination
• Recommendation 1: Taxable registration rules should be harmonised within the EU
In the first audit, the Court of Auditors compared the registration procedures for the USt in the two states and found differences that caused problems.
The Court of Auditors therefore recommended harmonising the registration of taxable persons within the EU.
This has also been taken up at EU level.
The draft amendment to Council Regulation No 1798 / 2003 provides for the extension of the existing databases in the EU, including a database with the identification number of persons subject to VAT.
The draft also provided for common rules on the registration of taxable persons and their possible deletion.
The Court of Auditors expected Member States, in line with their decision in principle, to agree on appropriate rules to remove unreliable traders from the VAT system as early as possible.
Member States reached political agreement on the final version of the draft in ECOFIN.
The abovementioned common rules are no longer included in it, and the two Court of Auditors regret that.
They still consider such rules to be important in order to prevent VAT fraud.
• Recommendation 2: Monthly submission of summary notifications As a result of the first audit, the Court of Auditors recommended to Member States that the summary notifications (CMs) should in future be submitted on a monthly basis.
The amounts of intra-Community transactions could then be reviewed in more time.
Council Directive 2008 / 117 / EC amending Directive 2006 / 112 / EC on the common system of value added tax for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions has shortened the deadline for the levy of the ZM to one month.
In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by an amendment to the VAT Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.
In Germany, the transposition did not enter into force until 1 July 2010, so it did not transpose into national law the obligation to levy the ZM on a monthly basis in due time.
• Recommendation 3: Data comparison of the USt-Pre-Registrations and the ZM in Germany for more reliable MIAS data and proposal to examine the merging of the procedures for USt-Pre-Registrations and ZM The German Finance Administration has taken up the recommendation made by the Federal Court of Auditors and set up a working group to work out possible solutions.
Work has not yet been completed.
The Federal Court of Auditors will monitor the further development.
• Recommendation 4: Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches to a risk management system at EU level In the course of the first audit, the two auditors agreed that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by one Member State alone.
Successful criteria and elements or approaches of a risk management system must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State.
If this does not happen, fraudsters will focus on the Member State with the weakest risk management system.
The Court of Auditors found that the two Member States apply different risk management systems, which have both strengths and weaknesses.
The NKU examined the system of information exchange within the EU - EUROCANET, while the Federal Court of Auditors focused on German participation in the "Platform for Risk Management."
2. Verification of selected intra-Community transactions
During the first audit, the Court of Auditors had jointly examined transactions in which it was doubtful whether they had actually been carried out or which had been explained differently by the taxable persons of the two States in the preliminary declarations (or VAT declarations) or ZM.
The Court of Auditors selected nine cases of intra-Community deliveries of goods between the CZ and Germany for the audit.
The audits by the tax offices (FÄ) of both states had not yet been completed at the conclusion of the first parallel audit.
The audit showed that the tax procedures for these selected transactions have now been completed, and appropriate measures have been taken by the respective financial administrations (including subsequent VAT fixes or the prevention of pre-tax refunds).
3. Examination of selected, particularly risky intra-Community transactions
The audit also included highly risky intra-Community transactions between taxable persons in the EU covered by the EUROCANET system.
EUROCANET is used to identify risky taxable persons.
Member States can participate in this system on a voluntary basis.
The CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET. Germany has a passive status, i.e. it does not participate in the exchange of data within the framework of EUROCANET.
From the point of view of an active participant state, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to participate actively.
As a result, no information could be obtained about which suppliers with German VAT ID would have been classified as highly risky cases.
The NKU found both normal business incidents and those suspected of VAT fraud, including carousel fraud, in the selected transactions.
The FÄ were only able to check high-risk transactions to a limited extent, especially in the case of so-called "Missing Traders," although an examination of the documents alone is hardly sufficient to prove fraud to the taxable person.
Suspected carousel fraud in imports and exports
it is advisable for customs and tax authorities to work more closely together to monitor the usefulness of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final consumer.
Germany and a number of other countries have refused to participate actively in EUROCANET because they do not believe that there is a sufficient legal basis.
The Federal Court of Auditors found that the German financial administration uses other instruments to identify risky taxpayers.
However, there is a need for communication and exchange of experience between all EU Member States.
The Council of the EU agreed on a draft Regulation,
was created by EUROFISC.
The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should feed into the planned network to combat VAT fraud.
4. Mutual assistance in the recovery of claims
Intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims is subject to the same European legislation in all Member States.
Therefore, requests for intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in the CZ and Germany are dealt with in the same way.
The Federal Court of Auditors and the NKU compared the statistics that both Member States forwarded to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.
These statistics contained inconsistencies.
The two Court of Auditors consider it useful to reopen the debate on statistics at EU level in order to avoid future inconsistencies.
If this does not happen, the statistics cannot be used appropriately for comparisons.
In addition, the statistics should contain more information about the USt.
An analysis of detailed data can make it easier for the Commission to support Member States in their efforts to combat VAT fraud.
Both Court of Auditors consider that Member States with a low recovery rate should endeavour to achieve at least the average recovery rate.
The Commission should assist the Member States in this, if they so wish.
5. VAT test for large companies
The Court of Auditors analysed the legal situation with regard to the VAT audit of large companies in both states.
In addition, they used a questionnaire to collect information from the financial administrations that they considered important in this context.
It became clear that the situation in both states is different.
For the selection of risky cases, the CZ has a system that includes a large amount of relevant data (including information on VAT audits, balance sheet data, and profit and loss accounts).
The overall control of VAT can thus be effectively controlled and analysed.
A special financial office for large enterprises is to be set up in 2012.
Germany does not yet have a similar system, which makes it difficult to control and analyse the overall USt-control system.
The German financial administration focuses more on the selection of relevant individual cases and relies in particular on data from the USt-Pre-Registrations or USt-Declarations and the ZM.
Various risk management components, which are to be improved, support the evaluation of this data.
3. Examination procedure
3.1 Examination procedures in the Czech Republic
Division II - State Budget Revenue and Regional Departments IX Pilsen, X České Budějovice, XIII Brno and XV Ostrava audited for the period May 2009 to February 2010.

3.2 Examination procedures in Germany
The audit area for traffic taxes and employees of the assigned PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt / Main and Munich audited from February 2009 to February 2010.
After selecting the examples, they announced the review in several countries:
• Bavaria, • Hamburg, • Hesse, • North Rhine-Westphalia, • Saxony.
Tax records from the following FÄ were included in the audit: • Erlangen, Zentralfinanzamt München, Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; • Hamburg-Nord, Hamburg-Hansa, Sonderfinanzamt Hamburg for large companies; • Wiesbaden I, Wiesbaden II, Darmstadt; • Essen-NordOst, FA Essen for tax audits at large companies and corporations, Lüdenscheid; • Chemnitz-Süd.

The Federal Court of Auditors informed the Federal Ministry of Finance of the audit results in April 2010.
3.3 Cooperation between the two Courts of Auditors
In the run-up to the parallel audit, the representatives of both Court of Auditors met in September 2008 to discuss and define the audit issues.
In December 2008, the Presidents of both Court of Auditors signed the Memorandum of Understanding on Co-operation in Parallel Audit.
At a meeting in Bonn in June 2009, the audit teams briefed on the initial results obtained during the preparation of the exam, discussed possible approaches to the exam and agreed on the way forward.
A second meeting took place in Prague from 2 to 4 December 2009.
The audit teams exchanged the audit findings obtained by then and agreed on the timetable for the preparation of the joint audit report.
The two Courts of Auditors identified the following issues for their parallel audit: • Evaluation of the recommendations made in the previous report; • Review of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between taxable persons from the CZ and Germany, which could not be fully clarified during the first parallel audit; • Review of selected intra-Community transactions classified as risky between taxable persons from the CZ and Germany; • Examination of the procedures of the two tax administrations with regard to intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of VAT receivables; • VAT audits for large companies.
The report on the results of the parallel audit was prepared during a working meeting in June 2010.
4. Audit of the management of turnover tax in selected areas
4.1 Implementation of the recommendations of the first joint examination
4.1.1 Implementation of the recommendations in the Czech Republic
Recommendation 1
Harmonisation of the conditions for the registration of taxable persons within the EU
In response to the results of the first audit, the Czech Court of Auditors has recommended adapting the requirements for VAT registration and introducing new rules for the deletion of registration in the CZ.
These amended rules should reduce the risk of possible tax evasion more effectively.
In certain cases, it was found that the FÄ did not delete the VAT registration of taxable persons if they did not comply with their obligations under Czech Law No 235 / 2004 (hereinafter referred to as the "VAT law").
So far, the Czech Ministry of Finance has not submitted an amendment to oblige the FÄ to be deleted if the taxable persons repeatedly do not submit VAT declarations.
According to the Czech VAT law, the FA may cancel the registration of a taxable person on its own initiative if (a) the taxable person has not made transactions for twelve consecutive months and has not informed the FA of the reasons for doing so; (b) the taxable person has not fulfilled his obligations under the VAT law; (c) the taxable person no longer fulfils the conditions for the tax obligation.
The first investigation showed that, on the basis of the existing legal situation, FA Prague 1 must delete the VAT registration of "foreign taxable persons" 3 with effect from 31 January of the following calendar year if they were not obliged to register and pay USt in the current calendar year.
FA Prague 1 often did not delete the VAT registration of these taxable persons because the relevant provision of the deadline could not be adequately implemented in practice.
The problem was solved by the amendment of the VAT law, which entered into force on 1 January 2009.
Accordingly, the FA has the power to delete the registration of a foreign taxable person if he has not provided either taxable or tax-exempt supplies of goods or services entitled to deduction of VAT in the previous calendar year.
Recommendation 2
Monthly levy of the ZM
On the basis of the initial audit, the Court of Auditors had recommended that the monthly levy of ZM be introduced.
The Council Directive, which shortened the turnaround for the levy of the ZM to one month, was implemented in the CZ by the VAT Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.
The ZM must now be delivered electronically.
In addition, a ZM must be surrendered if services whose place of performance is to be determined in accordance with § 9 (1) of the VAT Act are provided to a person registered in another Member State as subject to turnover tax.
The condition is that the recipient is obliged to declare and pay the tax for these services, which is the result of Council Directive 2008 / 8 / EC amending Directive 2006 / 112 / EC as regards the place of the service.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of the data of the USt-Pre-Registrations and the ZM to increase the reliability of the MIAS data This recommendation related to the German financial administration.
In its ATIS4 system, the Czech financial administration automatically compares the data on intra-Community transactions from the VAT declarations and the ZM.
Recommendation 4
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level
The proper collection of the UST is a prerequisite for the proper functioning of the EU's internal market.
That is why the fight against VAT fraud is of paramount interest and has received considerable attention in recent years.
The importance of this is demonstrated, among other things, by a study published by the European Commission in October 2009.
An external expert estimated the loss of VAT for the 25 Member States in the period 2000 to 2006. Based on the analysis of the available data, the tax loss for the aforementioned period was estimated at between EUR 90 and 113 billion, based on the fact that the EU-25 lose an average of 12% of their turnover taxes each year.
The estimated tax loss for CZ in 2006 was 18%.
The first audit found that a Member State alone cannot develop an effective risk management system (RMS).
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each Member State.
With regard to the RMS, the Czech Court of Auditors has examined the system for the exchange of information within the EU (EUROCANET).
Risky intra-Community transactions carried out by taxable persons within the EU and recorded in EUROCANET were selected for this purpose (see Chapter 4.3).
The aim of the EUROFISC network is to optimise mutual assistance in tax matters and to combat VAT fraud more effectively, and to improve cooperation between the competent authorities in order to detect fraud as early as possible.
Later, EUROFISC could be used as a tool to assess the risk potential of intra-Community transactions.
The ECOFIN Council 6 already approved EUROFISC on 7 October 2008 and at the same time adopted the principles governing the functioning of the system.
EUROCANET, developed by the Belgian financial administration in cooperation with the other Member States and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF7, serves as a model for EUROFISC.
The purpose of the system is to detect risky transactions and to identify entrepreneurs involved in organised VAT fraud.
4.1.2 Implementation of the recommendations in Germany
The evaluation of the recommendations of the first report led to the following findings:
Recommendation 1
Harmonisation of the conditions for registration of taxable persons within the EU
On the basis of a detailed questionnaire, the German tax administration has developed a well-functioning system for the registration of taxable persons.
The Federal Ministry of Finance presented this system to the Commission in October 2007.
The system itself is constantly being improved.
The data provided in the questionnaire will now be collected electronically and will be available for research later, so they are part of the risk management at registration.
The Commission had made a proposal 8 to amend Regulation 1798 / 2003, which included common standards for the registration and deletion of taxable persons.
There was still a need for clarification and clarification among Member States.
The Federal Court of Auditors had recommended to the Federal Ministry of Finance not to fall short of the standards already achieved.
Recommendation 2
Monthly levy of the ZM
On 8 April 2010, a Law 9 on the transposition of EU Directives into national law was adopted.
It contains, inter alia, provisions on the monthly levy of ZM for intra-Community deliveries
and will enter into force on 1 July 2010.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of data from the USt-Pre-Registrations and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and consideration of merging the previously separate procedures for submitting the USt-Pre-Registrations and the ZM
A joint federal and state working group has been set up,
which has developed a concept for the automatic comparison of data from the VAT pre-registrations and the ZM.
The approach is still being discussed with the countries.
In addition, this working group has looked at an approach to optimising the control procedure for intra-Community transactions.
Recommendation 4
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level. Information will be exchanged at EU level.
Germany participates in the Risk Management Platform.
The European Commission supported this initiative and, by written procedure of 18 October 2006, initiated the establishment of a risk management platform within the Fiscalis 2006-2007 Action Plan.
The members of the Platform dealt with the following topics in 4 subgroups: • Risk Management Instruments, • Influence of Taxable Persons' Behaviour, • Evaluation, • Updating the Risk Management Guide.
New reports from the sub-groups "Risk Management Instruments" and "Updating the Risk Management Guide" were published in early 2010.
4.1.3 Evaluation
Registration
The question of the conditions for the registration of VAT and its deletion in different countries has been dealt with at EU level.
The draft amended Council Regulation 1798 / 2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT and repealing Regulation (EEC) 218 / 92 provides for the extension of existing databases within the EU, including a database of VAT identification numbers.
This proposal also includes common standards for the registration and deletion of taxable persons.
The issues of registration and deletion are, until further notice, reserved for the national legislation of the EU Member States.
There was still a need for clarification and clarification among Member States.
The Federal Court of Auditors had recommended to the Federal Ministry of Finance not to fall short of the standards already achieved.
Member States reached political agreement on the final version of the draft at ECOFIN on 8 June 2010.
It no longer contains common rules for the registration and deletion of taxable persons.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The two courts of auditors regret this, and they still consider such rules to be important in order to prevent VAT fraud.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Monthly levy of the ZM
With regard to international cooperation, as a result of the previous audit, it was recommended that all Member States introduce the monthly levy of the ZM in order to allow for an earlier examination of the amounts of intra-Community transactions.
Council RL 2008 / 117 / EC amending RL 2006 / 112 / EC on the common system of value added tax for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions has shortened the turnaround for the levying of the relevant CM to one month.
In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by the amendment to the VAT Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.
Germany did not implement the obligation for the monthly ZM levy until 1 July 2010 and thus did not implement it on time, while the CZ complied with the EU requirements.
Comparison of data from the USt-Pre-Registrations and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and consideration of merging the previously separate procedures for submitting the USt-Pre-Registrations or the ZM
The German financial administration has taken up the recommendations of the Federal Court of Auditors and set up a working group to develop possible solutions.
The Federal Court of Auditors will monitor the further development.
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level
Germany and the CZ use different approaches to identify risky entrepreneurs.
The Czech Court of Auditors examined the application of the EUROCANET system in CZ (see Section 4.3).
The Federal Court of Auditors focused on the German participation in the risk management platform.
4.2 Verification of selected intra-Community transactions
The first audit carried out a joint investigation into transactions where there were doubts as to whether they had actually been carried out or whether there had been inconsistencies in the notifications of taxable persons in both Member States.
The two Court of Auditors selected nine cases of intra-Community deliveries of goods between the CZ and Germany for which the tax examination by the FÄ of the Member State concerned had not yet been completed at the time of the previous joint audit.
1)
In the first quarter of 2005, a Czech taxable person purchased goods worth €22,686 from a German taxable person.
The Czech taxable person did not declare the acquisition in his VAT declaration, since the German taxable period did not have a VAT identification number, but only a tax number for intra-German transactions.
By means of international administrative assistance pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the competent Czech FA had received information that, according to German VAT law, the supplier of intra-Community goods does not need a VAT identification number in order to be able to benefit from the tax exemption for intra-Community supplies of goods.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that, according to the audit carried out by the competent Czech FA, the Czech taxable person submitted an additional VAT declaration declaring the purchase of goods of the abovementioned value and at the same time asserting his right to deduct VAT at the same level.
2)
A Czech taxable person is alleged to have purchased goods worth €12 561 from a German taxable person in the fourth quarter of 2004.
However, he said he had not purchased the goods and therefore did not declare them in his VAT statement.
The German financial administration, citing a provision of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, refused to deal with the request because the turnover associated with the acquisition did not exceed the threshold value of 15 000 euros.
As the Czech FA was unable to obtain documents, the tax audit remained inconclusive and the original tax fixing remained in place.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech FA received two spontaneous information from Germany in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, according to which the German taxable person had invoiced the delivery of the goods concerned to a Slovak addressee.
The Czech taxable person acquired the goods from the Slovak taxable person and stated the acquisition in his regular VAT declaration for the month of October 2004.
3)
A Czech taxable person is alleged to have purchased a car worth EUR 48 500 from a German taxable person in the fourth quarter of 2004.
However, he did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.
In addition, he had not issued a USt-Statement since August 2004, which is why the FA set the USt at CZK 0 for the quarter in question.
On the basis of information provided from Germany in the course of the international exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the FA requested the taxable person to submit a retrospective tax return in March 2007, but the taxable person failed to do so.
The audit found that the FA had carried out further investigations in this tax case in 2007, finding that the car in question had been sold by the taxable person to a used car dealer in the CZ.
The Czech FA carried out an assessment for the December 2004 tax period, setting additional taxes of CZK 295 379 for the purchase and resale of goods from another Member State.
The competent Czech court decided to open insolvency proceedings concerning the assets of the Czech taxable person; an insolvency administrator was appointed.
In the absence of significant assets, the outstanding tax debt is likely to be unrecoverable.
4)
In the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, a Czech taxable person is said to have delivered new vehicles (passenger cars) worth a total of €198 167 to Germany.
In response to a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, it was stated that tax proceedings were pending against the German taxable person in Germany.
The audit carried out by the Federal Court of Auditors showed that, at the end of the proceedings, there was evidence of the involvement of the German taxable person in fraud.
The intra-Community purchase of goods was subject to labour taxation of €182 424 (for 2004) and €369 690 (for 2005).
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech taxpayer was involved in carousel fraud involving new vehicles.
On the basis of information provided by the German tax administration, a VAT audit of the Czech taxable person has been carried out for the tax periods April, May and June 2005.
On the basis of the audit findings and the information from the international exchange of information, the FA set an additional tax of CZK 703 031 for May 2005 and CZK 726 551 for June 2005.
5)
The Czech taxable A is alleged to have purchased a machine with a total value of 58 000 euros from a German taxable person in February 2005.
In the third quarter of 2004, the German taxable person is said to have delivered a machine worth EUR 88 027 to the Czech taxable person B, but B denied the acquisition.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that B had acquired the machine from a German company with a branch in the CZ.
The Czech taxable A did not indicate the purchase of the goods from the aforementioned German taxable person in its VAT declaration.
The reply of the German FA to a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 showed that the German taxable person had not made an intra-Community delivery of a machine worth 58 000 euros, but a delivery within the CZ.
In the audit, the Federal Court of Auditors found that the intra-Community supply of the machine was classified as a domestic supply after completion of an audit and that the VAT exemption was subsequently refused.
6)
A German taxable person is said to have delivered goods worth EUR 11 600 to a Czech taxable person in the third quarter of 2004.
The goods were purchased and later sold in Germany, i.e. in 2005.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech FA had made its assessment on the basis of a supplementary VAT declaration which unduly identified acquisitions from another Member State, including purchases in the above-mentioned amount.
The Federal Court of Auditors found that after receiving a reply to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the German FA corrected the VAT declaration of the German taxable person and set an additional tax of EUR 1 600.
An investigation is ongoing due to the resale of the goods in Germany and the corresponding VAT predisposition there.
The ZM of the German taxable person has not yet been corrected, as in Germany only the taxable person who has surrendered the ZM can correct it.
7)
The competent Czech FA received a request for information from the German tax administration in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 on the question of the purchase of a car worth EUR 47 400 by a Czech taxable person in February 2005.
After an audit for the 2005 tax period, the Czech FA fixed the tax debt of the Czech taxable person at CZK 0 and informed the German FA that it could not confirm the purchase of the car by the Czech taxable person.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the registration of the Czech taxable person had been deleted because he had not complied with his tax obligations.
The Czech FA had forwarded the documents to the Czech police.
The German taxable person has not yet corrected his information in the ZM, but has appealed against the tax decision.
8)
According to MIAS10, between the third quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, a German taxable person supplied a Czech taxable person with a total value of €33,205, which he did not declare to be an intra-Community acquisition.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors found that the Czech FA investigated the reasons for the inconsistencies.
The Czech taxable person repeatedly issued subsequent VAT declarations for the first quarter of 2005.
However, the Czech FA was unable to clarify the difference in the amount of acquisitions amounting to CZK 134 273 in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005 on the grounds that sales for individual quarters could not be accurately attributed and accepted the VAT declarations issued.
9)
In the third quarter of 2004, a German taxable person delivered goods worth EUR 46 854 to a Czech taxable person.
For the same period, the Czech taxable person declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only EUR 14 856.
In the context of the intergovernmental exchange of information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the Czech FA verified the actual value of the delivery.
The German reply to this question sent three invoices indicating a total value of the delivered goods of EUR 31 998, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech taxable person and the MIAS data.
According to the results of the audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors, following repeated warnings from the FA, the Czech taxable person submitted a retrospective VAT declaration for the July 2004 tax period in January 2007.
With this declaration, the taxable person simultaneously asserted his right to deduct VAT, and his tax liability for the tax period in question remained unchanged.
The audit confirmed that most of the tax procedures relating to the transactions selected for the audit had been completed and that the financial administrations in the CZ and Germany had taken appropriate measures (including ex post VAT fixing or prevention of pre-tax refunds).
4.3 Examination of selected cases of risky intra-Community transactions
4.3.1 Findings in the Czech Republic
EUROCANET can be an important source of information to identify risky taxable persons in the Member State of acquisition.
In the CZ, the early-warning information obtained from EUROCANET is checked by the competent FA in the case of the purchasers.
Since the first quarter of 2008, CZ has included information on sales and taxable suppliers that are considered to be risky in the EUROCANET system.
Nine Czech taxable persons have been selected for the audit,
which had been entered into EUROCANET by the financial administrations of other Member States either as suppliers or purchasers.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Since the German financial administration did not participate in the exchange of data via EUROCANET, it was not possible to determine whether suppliers with a German VAT identification number were classified as risky by the German financial administration.
The investigation found both normal business incidents and those suspected of carousel fraud or other VAT fraud.
In these cases, the FÄ exchanged information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003,
For example:
• The FÄ did not find any suspicion of risky sales when examining the early warning information.
The taxable persons concerned were constantly monitored because their data was stored in EUROCANET.
• During the audits of risky transactions, the FÄ failed to demonstrate, on the basis of the accounting documents submitted, breaches of the rules on the calculation of the tax base and the tax, even though they found inconsistencies in the transport and storage of the goods or revealed business relations with letterbox companies from other Member States.
• The review of individual business incidents was complicated because certain taxable persons did not cooperate with the FÄ and could not be contacted.
The competent FÄ reviewed most of the risky taxable persons and transactions mentioned in early warning notifications from EUROCANET.
However, their ability to check risky transactions, especially so-called "Missing Traders," is limited.
In particular, a mere examination of the documents can hardly prove that the taxable person is acting fraudulently.
Stricter requirements for the registration of taxable persons for purposes of the UST and greater flexibility in the deletion of registrations would help to combat VAT fraud.
The taxable persons involved in fraudulent carousel transactions can be registered for the purposes of the USt in order to pretend fictitious deliveries of goods across the EU or to issue formally correct tax evidence to other taxable persons, with which they then assert unjustified claims for deduction of VAT.
In the case of suspected carousel fraud in connection with imports and exports, it is advisable that customs and tax authorities cooperate more closely in order to monitor the usefulness of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final consumer.
Member States can participate in EUROCANET on a voluntary basis.
The fact that three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate was seen by the European Parliament at the end of 200811 as a weakness of the system, which was to be remedied by the establishment of a EUROFISC network with compulsory participation.
4.3.2 Findings in Germany
The Federal Court of Auditors evaluated data available to the Federal Central Tax Office, including data from EUROCANET.
They served as the basis for the selection of six German taxable persons whose files were checked.
Both Germany and a number of other countries refused to participate actively in EUROCANET.
That is why Germany has a passive status, which means that it does not send data to Brussels itself, but is only the recipient of EUROCANET data.
This is justified by the fact that "from the point of view of the Federal Government
no unambiguous legal basis [exists] that would allow the tax secrecy that exists in Germany to be broken.
In addition, the Federal Government does not have reliable information on how information sent by the Member States is processed within the framework of EUROCANET. "12 Since October 2007, the Federal Central Tax Office has been evaluating the EUROCANET data and transmitting it to the financial authorities of the Federal Government and the Länder on the basis of a coordinated procedure.
The German FÄ will receive control notifications on the direct business relations of the taxable persons registered with them with companies from other EU countries covered by EUROCANET.
However, the German FA does not receive any information as to whether the company from the aforementioned other EU Member State has business relations with a company established in another Member State, which is also in business with the German company under the control notice.
4.3.3 Evaluation
The CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has only a passive status.
From an active participant's point of view, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to participate actively.
Accordingly, the audit had to be carried out in different ways in this area.
However, there were no significant differences in the success of detecting VAT fraud, due to the fact that EUROCANET is only one component of the risk management system.
However, the financial administrations of both countries have a wide range of other tools at their disposal to detect fraudulent transactions, and yet it is necessary to develop a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.
The Council of the European Union agreed on a draft Regulation 13 establishing EUROFISC, a network for combating VAT fraud.
The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should be shared by the Member States at European level and incorporated into this network.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The cases brought before the courts at national and European level show that there is a need for discussion between the Member States and the Commission on the conditions for exempting intra-Community transactions.
4.4 Mutual assistance in the recovery of claims
4.4.1 Intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic
The legislation on intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of certain claims in the EU is essentially based on:
Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, levies and customs duties;
Council Directive 2001 / 44 / EC amending Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, levies and duties and as regards VAT and certain excise duties, and
Commission Directive 2002 / 94 / EC laying down detailed rules for the implementation of certain articles of Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures.
The CZ implemented Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC by Law No 252 / 2000 on intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of certain claims.
After the adoption of Council Directive 2001 / 44 / EC, it also had to be transposed into Czech law, and at the same time an amendment to the aforementioned law was necessary.
In this context, legislative amendment No 191 / 2004 on intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of certain claims was adopted.
A new key piece of legislation was adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1179 / 2008 of 28 November 2008.
The annexes to this Regulation contain new application forms to be used from 1 January 2009, and the Regulation also makes electronic transmission obligatory and obliges the requesting authority to certify the conformity of all documents sent with the original.
The main principles of international administrative assistance for the recovery of claims are:
1. The principle of reciprocity applies;
2. Mutual assistance must always be provided only on request and subject to fulfilment of all conditions;
3. Mutual assistance does not extend to claims which are considered a criminal sanction in the requested State;
4. The intergovernmental assistance procedure for the recovery of claims must be carried out in accordance with the national law of the requested State;
5. In the recovery procedure, foreign claims do not take precedence over domestic claims;
6. Mutual assistance is provided only for the recovery of undisputed claims;
7. The principle of utilisation applies: the requesting State shall use all means to which it is entitled under national law to recover the claim.
Law No 191 / 2004 provides for three forms of mutual assistance: the provision of information, the notification of legal acts and the actual recovery.
Procedures for outgoing requests to other EU Member States
The competent FA shall electronically transmit the request for information, the request for notification of legal acts or the request for recovery, together with the relevant documents, to the Ministry of Finance of the CZ via the relevant Finance Directorate.
The Ministry of Finance of the CZ arranges the translation of the request into the language in question, scans it with all the installations and transmits it via the communication network or the CCN / CSI common interface to the competent financial authority of the State concerned.
A request for recovery aid must meet the following condition: the claim must exceed EUR 1 500 and must not be older than five years.
The requested authority may refuse recovery if the requirements are not met.
Procedure for incoming requests from other Member States
The Ministry of Finance of the CZ must confirm the receipt of requests from other Member States as soon as possible, at the latest within seven days.
If it decides not to accept the request, it must inform the requesting authority of the reasons for the rejection, specifying the specific provisions of the directive on which it is based.
The corresponding notification must be sent no later than three months after the date of receipt of the request.
Once the request has been received, the Ministry of Finance will check whether the request fulfils all legal requirements.
If the recovery request is granted, the FA shall, among other things, determine the debtor's assets, for example by extracts from the Land Registry, inquiries about existing bank accounts and registration of motor vehicles with the registration authority.
After six months from the date of receipt of the confirmation of receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ shall inform the requesting authority of the outcome of the investigation carried out.
The requesting authority must also be informed if the taxable persons concerned are not reachable and the claim cannot therefore be recovered.
All sums successfully recovered must be transferred to the requesting authority within one month of recovery.
The Czech FA dealing with the recovery may, with the consent of the requesting state, agree on the claim or payment of instalments.
Interest or default surcharges imposed on the debtor for the period of delay pursuant to Law No 337 / 1992 on the management of taxes and fees
are the responsibility of the requesting State.
In particular in 2006 and 2007, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ delayed forwarding the recovery requests received to the competent FA.
The same applies to the forwarding of the recovery requests made by the Czech FÄ to the competent authority in the requested State.
The investigation revealed that the Ministry of Finance had breached the Law on Intergovernmental Assistance for the Recovery of Claims by failing to inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the state of play of the recovery procedure within six months of confirmation of receipt of the request.
The situation has improved since 2008.
Statistical data
In accordance with § 13 (4) of Law 191 / 2004, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ compiles a statistic for the European Commission by 15 March of the year, which contains the number of requests for information, notification of legal acts and recovery received in the previous year, including the amount of the respective claims.
On the basis of the data provided by the Member States, the European Commission draws up its report to the Council and the European Parliament on the application of the provisions on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims.
The audit found that in 2008 the Ministry of Finance of the CZ stated the claims too low by EUR 5 250 000, due to the incorrect indication of the amount of a VAT claim lodged in 2008 (caused by the postponement of a decimal comma in the conversion of the claim from Czech kronor into euros).
The error was then reflected in the statistics of the European Commission.
Information on mutual recovery assistance can be found in the table below.
4.4.2 Intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in Germany
The legal basis for intergovernmental assistance in tax matters is Council Directive 2008 / 55 / EC of 26 May 2008 (EC Recovery Directive) 14 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1178 / 2008 of 28 November 2008 (EC Implementing Directive).
In order to improve readability and clarity, the EC recovery directive codified Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC of 15 March 197616, the provisions of which had been substantially amended on several occasions.
It regulates, among other things, the recovery of US dollars and taxes on income and assets, including the associated interest, fees and default surcharges.
The EC Recovery Directive was transposed into German law by the Recovery Act (EC) 17 of 3 May 2003.
The enforcement procedure in Germany is regulated in the Tax Code (AO).
§ 117 (2) of the AO provides that the financial authorities may provide intergovernmental legal and administrative assistance by virtue of international treaties and legal norms of the European Communities applicable in national law, as well as by virtue of the EC Law on Mutual Assistance.
Part Six of the AO (§ 249-346) contains the legislation for the enforcement procedure.
The administrative actions of the financial authorities govern, in particular, the enforcement and enforcement orders.
The Federal Ministry of Finance agreed with the representatives of the Supreme Financial Authorities of the Länder on the principles of mutual assistance in tax matters and transferred its own competence in this area to the Federal Central Office for Taxation 18.
The general conditions for admissibility of a request for recovery aid are:
• The legal requirements must be met (§ 251, 254 AO).
• All funds available domestically have been exhausted.
• The claims for the recovery of which mutual assistance is requested are unquestionable.
• The period between the issuance of the enforcement order or the date on which the claim or title became indisputable and the date of the request may not exceed five years.
• The claim must be at least 1 500 euros.
Procedures for outgoing requests to other EU Member States The German requests for the recovery of residual taxes are forwarded by the enforcement bodies of the FÄ through the competent central authority and the Federal Central Tax Office to the foreign authority concerned, e.g. the Czech CLO.
The details are set out in the leaflet on intergovernmental assistance in tax collection (recovery) of 19 January 200419.
This leaflet is currently being revised by a federal and state working group and adapted to the new recovery directive.
The request, along with installations, will be forwarded electronically by the FA to the funding authority.
The latter checks whether it is correct in terms of content and form.
If not, the request will be returned to the FA concerned.
Otherwise, it will be forwarded to the Federal Central Tax Office.
The Federal Central Tax Office then takes over the necessary communication with the foreign authority in question.
Procedure for incoming requests from other EU Member States
Requests for recovery from other Member States are recorded in the Federal Central Tax Office, which sends a confirmation of receipt within ten days.
It also examines whether the formal conditions have been met.
In principle, the Federal Central Office for Taxation passes these requests on to the central authority, which directs them to the relevant FA and supervises the execution.
The Federal Central Office for Taxation also sends interim or final reports.
If the processing of a request lasts longer than six months, it reminds the funding authority of the obligation to submit an interim report under Article 16 of Commission Directive 2002 / 94 / EC.
After examining the formal and factual conditions for the admissibility of the request, the enforcement bodies shall notify the relevant measures.
All amounts collected must be transferred to the bank account indicated in the request within one month of receipt.
Statistical data
Information on mutual recovery assistance between Germany and the CZ for the years 2006 to 2008 (as of 31 December 2008).
4.4.3 Examination of selected recovery cases
A total of 21 intergovernmental recovery requests between the CZ and Germany were selected for the examination, and ten cases are listed below.
The following findings were found:
1.
On 20 October 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German request for recovery of VAT debts from a Czech taxable person in 2004 and 2005 for a total amount of EUR 3 883 (CZK 109 820).
It was only on 26 February 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the competent FA.
In order to secure the claim to be recovered, the Czech FA burdened a property belonging to the taxable person with a land pledge right.
Since the contaminated property was not sufficient to pay the entire tax debt, a instalment payment agreement of at least CZK 2 000 per month was concluded with the debtor.
An interim report was sent to the German FA on 31 August 2009, according to which the taxpayer had in the meantime paid tax debts amounting to CZK 49 600 (as of 25 August 2009).
The amount was transferred to Germany and shortly thereafter, on 28 August 2009, a further 3 000 CZK were transferred.
2.
On 7 January 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a recovery request for tax debts (tax, income tax) as well as interest and fees from a Czech taxpayer amounting to a total of 180 869 euros (= 4 434 915 CZK).
It was only on 27 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the competent FA.
After reviewing bank balances, securities, real estate, motor vehicles and other movable assets, the FA found that the debtor did not have pledable assets.
Investigations on the ground also revealed that the debtor had been absent from his permanent residence for almost a year.
His whereabouts in the CZ were unknown.
This communication was received by the Czech Ministry of Finance on 6 April 2009 and forwarded to the German Finance Administration on 16 April 2009.
3.
On 21 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for USt together with interest and fees totalling EUR 3 139 (= CZK 84 846).
It was only on 6 August 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the competent FA. On 18 February 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance from Germany was informed that the Czech tax debtor had now settled the debt.
On 9 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance informed the Czech FA that the case had been closed because the Czech tax debtor had fully settled his debts in Germany.
However, the debt was also paid in the CZ as part of the recovery procedure and the corresponding amount was transferred to Germany on 27 October 2008.
Due to the long time it took the Czech Ministry of Finance to pass on the information to the FA, the tax debt was paid twice - by the taxable person himself in Germany and by means of recovery by the competent Czech FA.
In cooperation with the Federal Court of Auditors, it has been established that the amount recovered will be offset with the tax debt from another procedure, which amounts to EUR 6 649 and should be transferred to the CZ in September 2008.
In the documents of the Czech Ministry of Finance, there was only one recovery request for the company concerned amounting to EUR 3 139, and the recovery request of EUR 6 649 could not be found there.
4.
On 15 September 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for income tax, tax, interest and fees amounting to a total of EUR 39 957 = CZK 956 654.
It was only on 19 December 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the competent FA.
On 1 June 2009, the recovery procedure was initiated and a decision was taken to seize the Czech bank balance and the debtor's salary (CZK 7 000).
During the negotiations with the FA, the debtor did not agree with the amount of the tax debt and the amount was controversial.
According to the Czech FA, the debtor had in the past been willing to pay 250 euros per month, but the competent German FA did not agree with this.
The taxable person pledged to discuss his matter with the German FA in order to agree on a different amount.
The recovery procedure was not yet completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.
5.
On 19 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for income tax for 2005 and tax for the years 2003 to 2007, together with interest and fees totalling 113 444 euros = 3 116 304 CZK.
It was only on 14 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to FA Prague 1, which is authorised to deal with tax cases of taxable persons not resident in the CZ; on the basis of the available address, a local competent FA could not be determined.
In its investigation on 19 September 2008, the FA received information and documents indicating that the debtor's income was EUR 4 704, but it was unable to issue an enforcement order because the recovery request had been received after that date.
On 26 January 2009, the Czech FA initiated the recovery procedure and issued an enforcement order for the attachment of the debtor's assets to credit institutions.
The recovery procedure was not yet completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.
6.
On 3 October 2006, the competent Czech FA requested intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of a VAT debt together with procedural costs totalling CZK 146 223 742.
It was only on 13 May 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German Finance Administration.
On 8 September 2008, the competent German FA, through the Bundesbank, transferred to the Czech authorities the amount of €17 700 = CZK 439 226 collected by attachment of accounts.
A conversion error was discovered during the verification of the amounts collected.
The amount to be recovered of CZK 146 223 742 was converted at the exchange rate of 1 Euro = CZK 25,065, but a comma error resulted in an amount of EUR 583 378.
The correct amount of the amount to be recovered amounted to EUR 5 833 782.
As a result, a recovery request was submitted, which was too low by EUR 5 250 404.
7.
On 1 March 2007, the competent Czech FA requested recovery for a VAT debt, together with interest and fees from a Czech taxable person, amounting to a total of CZK 1 970 632 = EUR 79 847.
It was only on 10 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German Finance Administration.
On 4 February 2009, the German FA asked the debtor to pay the arrears.
Taking into account the significant reduction in the company's sales in the second half of 2008 and in particular in the first half of 2009 as well as the corresponding liquidity situation, the following payments were made to settle the overdue tax debt: EUR 4 600 on 8 April 2009, EUR 3 000 on 6 May 2009 and EUR 2 500 on 16 June 2009.
These payments were transferred to the account of the competent FA in the Czech Republic.
On 23 June 2009, a further payment of EUR 2 500 was agreed between the debtor and the FA until 30 June 2009.
8.
On 22 May 2008, the competent Czech FA requested the recovery of tax debts totalling €398 653 = CZK 9 832 779, which included, among other things, land acquisition tax.
It was only on 2 October 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German Finance Administration.
The request was returned in a letter sent by the German Finance Administration to the Czech Ministry of Finance on 3 April 2009.
The German financial administration justified this on the grounds that the property acquisition tax was not a tax within the meaning of Article 2 (e), (f), (g) and (h) of Directive 2008 / 55 / EC.
In addition, Article 2 (g) concerns liabilities arising from taxes on income and assets.
Accordingly, Article 3 of Directive 2008 / 55 / EC applies to taxes on income and assets not mentioned in Articles 1, paragraph 3 and 4 of Directive 77 / 799 / EEC.
The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed to send a new recovery request to the German financial administration, which should no longer include the property tax arrears of CZK 61 759, but the residues in the tax, corporation and income tax.
The Czech Ministry of Finance received a new request from the competent FA for the recovery of tax debts of the same taxable person amounting to CZK 7 079 735.
9.
On 6 February 2006, the competent Czech FA sent the Czech Ministry of Finance a recovery request for income tax and tax totalling CZK 3 445 782 = EUR 123 328.
The VAT debt was CZK 1 133 967.
It was only on 18 April 2007 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German Finance Administration
and only on 11 November 2008 did the Czech Ministry of Finance send to the Czech FA the reply of the German Finance Administration of 9 July 2007,
On 11 June 2007, the German FA issued an enforcement order for the attachment of the bank account and the bank announced that it was not in business with the taxable person in question.
This meant that the request for the German financial administration was considered to have been completed.
10.
On 26 September 2005, the competent Czech FA submitted to the Czech Ministry of Finance a recovery request for VAT debts totalling CZK 1 296 845 = EUR 43 591.
The relevant Finance Directorate submitted the request to the Ministry of Finance on 10 October 2005.
The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request to the German Finance Administration on 15 December 2005.
Prior to the submission of the request, the Czech FA carried out the tax requirement by attaching the accounts to banks and collecting salaries, as well as by burdening a property.
Prior to the recovery request, a request for information was sent to the German financial administration on 16 March 2005.
According to the letter of reply sent to the Czech FA on 16 September 2005, the Czech taxable person resided in Germany and had income from non-self-employed activities amounting to EUR 8 437. On 20 April 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a reply to the recovery request and only forwarded it to the competent Czech FA on 12 February 2008.
According to this, the tax debt in Germany is unrecoverable due to the debtor's inability to pay.
No assets have been found, and the income from non-self-employed activity is already the subject of other enforcement measures.
The German financial administration thus considered the request to be completed.
4.4.4 Comparison and evaluation
In the case of recovery, all EU Member States are subject to the requirements of EU law for intergovernmental assistance.
The procedures for processing requests are therefore similar in the CZ and Germany.
The Federal Court of Auditors and the NKÚ have compared the statistics submitted by the two Member States to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.
There were inconsistencies.
In its 200620 report, the European Commission recommended that Member States draw up their statistics with greater care.
In 200921, the Commission concluded that, despite a larger number of requests for assistance, the inconsistencies in the statistics have decreased.
Both auditors believe that a renewed debate at EU level on statistics would be useful in order to avoid the remaining inconsistencies in the future.
If this does not happen, the statistics are conditionally meaningful and cannot be used for comparisons.
In addition, the Court of Auditors considers that the statistics should show both the annual number of requests and the type of claims (e.g. VAT, income tax) and the amount of amounts collected per Member State.
By analysing more closely the statistics submitted by the Member States, the Commission could help Member States to assess their measures to combat VAT fraud.
Since the recovery rate can be calculated per Member State, the Court of Auditors argues that Member States with a low quota should at least aim for the average recovery rate within the EU.
At the request of a Member State, the Commission could play an active role in this.
The foreign recovery requests received by the CZ Ministry of Finance were forwarded to the relevant FÄ, particularly in 2006 and 2007, with a delay.
The same applies to the recovery requests made by the Czech FÄ.
The investigation showed that the Czech Ministry of Finance was in breach of Law No 191 / 2004 on Intergovernmental Recovery Assistance in so far as it did not inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the progress of recovery measures within the six-month period from the receipt of the request.
4.5 Value added tax audit for large companies
4.5.1 Value Added Tax Audit for large companies in the Czech Republic
General
The taxation procedure for large enterprises is subject to the same rules as for other taxable persons.
The audit of large enterprises is regulated by Czech Law No 337 / 1992, the "Tax and Fee Administration Act."
The Czech Ministry of Finance defines large enterprises as natural persons who have set up a business or legal persons who have been set up to carry out a business and whose net turnover for the tax period in question is at least CZK 2 billion, according to the income or corporate tax return.
The taxable person is classified as a large company on the basis of the turnover level according to the income or corporate tax return in the respective tax period; for the first time in 2003.
A natural or legal person will no longer be held as a large company for the purposes of sales taxation if, in three successive investment periods, their net turnover in the tax period is less than CZK 2 billion.
A taxable person can only be removed from the list of large companies if at least one type of tax has been examined beforehand for a tax period.
By the end of 2009, all large enterprises were audited at least every five years.
Since 2010, taxable persons have to be assessed in writing at least every two years, and the subsequent control measures are intended to eliminate the tax risks and their negative impact on the proper setting and collection of taxes.
The FÄ audits should focus on at least one type of tax; they usually cover several tax periods.
The large taxable enterprises were audited by the special audit bodies or audit services of the competent FÄ set up for a total of 13 FÄ.
A Special Audit Office carried out audits in its local area of responsibility in accordance with the instructions of the Head of the Finance Directorate.
She also checked
taxable persons with unusual and special business activities; and
those whose examination required a high degree of expertise and time.
Taxpayers with complex location distribution and organisational structure will also be examined,
Taxpayers suspected of large-scale tax evasion
as well as taxable persons belonging to chains and networks suspected of large-scale tax evasion and unjustified deduction.
Information on the number of audits carried out by the special audit bodies of the FÄ and the additional tax results of these audits are shown in table no. 3.
The Czech Ministry of Finance has submitted a proposal to amend Law No 531 / 1990 for the regional financial authorities, in particular the creation of a special financial office with national competence for selected taxable persons (legal entities established for the purpose of economic activity with a turnover of at least CZK 2 billion).
4.5.2 Value added tax audit at large companies in Germany
General
The audit of large companies is not particularly regulated in Germany, and audits are subject to the general regulations • of the Tax Regulation (AO), • of the Financial Administration Act (FVG) and • of the Audit Regulation (BpO).
There are also work aids.
Tax regulation
The provisions of § 193 to 203 AO "Section 4 - External Audit" contain, in particular, rules on the admissibility of an external audit and its factual scope, distribution of responsibilities, form and content of the audit announcement, audit principles, duty of participation of the taxable person and conditions for final discussions as well as for the transmission of the audit report.
External examinations are carried out by the competent FÄ (§ 195 AO).
Financial Administration Act Pursuant to § 5 (1) No. 1 in conjunction with § 19, it is the responsibility of the Federal Central Tax Office to participate in external audits of the FÄ.
The nature and scope of this participation will be agreed between the authorities involved.
In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office may require certain companies it has named to be audited at a certain time.
In this case, it may lay down rules for the external audit of these taxable persons.
Audit Regulations Pursuant to Article 108 (7) GG, the Audit Regulations (BpO 2000) were adopted with the consent of the Federal Council.
It applies to external audits of the state financial authorities and the Federal Central Office for Taxation.
In accordance with § 3 BpO, the companies are regularly classified in size classes.
Large companies must undergo a follow-up examination (Section 4.2 BpO).
Pursuant to Section 33.1 of the BpO, each competent financial authority has to keep a list of companies within the meaning of the regulation.
Working aids for the administration
In addition, the following work aids have been issued to the administration:
• "Single Manual for the Special Audit of the European Union";
• VAT country-on-line - USLO (= dialogue system in the intra-Community VAT control procedure) with guidance on the use of the data contained in the MIAS on intra-Community business relations;
• Working aids for difficult and special situations.
• Central database for storing and evaluating cases of VAT fraud and developing risk profiles - ZAUBER;
Taxpayers are classified in size classes based on criteria such as turnover and profit, with limit values varying depending on the business sector.
The figures are published by the Federal Ministry of Finance.
The values are reviewed every three years and fixed for the following three years.
The number of companies - not just large ones - is regularly recorded (last cut-off date: 1 January 2010).
In general, large companies have to be fully audited.
The audits will be announced and will usually cover the USt,
This means that the audit covers all relevant taxes, namely income tax, corporation tax, business tax and tax.
The turnover tax can be audited either by auditors or by special auditors.
Practice varies and depends on the administrative structure of each country.
The number of tax periods covered by an audit usually varies between three and five years.
The BpO 2000 assumes three years.
The audit is subject to all taxes at which a company has been charged.
4.5.3 Management of the VAT audit at large companies
According to the agreement, both auditors did not examine individual cases and investigated the way in which the financial administrations deal with the audit of large companies.
With the help of a questionnaire, they collected information from the financial administrations that is essential for the audit of large companies.
• What statistical records and evaluations for the audit of large companies are available to the management of the tax administration?
In particular:
• Are there statistics or records on the extent to which a distinction is made between the fight against VAT fraud and the general VAT audit?
CZ: No, the current version of the ATIS system does not allow such a distinction.
Germany: The financial administration does not distinguish between audits to combat VAT fraud and general VAT audits.
• Are there statistics or records of the timing of the exams?
CZ: Information on the timeliness of audits of intra-Community acquisitions of selected tax-payers is recorded in the ATIS system;
The same applies to information on the start and end of the examination of the FA.
Germany: No, the statistics for auditors summarised at the federal level only contain information about the so-called average last audit period (year).
This figure does not give an overview of the audit periods selected for individual companies.
Special auditors will focus on the last utilisation periods and will also be authorised to audit large holdings.
The statistics for special auditors at the federal level do not contain any information on the size class of the audited company.
• Are there statistics or records of the type of additional result; for example, divided by:
(i. real additional result (e.g. application of a reduced rate instead of the general VAT rate)
ii. unreal additional result (e.g. relocation / postponement of a situation which is not objectionable under sales tax law to another tax period)
iii. Cash effectiveness (payment of the fixed additional result)
CZ:
The Czech tax administration monitors the number of tax audits carried out, the amount of the additional tax result broken down by type of tax, the number of taxable persons audited and the number of tax periods audited.
Other tax procedures (on-the-spot investigations, payment procedures) will be monitored in the same way.
Regardless of this, the amount of repayments and the incoming payments will be recorded.
Statistics on tax debts are broken down by type of tax, but there is no distinction between tax debts incurred by a tax return and those resulting from audit actions by the FA.
Germany: No, the statistics for auditors and special auditors summarised at the federal level do not differ according to the above-mentioned criteria.
Most financial authorities, which carried out local surveys, also did not differentiate in this respect.
• Are inconclusive exam fields recorded?
CZ: Yes, the FA can select audit cases on the basis of criteria linked to selected indicators deposited in the ATIS system.
Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and special auditors do not provide such information.
However, the finance ministries of the federal government and the Länder have agreed on a common approach.
According to this, auditors and tax investigators of the countries must enter into ZAUBER the additional tax result they have achieved if a certain threshold value is exceeded.
In this case, supplementary information must be provided, for example on the origin of the additional VAT result achieved.
• Which are the most common findings?
CZ:
- Large taxable companies have unjustifiably used deduction of VAT for related deliveries and services;
• which were not used for an entrepreneurial activity according to § 72 (1) CZ UStG;
• which were used for representation expenses pursuant to § 75 (3) CZ UStG;
• due to invoices that do not meet the requirements of § 73 (1) CZ UStG
- large taxable companies have omitted the registration of VAT to be paid as provided for in § 21 (1) CZ UStG.
Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and special auditors do not provide such information.
Findings on the UST from audits of large companies are not recorded separately by the countries.
However, the Federal Central Tax Office can evaluate the ZAUBER database, in which auditors and tax investigators of the Länder have to enter the additional tax result they have achieved if a certain threshold value is exceeded.
• Does the financial administration analyze exhaustive audit fields and draw conclusions for strategic governance?
CZ: Yes, for example, national checks are carried out on risky goods and industries.
Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and special auditors do not provide information on particularly "fruitful" audit fields.
Concerning the analysis of such information, the usefulness and the way in which it continues to be used, there were different views among the survey bodies.
Some senior finance directorates provide such information to the FÄ, but the FÄ are free to use it or not.
4.5.4 Comparison and evaluation
As a result, large amounts of information are processed automatically in the CZ, including data from VAT audits as well as key figures from balance sheets, profit and loss statements in the system.
The CZ is able to control the selection of risky cases on the basis of a wide range of information.
The same applies to the evaluation and management of VAT audits in general.
In the CZ, the establishment of a special financial office for large enterprises is planned for 2012.
In Germany, the financial administration does not collect comparatively large amounts of data.
Accordingly, it is more difficult to perform these tasks in the same way.
The focus is more on the selection of relevant individual cases.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Qualified auditors select the cases to be examined and ensure the correct taxation on the basis of the information provided in advance VAT declarations or VAT declarations as well as test notes.
In order to reduce revenue losses at the USt and at the same time increase the risk of being discovered for unreliable entrepreneurs, appropriate management processes and risk management systems must be put in place.

5. Conclusions
The cooperation between the two auditors has proved its worth.
This has enabled the necessary knowledge to be gained on the systems used in both countries: in particular: • intra-Community transactions, • risk management at the USt, in particular with regard to the selection of risky transactions, • recovery of VAT receivables and • VAT auditing of large companies.
The audit revealed differences in the strategies for detecting VAT fraud and in the systems explained above.
These findings can be used to improve existing procedures.
They can also be used to initiate a discussion among interested bodies on which audit approaches and strategies can be used to combat fraud, for example in relation to relations within and between the Member States and the European Commission.
The experience and knowledge gained should encourage the joint examination of the administration of the USt in the future.

From pure fruit growing to ecology
The 125th anniversary of the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege was celebrated with a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle.
On 29 September 1893, the last founding impulses for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach were set with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a big anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.

The county association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the county also left no doubt about this, county managing director and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors through the long history of the county association with a picture lecture and reported, among other things, on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.

This also includes welcoming the new citizens to our clubs, added Wolfram Vaitl, President of the Bavarian State Association.

Report on the results of the parallel audit of the management of the VAT of the Czech Republic and Germany
Preface
The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, emphasises that the Court of Auditors has the power to audit all public finances.
The declaration requires that the courts of auditors have the power to scrutinise tax collection as much as possible.
The Organisation of the European Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxes to be an important part of public revenue.
The thematic focus of the 6th EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the audit of public revenues by the Court of Auditors.
One of the most important steps towards optimising the audit activities of a Court of Auditors is the development of a specific strategy for auditing public revenues.
This is particularly true for taxes, which are the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of default.
As national economies are increasingly interlinked and interdependent, there may be a situation in which national auditors can only carry out their audit work in cooperation with the auditors of other states.
As an example, the examination of internationally organised fraud can be considered, which can lead to significant revenue losses in many countries.
Cooperation between the authorities is necessary in the fight against such crimes.
Courts of auditors in this area must be prepared to cooperate closely with each other.
The idea for an audit of the VAT and the MIAS system arose at the 6th EUROSAI Congress in Bonn, which was carried out in cooperation between the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Court of Auditors.
In the course of a thorough preparation, the participating auditors first had to familiarize themselves with the legal framework and procedures of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.
On the basis of the evaluation of the available information, we made the selection of the examination subjects for the examination planning.
Achieving the efficient and effective management of VAT is a long-standing problem and individual states (in particular the EC Member States) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify the collection of VAT and create greater transparency in this area.
We are convinced that the results of our audit can not only contribute to improving the work of financial management, but can also form the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international exchange of information.
Report on the results of the parallel audit of the management of the VAT of the Czech Republic and Germany
Introduction
Reference: CZ) 06 / 27 (DE) VIII 2 - 2005 - 1215
The subject of the examination:
(CZ) Management of VAT following the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union
(DE) Examination of administrative cooperation in the field of VAT in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and 1925 / 2004
the Commission's audit objective:
(CZ) The purpose of the investigation in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedures applied by the financial administration in the field of VAT following the integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter "EC") with the free movement of goods and services, as well as the use of MIAS1, in particular the control of the use of the VAT exemption for intra-Community supplies.
(DE) The purpose of the audit was to examine the system of intra-Community VAT control, with a focus on mutual assistance in the field of VAT in accordance with the abovementioned regulations.
As a result of the audit, weaknesses should be identified and recommendations should be made to address them.
VAT Information Exchange System The audits were carried out jointly by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic ("NKÚ") and the Federal Court of Auditors ("BRH") of the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of an agreement concluded on 8 June 2006.
The cooperation focused on the verification of selected business transactions between entrepreneurs from the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the exploitation of information obtained through international administrative assistance between the financial administrations and the comparison of the VAT management systems in the two countries.
A joint final report on the results of the audits has been prepared in accordance with European Guideline No 31 for the implementation of the INTOSAI audit standards.
The period examined covered the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005.
Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel examination
The parallel audit of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two auditors.
In addition to the focus on the exchange of information provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and Commission 1925 / 2004, other closely related aspects were also examined, such as the registration of tax documents, tax returns and summary notifications.
The audit also covered the legal situation of cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach and the comparison of statistical data.
Comparing the systems of VAT administrations in the two countries, differences were found in the following areas:
1) Registration for sales tax purposes.
Whereas in Germany, entrepreneurs are registered irrespective of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among others, the essential criterion for registration is the exceeding of the turnover threshold laid down in the VAT law.
In the Czech Republic, tax payers receive only one tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, the tax payer receives a tax number valid only for domestic transactions for the purposes of sales tax.
If the German tax payer wants to make significant intra-Community transactions, he must apply for a special identification number, the so-called USt-IdNr.
As problems arise from the different registration procedures, the rules should be harmonised within the EC (see 4.1).
2) Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach.
In the Czech Republic, the cross-border carriage of passengers by bus and coach is free of VAT, but there is a right to deduct the VAT.
In Germany, the transport service, as far as the route passes through Germany, is subject to sales tax.
Efforts should be made at EC level to harmonise the situation in accordance with Article 393 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of turnover tax (see 4.2).
3) Tax returns.
Whereas in the Czech Republic tax returns only have to be made for under-year tax periods (month or quarter), tax payers in Germany have tax returns (monthly or quarterly)
Submit VAT advance notifications and a VAT annual declaration after the end of the calendar year.
In contrast to the Czech Republic, tax payers in Germany have to submit the VAT advance notifications electronically.
The introduction of the requirement for the electronic submission of VAT returns in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of the Czech tax administration (see 4.3).
4) Summary notifications.
While tax payers in the Czech Republic have to submit their summary notifications to the tax offices (FÄ), German tax payers have to submit the summary notifications to the CLO2.
Accordingly, the information contained in the summary notifications will be available to FÄ in the Czech Republic as soon as they have been submitted.
The information from the summary notifications will only be available to German FÄ after their processing by the CLO.
In order to combat VAT fraud, updated information on intra-Community transactions is needed as quickly as possible.
The monthly submission of summary notifications would shorten the period between the date of turnover and the updating of MIAS data.
This would allow for a timely examination of taxation in the purchaser's Member State (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduce the same deadlines.
5) International exchange of information in the area of VAT.
In the case of incoming requests for information, the Czech CLO monitors compliance with the three-month period.
The German CLO does not monitor the processing times.
As a result, the German financial administration has completed a significantly lower percentage of requests for information received within the prescribed period.
Due to these problems, the BRH has recommended to the German CLO that the deadlines be constantly monitored (see 4.6).
6) Risk management.
Each of the two Member States is in the process of developing its own risk management system (RMS) with appropriate strengths and weaknesses.
The NKÚ and the BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by a Member State alone.
Successful criteria, elements or approaches of an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EC Member States, otherwise fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5).
As part of the cooperation, the two Court of Auditors examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions carried out between Czech and German tax entities.
Of these, 31 cases were jointly examined using the legal possibilities of the CLO where there were doubts about correct taxation or suspicions of VAT fraud.
The Court of Auditors found that:
In some cases, the FÄ used the information obtained in the international exchange of information and reestablished the VAT liability of the tax payers concerned.
In these cases, the tax payers had either unlawfully claimed the VAT exemption or did not indicate the purchase of goods in their VAT return.
In some cases, the FÄ could not use the information obtained in the exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used because of different legal requirements in the two Member States.
In some cases, the financial administration of another Member State refused to provide the information requested.
Some cases have been uncovered in which tax payers incorrectly reported sales in their summary notifications.
As a result, the data in the MIAS were correspondingly incorrect, so that the experts (the FÄ) had to investigate in these cases (see 6).
Examination procedure
Examination procedure in the CR
The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by Division II - "State Budget Revenue" and the Territorial Audit Departments of Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and Northern Moravia.
The audited bodies were: Ministry of Finance and the 10 FÄ Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadaň, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Třinec.
The College of the NKÚ approved the audit findings on 23 April 2007.
Examination procedure in Germany
The audit was carried out between July 2006 and February 2007 by the audit area of traffic taxes and employees of the assigned PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt / Main and Munich.
It was part of the work plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006.
After a test phase, the actual test began in the 4th quarter of 2006.
In accordance with the cases selected by the BRH and later by the NKÚ, the BRH had to announce the examination in several federal states.
Apart from interviews in the BMF and the CLO, the examination was carried out in the following federal states:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
Tax records from the following FÄ were included in the audit:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, München-Körperschaften, Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nord and Hamburg for large companies, Hannover-Nord, Winsen-Luhe, Bonn-Innenstadt, Köln-Mitte, Köln-Porz, Köln-Süd, Sankt Augustin, Pirmasens, Bautzen, Chemnitz-Süd, Dresden II, Freiberg, Leipzig I and Zopau.
In addition, talks were held with the FÄ Augsburg-Stadt, Aurich, Düsseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.
The results of the examination were communicated to the BMF in May 2007.
Cooperation between the two Courts of Auditors
In the run-up to the parallel audit, several meetings of representatives of both auditors took place.
The participants in these meetings familiarized themselves with the organisation of the financial administration, the legislation on sales tax and the system of sales tax administration in each other's country.
The subject of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006.
The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.
At this meeting, a timetable for the further procedure was drawn up and the following examination topics for the parallel examinations were identified: 1.
Registration of tax payers.
2.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach - legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.
3. International exchange of information, in particular the approach of financial officials in the processing of requests for information and the verification of selected problem cases mentioned in the requests for information, as well as spontaneous information between the Czech Republic and Germany.
4. Tax returns.
5.
Summary messages.
6.
Statistical information on supplies and acquisitions between the Czech Republic and Germany.
7. Risk management in the VAT area.
At a meeting in December 2006 to coordinate the further examination of the NKÚ and the BRH, both sides familiarized themselves with the examination procedure in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of the parallel audits already achieved.

An entrepreneur with a registered office, registered office or establishment in the Czech Republic whose turnover exceeds CZK 1,000,000 in the last 12 consecutive calendar months shall be liable for payment on the first day of the third month after the month in which he has exceeded the threshold (§ 94 (1) of Law No. 235 / 2004 Coll., concerning VAT; hereinafter "Law No. 235 / 2004").
The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he has exceeded the registration threshold.
Current legislation does not allow the retroactive registration of a tax payer if it has exceeded the registration deadline.
An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, registered office or establishment in the Czech Republic who provides sales tax services or services exempt from VAT with the right to deduct VAT must register for VAT even if his turnover does not exceed CZK 1 million but fulfils other conditions set out in Law No 235 / 2004.
An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, registered office or establishment in the Czech Republic who does not meet any of the conditions set out in the law may voluntarily apply for registration for VAT.
The registration procedure in accordance with Law No 337 / 1992 begins when the application for registration is received by the local tax official.
If you want to register voluntarily for sales tax, you must specify in your application the cut-off date from which you apply for registration as a sales tax payer.
The financial officer must examine the information provided by the trader, i.e. the completed application for registration with all the installations.
If he has doubts about the information contained therein, he must ask the applicant to explain, supplement or prove the information provided.
If the financial officer has verified that the entrepreneur fulfils the conditions for registration, he has to give a written notification of the registration and the allocation of a tax number.
In the communication, the financial officer must indicate the date of entry into force of the registration of the sales tax and the assessment period for the sales tax.
The investment period is the calendar quarter, unless the entrepreneur's turnover for the previous calendar year has reached the amount of at least CZK 10,000,000.
If this is the case, the predisposition period is the calendar month.
An entrepreneur whose turnover in the previous calendar year has reached at least CZK 2,000,000 is entitled to choose the calendar month as an investment period and must inform the financial officer of this change.
The granting of a tax number in the registration order is always constitutive.
The tax-payer must provide the tax number for each communication (including payments) with the tax official, as well as in cases where this is required by a special law (e.g. Law No 235 / 2004, concerning the production of tax documents) 3.
The control number contains the coding "CZ" and a basic component in the form of a general identification sign.
In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or another general identification sign, insofar as this is determined by a special law.
If, despite a request from the finance official, the entrepreneur has not fulfilled his lease, the local finance official must register him on his own initiative.
A decision will also be made on this, which will go to the tax payer.
In the Czech Republic, each trader admitted to a business activity will receive a tax number for any type of tax at the time of his first registration.
This also applies to registration as a VAT payer.
In accordance with Law No 235 / 2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, in the event of non-fulfilment of the obligation to register the turnover tax, the tax officer may require that up to 10% of the proceeds from the tax-related turnover that the person concerned has unlawfully made without taxation, for the period from the date from which the trader should have been registered as a tax agent, until the date on which the registration as a tax officer was made by the order of the tax officer (§ 98 (1) of Law No 235 / 2004).
The payment of the amount set in this way is considered to be a tax payment within the meaning of § 98 (3) of Law No 235 / 2004, i.e. it is not a fine or a penalty.
If the legal requirements are met, the registration of a VAT holder can be deleted for two reasons:
1)
Deletion of registration at the request of the tax office, i.e. mainly because the turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (§ 106 (1) of Law No. 235 / 2004).
A tax payer may request the deletion of his registration at the earliest one year after the date of entry into force specified in the registration notice.
2) Deletion of the registration on its own initiative (§ 106 (7) of Law No 235 / 2004) if: a) the tax payer has not provided a service for the period of 12 consecutive months and has not informed the tax official of the reasons for this, b) the tax payer has not fulfilled its obligations under Law No 235 / 2004, c) the previous tax payer no longer fulfils the requirements for the tax levies.
B) Taxpayers without legal domicile, registered office or business premises in the Czech Republic A person who is registered for tax purposes in another Member State and does not have his legal domicile, registered office or establishment in the Czech Republic, or a taxable foreigner who provides services in the Czech Republic and has to file a tax return and pay taxes for such services or deliveries in accordance with § 108 of Law No 235 / 2004 ("non-resident entrepreneur") shall be taxed with the provision of the service in question.
He must submit an application for registration with FA Prague 1 at the latest on the day of the delivery in question.
He is required to indicate in this application all the VAT ID numbers assigned to him in other Member States or third countries.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration later than on the day of the first taxable provision of services in the Czech Republic, the FA Prague 1 has to register him retroactively, as he became taxable in accordance with Law No 235 / 2004 on the day of the first taxable provision of services in the Czech Republic.
In the event of retroactive registration, FA Prague 1 shall require the contractors concerned to provide proof (invoices or written explanations) of the performance.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration in the Czech Republic before performing a service for the first time, the FA Prague 1 must demand the submission of the contract documents on the basis of performance.
As of 31 December 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with FA Prague 1, 124 of them from Germany. As of 31 December 2005, 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered, 233 of them from Germany.
In accordance with the provisions of § 106 (9) of Law No. 235 / 2004, the financial officer is entitled to cancel the registration of a non-resident entrepreneur as of 31 January of the following calendar year, if he does not accept the obligation to submit tax declarations or declarations and to pay taxes.
The examination of the NKÚ showed that in the case of the submission of a tax return by post with dispatch abroad on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the obligatory deadline for the submission of a tax return, this declaration had not yet been received by the FA by 31 January.
In cases where these facts, which are relevant to the possibility of deletion of registration, become known to the FA later than 31 January, it is no longer possible to delete the registration of the non-resident entrepreneur for VAT in the Czech Republic in the calendar year in question.
Registration of tax payers in Germany
In accordance with the provisions of the tax regulation (§ 137, 138 AO), each business operation must be registered with the municipality and / or the competent tax office.
This registration must be made no later than one month after the commencement of business activities.
The municipality passes on the registration to the tax authorities.
If the competent tax office finds that a business activity has been started but has not been notified, it can also register the tax payers retroactively on its own initiative.
In Germany, tax payers, irrespective of whether they are resident or not resident, are leased for registration for purposes of sales tax if they meet the requirements of § 2 of the German VAT Act (UStG).
This does not depend on the amount of turnover achieved.
There is no voluntary registration in Germany.
Entrepreneurs resident abroad are responsible for special FÄ.
For example, for those entrepreneurs based in the Czech Republic, the FA ChemnitzSüd is responsible.
As of 30 April 2004, 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered; as of 1 March 2006, 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered there.
According to the Federal Republic of Germany, these FÄ with special competences frequently refused to register so-called bogus self-employed persons residing in the new Central and Eastern European Member States of the EC.
Since the free movement of workers is still restricted after the accession of these ten countries to the European Union, these self-employed people tried to circumvent these restrictions by setting up their own business.
These (note) self-employed persons do not meet the conditions laid down in § 2 of the UStG for recognition as an entrepreneur, as they are usually dependent on a single client who determines their working time and the way in which they carry out their work.
In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must fill in a questionnaire from the competent FA and provide information on the company and the business activities carried out.
The questionnaire is a binding form for all FÄ in Germany.
It is processed either in special organisational units within the FÄ or in the organisational units generally responsible for the tax assessment.
With the help of this form, a risk assessment is carried out for the individual tax payer before the allocation of a tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions is based on certain requirements:
The first three digits are the identification number for the competent FA, the following three (or four) digits indicate which department is responsible within the FA, the following five (or four) digits are the identification feature for the tax payer, the last digit is always a control digit.
If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-Community trade, he needs a VAT ID in order to be able to make duty-free intra-Community deliveries.
This will be allocated by the CLO on request if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany for sales tax purposes.
The VAT ID number is automatically allocated by the CLO if the tax payer declares intra-Community deliveries in its VAT pre-registrations or in its annual VAT declaration.
The USt-IdNr. consists of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.
The registration of an entrepreneur can be deleted: 1. On request (e.g. when he stops doing business), but only after the completion of all tax transactions (predisposition of all financial years) or 2. If the financial administration determines that he no longer runs a business.
As a rule, the validity of the VAT ID number depends on the validity of the VAT number.
In such cases, the FÄ must notify the CLO of the deletion of the VAT number so that the validity of the VAT ID number can be terminated there at that time.
According to the VAT Act (§ 19 (1) UStG), domestic tax payers do not have to pay VAT in the following cases: 1. the turnover of the previous calendar year plus the subsequent sales tax has not exceeded the amount of €17,500 and 2. will probably not exceed the amount of €50,000 in the following year.
The so-called small entrepreneurs are not entitled to charge VAT to other entrepreneurs, nor to deduct VAT.
Although they do not have to pay sales tax, small entrepreneurs are required to register with the tax office and submit an annual sales tax return.
A small entrepreneur can declare the non-application of § 19 (1) UStG.
This declaration is binding for the following five years.
He may then invoice the sales tax and deduct the advance tax.
Non-resident tax payers can appoint a fiscal representative (§ 22a UStG).
The prerequisite for this is that they only make tax-free transactions and refrain from deducting VAT.
The fiscal representative fulfils the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur, so that he does not have to register for sales tax purposes.
The bills indicate that a fiscal representative has been appointed.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation in the two states is different.
Whereas in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first requirement for registration (among others) is the exceeding of the threshold set out in the VAT law.
If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he can register voluntarily.
The registration procedure in Germany is standardised, but differences can occur due to different organisational structures in the individual federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the tax payer will receive a tax number for any tax at the time of his first registration.
In the case of its registration for the VAT, this tax number also applies to intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, an entrepreneur who registers for sales tax purposes receives a tax number exclusively for intra-German transactions.
If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must specifically apply for the allocation of a VAT ID number.
Both the NKÚ and the BRH found that the German two-tier registration system in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which allocates a single identification number both for national VAT registration and for intra-Community transactions, could lead to significant misunderstandings.
On the other hand, the two-tier system allows for retroactive (national registration) in cases where the tax payer does not register his business with the municipality or the competent FA.
This retroactive registration allows an accurate assessment of the value added tax for previous investment periods, in particular an accurate estimate of the value added tax debt.
As the different registration procedures cause problems, the rules for the whole of the EC should be harmonised.
The German Parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number.
This is to be allocated by the Federal Central Office for Taxes to each natural person after birth.
This number applies to natural persons resident in Germany for life.
If a natural person takes up a business activity, the competent FA applies for a commercial tax identification number, which serves as a VAT ID number.
In the future, therefore, there should be no delay between the national registration of a tax payer and the allocation of the VAT ID number.
Work on the implementation of an IT procedure for the management of numbers has not yet been completed.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach
Legislative provisions in the Czech Republic
According to the provisions of § 70 of Law No 235 / 2004, since 1 May 2004, the carriage of passengers between Member States and between Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic has been exempt from VAT and is entitled to a deduction of VAT.
The VAT exemption will also apply if the carriage is carried out by persons registered as tax payers in other Member States or by foreigners who are taxable domestically.
The return journey is considered to be a separate transport process.
If non-resident entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic do not carry out any economic activity other than the cross-border transport of passengers by bus and coach, they are not required to register in the Czech Republic as subject to sales tax.
Cross-border passenger transport in the Czech Republic has been exempted from VAT on the basis of the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic Annex V, Chapter 5 (1) (b).
"For the purpose of applying Article 28 (3) (b) of Directive 77 / 388 / EEC, in accordance with point 17 in Annex F to the Directive, the Czech Republic may maintain the exemption for cross-border passenger transport either until the condition of Article 28 (4) of the Directive is met or as long as the same exemption is applied by any of the current Member States."
The legal regulations in Germany
In accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006, as implemented in Germany by § 3b (1) of the UStG, a carriage service is carried out where the carriage is carried out.
Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and cross-border passenger transport.
Only the domestic part of the transport service is tax-exempt in Germany.
German taxation also does not distinguish between resident and non-resident (bus) entrepreneurs.
If a non-resident tax payer transports a person through Germany, the part of the carriage incurred in Germany is considered to be tax-free transport.
Before providing its services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must notify his intention to provide passenger transport services to the competent FA.
This registers it for tax purposes (compare 4.1.2) and gives a special certificate for each bus mentioned in the registration of the tax office.
The entrepreneur must indicate his tax-related transport services in a German VAT return.
As of 1 March 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered with the FA Chemnitz-Süd.
If the transport service is provided for a resident entrepreneur, the non-resident tax payer does not have to pay the sales tax to the FA himself.
In its place, the domestic customer of the services must pay the VAT to the tax office and the net amount invoiced to the non-resident tax payer, which is referred to as the "transfer of the tax liability" and is in accordance with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC.
In addition to the registration by a non-resident tax payer and his income tax return, the German tax administration has several means to check the correctness of the tax return with regard to tax-related personal promotions:
Mobile customs control groups check the certificates of buses and coaches registered abroad, which are used for passenger transport through Germany.
After each inspection, the mobile control groups transmit an inspection protocol to the competent FA.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group can ask the bus driver to pay the VAT before continuing his journey.
The non-resident tax payer can deduct the sales tax paid in this way from the tax debt stated in his VAT return.
If the FA has doubts as to the correctness of a VAT return, it may order an examination to be carried out in the FA or may use the means of mutual assistance referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 (see point 4.6).
Even if the foreign tax payer refuses to pay the legally fixed turnover tax, the FA may request assistance in accordance with Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC.
The BRH considers these funds of mutual assistance in tax matters for the verification of the VAT return or compliance with the tax burden by a non-resident bus operator to be too burdensome in relation to the small amount of the turnover tax on tax-bound passenger transport.
In particular, auditing the books of a non-resident tax payer incurs disproportionately high costs for the tax payer himself and for the financial administration.
The latter must examine foreign books, which requires not only knowledge of the foreign language, but also of foreign accounting principles.
Accordingly, such an examination is expected to involve a higher amount of time than a resident tax payer, although the examination is limited to the passenger transports carried out in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident tax payer must accept not only the audit rights of his national financial administration, but also those of the other Member States, insofar as he carries out passenger transport there.
In addition, for each Member State in which a single passenger transport is carried out, the tax-payer must comply with all existing tax requirements in the different languages and on the basis of the forms provided by the financial administrations of the EC Member States concerned.
As a result, the correct taxation of cross-border passenger transport services leads to a disproportionate administrative burden.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation varies between the two states.
In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between different EC Member States as well as between Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT under the Act of Accession to the EC of the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the transport service is subject to sales tax in accordance with the transport route incurred on German territory.
If a non-resident tax payer provides such a transport service for the first time, he must notify it to the relevant FA beforehand.
This registers the tax payer, who has to declare the tax-deductible share of the transport service in a tax return in Germany.
Law enforcement in Germany is very time-consuming.
At least three out of four Czech tax payers registered with the FA Chemnitz-Süd have passenger transport as a business purpose.
The tax revenue in question is quite low in relation to the administrative burden.
Member States - which levy VAT in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax - have a high administrative burden relative to the relevant tax revenue.
In order to avoid the disproportionate costs of the VAT predisposition, cross-border passenger transport should only be taxable in one Member State.
This could be the state in which the carriage begins or in which the service provider is established.
Such a form of taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006.
Sales tax returns
Submission and processing of VAT declarations in the Czech Republic
Unless the law stipulates otherwise, even if no tax debt has been incurred, the entrepreneur is required to submit a VAT return on the form set by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the expiry of the tax period.
The tax liability is incurred at the expiry of the period for the submission of the VAT return. Excluded from this provision is the VAT on the import of goods according to Law No. 235 / 2004.
If there is a refund entitlement as a result of above-average deductible advance taxes, this amount will be refunded to the taxable person within 30 days of the deduction being set, without the need to make an application for it.
The deadline will not be applied in cases where the tax official initiates a tax procedure with regard to the tax liability of the tax payer.
Pursuant to § 73 (11) of Law No. 235 / 2004, the right to deduction of VAT may be asserted at the latest with the regular tax return for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the right to deduction of VAT has arisen.
After the expiry of this period, the deduction can still be claimed within three years of the end of the tax period during which it would have been possible to apply for the first time.
However, this requires the submission of a supplementary sales tax return.
An amendment to Law No 235 / 2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, allows the submission of a supplementary VAT return only for the period during which the right to deduction of VAT could have been asserted for the first time.
A tax payer must make a supplementary VAT return if: a) the sum of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax debt, b) he makes corrections which do not change the last known tax debt, but only change previous information, c) he makes corrections to the VAT rate and the tax debt in accordance with § 49 of Law No. 235 / 2004.
A tax payer can make a supplementary VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax debt.
The tax payer must submit the supplementary tax return by the end of the month following the month in which the facts in question have been established.
The sales tax return can be submitted electronically either via the Internet or by means of data carriers.
The surrender via the Internet can be done with a certified electronic signature or without it.
If it is done without an electronic signature, it must also be submitted to data carriers.
The form for the VAT return contains separate lines for indicating the value of intra-Community deliveries and acquisitions.
The value of related services must be indicated in separate lines of the VAT return.
Some headings are used for automated primary controls under the ATIS system.
The value of the goods delivered to other EC Member States to persons registered there as tax-exempt is compared with the data provided by the Czech tax authorities in their summary notifications.
The value of the purchases of goods from other Member States from persons registered there as taxable persons is compared with the information in the summary notifications of tax authorities from other EC Member States with the help of MIAS.
Within the framework of the ATIS system, the FA carries out a credibility check of the VAT returns.
This is done automatically, as the VAT return cannot be processed without the prior examination.
The credibility test includes a calculation of the benchmarks for credibility and an assessment of the risks of the VAT returns.
In accordance with the provisions of § 37 (1) of Law No 337 / 1992, the FA may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who do not comply with their non-monetary obligations under this or a special tax law or a decision under this law.
Automated tax information system - Automated tax information system used by the Czech tax offices to provide technical support for tax collection.
In its investigation, the NKÚ found that the FÄ rarely made use of the possibility of imposing a fine on the tax payer in question if the VAT return was not issued.
Submission and processing of VAT declarations in Germany
In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly VAT advance notifications and the annual VAT return.
Those tax payers who are leased to submit VAT advance notifications will still have to make an annual VAT return.
Even small entrepreneurs who are not leased to pay the sales tax must make an annual VAT return.
In principle, the tax payers are required to submit a VAT advance notification until the 10th day after the end of the calendar quarter in which the sales tax is incurred (§ 18 (2) UStG).
However, if the VAT debt exceeds €6,136 in the previous year or if it is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur is required to submit monthly VAT advance notifications no later than the 10th day after the end of the month in question.
The tax payer can also opt for the submission of monthly VAT advance registrations if he has been reimbursed an amount of more than €6,136 in the previous year (§ 18 (2a) UStG).
If the annual turnover tax is no more than €512, no advance VAT notifications or VAT returns are to be made.
A resulting VAT debt must be paid 10 days after the expiry of the tax period.
A refund can lead to a more thorough audit by the financial administration.
(Legal) deadlines for the processing of VAT returns and for the refund of VAT overpayments do not exist.
In order to obtain a timely refund, a security for the refund amount can be offered.
In principle, VAT declarations, including reimbursement cases, must be processed quickly.
The German VAT Act allows an extension of these (surrender or payment) deadlines (§ 18 (6) UStG).
The extension of the deadline must be requested separately.
If it is granted, the VAT advance notifications and the corresponding payments may be made one month later, but in the case of monthly notifications a special advance payment must be made.
This payment will be offset against the VAT debt established for the pre-registration period of December.
If an error is discovered, the entrepreneur must submit a corrected VAT advance notification.
There is no "supplementary" VAT return.
Once the VAT return to be submitted by 31 May of the following year has been submitted to the tax office, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect VAT advance application, but only the incorrect annual VAT return.
Corrections to this VAT return to the advantage or disadvantage of the tax payer are possible within four years of the end of the year in which the first VAT return was issued.
After the expiry of this four-year period, a VAT return can usually only be corrected in cases of reckless tax reduction or tax evasion.
The tax payers must submit the VAT advance notifications electronically.
The FÄ can grant exemptions to this rule in order to avoid unreasonable hardship.
The annual VAT return can be issued either in paper form or via the Internet with or without certification.
If the levy is made without certification, the tax payer must additionally make the declaration on paper and with his personal signature.
If no advance VAT declarations or declarations are made, the tax administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the turnover achieved by the tax payer.
In the event of a late levy, the tax payer can be charged a late surcharge (up to 10% of the tax debt or up to an amount of €25,000).
In an earlier audit, the BRH found that the FÄ often do not levy this late surcharge.
In the cases where the FÄ levied the late surcharges, the amount was set inconsistently and arbitrarily.
The late surcharge therefore misses its purpose of reducing the average delay, in particular when submitting the annual VAT return.
The form of the VAT return contains separate lines for value indications for intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions.
There are also separate lines for obtaining services.
Non-taxable transactions must be indicated in a separate line of the VAT return.
The VAT returns submitted on paper must either be scanned or electronically recorded by specially designated staff.
The data of electronically submitted tax returns are directly available to the tax administration.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
After all data is collected electronically, they are subject to a risk management procedure and a case selection is made on the basis of certain benchmarks.
The VAT returns selected in this way must be checked by the competent person on the basis of the automatically produced test notes (see 5.2).
Although the financial administration only has to make a rough estimate of the VAT debt, it still has to be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, tax payers must submit their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the expiry of the tax period.
Depending on the turnover of the tax payer, the tax period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
In Germany, the tax payers must submit their advance applications at the latest 10 days after the end of the calendar quarter or the calendar month, depending on the amount of their tax debt of the previous year.
The annual VAT declaration must be issued by 31 May of the following year at the latest.
The requirement to issue an annual VAT return has some advantages and disadvantages:
+ After the end of the calendar year, the tax payer may correct the errors in the monthly advance notifications by submitting a single VAT return;
- If the tax payer corrects its information on intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be attributed to a specific reporting period of the ZM;
The federal states do not compare MIAS data on intra-Community acquisitions of German tax payers until the annual VAT declarations have usually been processed.
According to the registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs must submit a VAT return irrespective of the amount of their turnover.
This levy will enable the German financial administration to verify compliance with the turnover ceiling for small entrepreneurs.
In addition, the competent FA may compare the annual VAT declaration with the corresponding declarations for direct taxes and with the annual financial statements of the company concerned.
In the Czech Republic, the tax administration can only check the amount of the turnover on the basis of the income tax return issued.
In contrast to the current regulations in the Czech Republic, German tax payers are leased to the electronic levy of the VAT advance registration.
The introduction of the requirement for electronic filing of the tax return in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech financial administration.
Summary notifications
Submission and processing of summary notifications in the Czech Republic
Pursuant to the provisions of § 102 of Law No 235 / 2004, an entrepreneur supplying goods to a person registered for tax purposes in another Member State must submit corresponding summary notifications (hereinafter referred to as "ZM").
The value of the goods delivered is always indicated in the ZM in Czech currency, broken down according to the USt-IdNr7, the individual tax authorities under which they are registered in the other Member State.
Information on services is not provided in the ZM.
The tax payers with a calendar monthly or quarterly tax period must surrender the ZM to the local FA at the latest on the 25th day after the end of each quarter.
Incorrect data must be corrected in a corrective ZM within 15 days of the detection of the error.
Erroneous data in the ZM will always be replaced by the data from the correction ZM.
Similar to the tax returns, the tax payers can also hand over the ZM electronically.
In the event of non-compliance with non-monetary obligations, the financial officer shall be entitled to impose repeated fines of up to CZK 2 million in accordance with § 37 of Law No 337 / 1992.
In its investigation, the NKÚ found that the FÄ usually did not use their power to impose fines on their defaulting tax payers.
In particular, in the case of the levy of the ZM, the tax payers are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations, as the failure to levy a ZM does not affect the amount of their VAT debt.
In accordance with § 102 (5) of Law No. 235 / 2004, the financial officer is required to check the information in the ZM or Amending ZM, to remove all ambiguities and to use the information to determine the tax liability.
In case of disagreement
8 of the information in the ZM with which The tax payer corrects incorrect information in the ZM by submitting a corrective ZM either on its own initiative or on request.
The financial officer must correct the data on deliveries of goods to other Member States in the ATIS system if:
- the tax authority does not prove the correctness of the information reported in the ZM (or Amending ZM) and therefore corrects it by submitting an Amending ZM;
- the financial officer has demonstrated the incorrectness of the information reported by the tax officer in the ZM or corrective ZM.
Appointments entered by the tax official, without a corrective ZM being issued by the tax office, do not replace the tax payer's pledge to issue a corrective ZM, but only lead to the correction of the data in the MIAS, so that they are up-to-date, complete and accurate.
The data from the CMs will be forwarded to the Member States concerned.
Only the national tax authority designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the area of VAT may transmit and receive this data.
This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic this function is performed by the Department of International Administrative Assistance in the field of VAT in the Ministry of Finance) and the "O _ MCTL" message is automatically received by the CLO from the other Member States.
It contains all incorrect USt-IdNr., which were specified in the transmitted ZM lines.
If the incorrect USt-IdNr. is used in some of the transmitted lines of the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry is entered in the list of the wrong USt-IdNr.
The list contains a "message of doubts regarding USt-IdNr."
The financial officer checks the data and enters the result of the review into the system.
In the case of the purchase of goods from another Member State, the tax payer must state this in his VAT return and enter the value of the purchase in the relevant lines of the VAT return.
Selected cases of differences between the values of the acquisitions made by the Czech tax authority in its VAT return and the values for the delivery of goods indicated by the supplier from the other Member State in its ZM will be forwarded by the CLO to the competent FA for examination.
The staff there must investigate the deviations.
There can then be three different situations:
(a) The value indicated by the Czech purchaser in the relevant headings of his VAT return is lower than the value of the deliveries indicated by suppliers from other EC Member States.
In this case, the financial officer checks the correctness of the information.
b) The difference is zero.
This situation may result either from a change in the information within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects his ZM) or from a change in the information in the VAT return (the Czech tax payer in the meantime makes a supplementary VAT return on his own initiative).
In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax official to check the accuracy of the information in the VAT return anyway.
(c) The value of the goods purchased from other Member States, as indicated by the Czech tax office in its VAT return, is higher than the value of the goods delivered by the suppliers of the other EC Member States.
Here, in turn, it is at the discretion of the financial official to verify the accuracy of the information.
After verifying the differences and clarifying the reasons for their occurrence, the financial officer enters the results of his review in ATIS.
These results will be forwarded to the CLO.
The number of transactions sent by the CLO for examination can be seen for the individual quarters of 2005 in Figure 1 (source: Czech Ministry of Finance).
Figure 1 above shows that the number of cases submitted by the CLO to the FÄ for each quarter of 2005 has decreased.
The significant reduction in the number in the 4th quarter of 2005 is due, among other things, to the fact that the Czech CLO has raised the threshold for a case selection, taking into account the minimum amount limit for a request for information to the other EC Member States.
Deviations between the information in the VAT returns and the data from the EC do not always have to be based on an error by the domestic purchaser.
There may also be an error of the tax payer in another Member State or an error caused by the fact that certain types of deliveries in the ZM are indicated differently in the different EC Member States.
The most common reasons for deviations in the value of reported transactions found in the audited FÄ can be seen in Table 1.
Submission and processing of summary notifications in Germany
Entrepreneurs who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EC Member States or participate in triangular transactions must surrender on a quarterly basis ZM in which intra-Community deliveries are listed by purchaser (§ 18a (1) UStG).
The ZM must be delivered no later than the 10th day of the month following the calendar quarter in question.
If a permanent extension is granted for the submission of the VAT advance notifications, this also applies to the ZM.
The ZM must be submitted to the CLO.
Since 1 January 2007, the electronic levy has been levied.
The competent FA can allow exemptions for individual tax payers in order to avoid unreasonable hardship.
If the tax payer finds that the ZM was faulty, it is leased to issue a corrective ZM within a month.
In the event of non-surrender of the ZM, the CLO initiates a forced procedure.
This includes the following steps: - first recollection - second recollection, combined with the threat of a penalty payment and - fixing the penalty payment.
Although the German tax code allows a penalty payment of up to €25,000 (§ 329 AO), the CLO sets fines of €125, 250 and 500 in three stages.
In addition, § 26a (1) No. 5 of the UStG stipulates that the tax payer acts unlawfully if he intentionally or recklessly does not surrender a ZM correctly, not completely or not in time or if he does not correct a ZM or does not correct it in time.
This infringement can be punishable by a fine of up to €5,000.
Data on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered by the FÄ in the MIAS, because the processing of the ZM is exclusively the responsibility of the CLO.
The data of the ZM is stored only at the CLO.
The information from the summary notifications will only be available to the FÄ after they have been processed by the CLO.
The deadlines for processing ZM are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003.
The data of the ZM must be stored within three months of the respective calendar quarter (in MIAS).
In the case of incorrect VAT ID numbers in the ZM of German tax authorities, the German CLO will receive a notification "O _ MCTL" from the other Member State.
The CLO then turns to the entrepreneur and asks for the right data.
If the CLO does not succeed in obtaining the correct information, the case will be referred to the relevant FA.
It is then up to them to request the right information.
In the course of its audit, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs corrected the VAT ID number at the request of the CLO.
However, it takes too much time to remember, as well as to threaten and impose up to three consecutive fines if a tax payer may be involved in a cross-border carousel fraud.
The cases, which were ultimately reported to the competent FÄ, were usually closed within one to two months.
The competent IAs refused to grant tax exemptions for notified intra-Community deliveries in 73% of these cases.
If the tax payer provided the correct VAT ID, the FA asked him to hand over a corrected ZM to the CLO because the FÄ cannot correct the MIAS data themselves.
The BRH found that neither the FÄ nor the CLO controlled the levy of the corrected ZM.
Since the CLO does not have access to the data of the VAT returns, there is no comparison of the information given in the VAT declarations or the VAT return with the corresponding information in the ZM before this data is forwarded to the CLO of the other Member States.
This comparison can only be made by the FÄ, which is usually done during the preparation of a special VAT audit.
Data received from other Member States will be processed by the CLO.
Incorrect VAT Items will be detected and reported to the Member States concerned.
The data will be used for the control of labour tax in the FÄ.
Once they are available in the system, it compares the CLO with the data of previous calendar quarters.
If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control notifications will be drawn up and sent to the competent FÄ.
This is done on an ongoing basis, whereas an auction of the acquisition data of all sales tax payers is later drawn up and forwarded to the FÄ.
The Risk Management System (RMS) for the investment procedure then compares these data with those for intra-Community acquisitions.
The system fully (only) checks those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct the VAT.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, tax payers who have made intra-Community deliveries to a person registered for VAT in another Member State must surrender a ZM to the local FA within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter.
The FÄ process the ZM and forward the data to the CLO.
In the case of FÄ, the values of intra-Community deliveries reported by the tax authorities in the ZM are compared with the values of intra-Community deliveries indicated by the same tax authorities in their VAT returns.
The results of the settlement will be taken into account in the tax setting.
In Germany, tax payers who have made intra-Community deliveries are leased to surrender quarterly ZM within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter.
Since 1 January 2007, the tax authorities have to submit the ZM electronically to the CLO.
The data from the ZM are only available to the FÄ after their processing at the CLO.
In both the Czech Republic and Germany, the tax authorities in the ZM only indicate the deliveries of goods.
The provision of services is not indicated in the ZM. Unlike the Czech FÄ, the German FÄ cannot correct incorrect information in individual lines of the given ZM itself.
Due to this limited access to the German MIAS data, incorrect USt-ID was not corrected even if the tax payer informed the FA of the correct USt-ID number.
The German financial administration does not compare the information on intra-Community deliveries that German tax payers make in their VAT advance declarations with the information of the corresponding ZM.
Differences between the pre-registration data and the ZM are not regularly revealed before the German CLO transfers the MIAS data to other Member States.
On the basis of these findings of the BRH, it is obvious that a comparison would improve the reliability of the MIAS data transmitted.
The data transmitted by other Member States on deliveries of goods to Czech tax authorities will be compared in the Czech Republic with the data on purchases of goods indicated by the Czech tax authorities in their VAT returns.
The Czech CLO makes the comparison for each calendar quarter separately.
The most serious cases of derogations will be referred to the FÄ for examination.
Unlike the Czech financial administration, the German financial administration does not generally examine the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.
Such general control will only be carried out in the case of tax payers who are not fully entitled to deduct VAT.
In addition, the German tax administration only controls the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other tax payers if the RMS produces an audit certificate or the tax payer has already been selected for an audit.
This procedure relieves the FÄ of the clarification of the reasons for the differences that arise.
On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
In order to combat carousel fraud, updated information on intra-Community acquisitions must be available as early as possible.
The current system of the ZM, in particular MIAS, provides the financial authorities with information that may well be half a year old.
This time delay could be reduced to up to four months if the tax payers had to surrender monthly ZM.
The monthly levy would only slightly increase the bureaucratic burden, as most tax payers in the Czech Republic and Germany are already leased to submit monthly VAT returns or advance notifications and no more information is required for the ZM than for the VAT returns or advance notifications.
In order to avoid red tape, the levy of the ZM could be linked to the submission of the VAT declarations or advance notifications.
However, a default on the monthly levy of ZM would create more periodic discrepancies between the information on intra-Community deliveries and those on intra-Community acquisitions, and would increase the flow of data between the CLO.
In 2006, the Federal Government considered the general introduction of monthly ZM.
The implementation failed due to the concerns of the federal states.
They feared that a monthly transfer of MIAS data to the CLO of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In order for the monthly levy of ZM to be effective, it is necessary to agree at European level on the single monthly levy, so that a monthly update of the MIAS data is possible.
Statistical information on deliveries and acquisitions between the Czech Republic and Germany
In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.
The total turnover of intra-Community trade in goods between the Czech Republic and Germany is set out in Table 2.
Both auditors requested data on the number of false tax numbers or VAT ID numbers in the O _ MCTL notifications, which were exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for the individual audited quarters.
This data can be found in the following tables.
They have significant differences.
The reason for the differences may be a different calculation basis for the number of O _ MCTL messages.
Whereas the Czech CLO refers the figures to the calendar quarter for which the ZM was issued, the German CLO refers its figures to the calendar quarter in which O _ MCTL was received.
International exchange of information at level 3
International exchange of information in the Czech Republic
The international exchange of information allows tax officials to obtain information from other Member States on intra-Community transactions and on the tax payers who have carried them out.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 on mutual assistance in the field of VAT, repealing Directive (EEC) No 218 / 92 (hereinafter "Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003"), distinguishes between two basic forms of exchange of information: the exchange of information on request and the spontaneous exchange of information (without prior request).
The international exchange of information on request is carried out by means of a request for information RFI using the standardized SCAC form.
Financial officials in the Czech Republic send their RFI or their replies to a received RFI through the Finance Directorate to the CLO, which is responsible for translating the information provided in the standardised SCAC form into the foreign language and for forwarding it to the other Member States.
In addition, the CLO receives requests for information (RFI) from other Member States and the replies to requests sent, and takes care of their translation into Czech and their distribution to the competent FÄ for processing.
Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 sets a maximum period of three months from receipt of the request for its processing.
All RFIs exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany during the audited period were audited by the NKÚ.
Out of the total number of 94 RFIs received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were dealt with within the three-month period, while a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) were exceeded.
In the remaining one case, no reply had been sent to Germany pending examination by the NKÚ. More detailed information on the deadlines within which requests made by Germany were answered by the Czech Republic can be found in Figure 2.
Out of the total number of 335 requests for information (RFIs) sent to Germany from the Czech Republic, 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) received a reply within the three-month period; a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were processed after the expiry of this period and 19 cases had not yet received a reply from Germany (in the remaining one case it was not possible to determine when Germany answered the request for information on the basis of the information provided).
More detailed information on the deadlines within which the requests for information from the Czech Republic from Germany were answered can be found in Graphic No. 3.
The percentages of intra-Community transactions indicated in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Figure 4.
The chart above shows that the sales audited in connection with requests for information mostly had values of more than €60,000.
The international exchange of information without prior request is either automatic, structured automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.
Financial officials from other Member States are often provided with information, without prior request, which is important for determining the VAT liability.
In the Czech Republic, all information is collected at the CLO.
The exchange of information between the various Member States will take place electronically.
"Automatic exchange" under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 means the systematic transmission of previously established information to other Member States at regular, pre-determined intervals without prior request.
"Structured automatic exchange" means the systematic transmission of previously defined information to another Member State, without its prior request, as soon as the information in question is available.
The Czech Republic informs the other Member States about deliveries of new vehicles by means of automatic exchange of information.
This information is obtained by the financial officer from the form of notification of the delivery of a new vehicle in accordance with § 19 of Law No. 235 / 2004 and from the copy of the invoice issued.
When processing this form, the financial officer enters the required data into the relevant document and passes it directly on to the responsible staff of the Finance Directorate, where this data is collected and sent to the CLO for further processing, after which the data will be transmitted to the other Member States within the specified period, at the latest within two months of the end of the quarter in which it was obtained.
The Czech Republic also provides other Member States with information on mail order transactions that are tax-free in the country of origin, intra-Community transactions that appear inadmissible and potential "missing traders."
This information will be transmitted to the other Member States by means of a SCAC form in a spontaneous exchange of information.
Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany
In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information originates from the local FA.
The FÄ send the completed form SCAC 2004 by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which forwards the SCAC forms to the foreign CLO.
The FÄ are instructed to write their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the SCAC preprint used is one-language.
Half of the German requests for information examined by the Federal Republic of Germany were sent in order to ensure the taxation of labour in the other Member State or to demonstrate the tax exemption of intra-Community supplies from Germany to the other Member State.
If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it examines whether the value of the deliveries referred to in the request exceeds the minimum amount limit of €15,000.
If there is no reasonable justification for the request, the German CLO refuses to provide information on a turnover below the minimum amount limit.
In addition, the German CLO takes care of the translation of the freely formulated texts in the SCAC preprint [(B1-17) or (E)], if they are neither written in German nor in English.
In order to answer the request for information, the CLO directs it to the competent FA and refers to the three-month period.
No further deadlines have been set at the various levels of the German financial administration.
Although the German CLO has the technical means to monitor compliance with the deadline, it does not have the necessary personnel capacity to remind the FÄ to respond to the uncompleted requests for information.
The FÄ will receive the necessary information by writing to the tax office or carrying out an external audit.
The external auditors usually choose between two forms of audit: the special VAT audit, which covers all tax-related transactions within a period of several months, or the so-called VAT review, which may only refer to a recent transaction.
In this short and existential form of audit, an announcement to the tax payer is not necessary and it has proved its worth in investigating a single turnover.
In the case of automatic exchange of information, Germany will transmit to the other Member State the following information: - via VAT ID number allocated to companies established in other EC Member States - on the refund of VAT to entrepreneurs established in other EC Member States.
In addition, Germany has agreed to provide the following information to the other EC Member States in the context of the structured automatic exchange of information:
a. Delivery of new vehicles to traders without VAT No., b. Distance sales (mail order) to other EC Member States which are not subject to VAT in Germany, c. Significant deviations between the acquisitions reported by a tax payer and the MIAS data transmitted by other Member States, i.e. intra-Community deliveries of goods which have been incorrectly subject to taxation in Germany by the tax payer, e. potential "Missing Traders" who have made intra-Community transactions, irrespective of whether their use of the tax code is still valid or has already been deleted.
Comparison and evaluation
The sending of requests for information or spontaneous information takes place both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the initiative of the local competent FÄ, which transmit the corresponding SCAC forms to the CLO.
Whereas the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCAC forms (Czech-English) and translates information given into English or German, the German FÄ follow the instruction to write requests for information or spontaneous information on a monolingual form only in German.
The German CLO does not produce translations of German texts.
When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany for the period 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005, the NKÚ found that 74.5% of requests for information received by the Czech financial administration were completed within the three-month period, while the requests for information addressed to Germany were only dealt with by the German financial administration in 40.6% of cases within that period.
Although the German CLO points the FÄ to the three-month period, it does not monitor its compliance.
Due to the lack of memories, there is a high proportion of temporary answers to requests for information.
For this reason, the BRH has recommended a continuous remembrance procedure to the German CLO.
The situation has now changed.
According to the information available to us, the German CLO is now reminding the tax offices of the answer to the outstanding requests for information.
VAT risk management
Risk management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several organisational units at different levels of financial management are involved in risk management in the area of turnover tax.
Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organisational units are responsible for risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:
The Sales Tax Methodology and Economic Management Department, or its Risk Management Unit, deals with the identification of potential risk areas for tax revenue and evaluates the trends in these risks in domestic and intra-Community trade.
At national level, this body coordinates the requirements for the "credibility of VAT returns" criterion and uses the MIAS data to detect possible tax evasion in the context of intra-Community deliveries and acquisitions.
Based on data on the Czech Republic's trade balance, it evaluates risky goods, prepares the concept of risk management in the area of VAT and cooperates in this area with the relevant EC institutions and the other Member States.
The Department for International Administrative Assistance in the field of VAT provides inter alia for the exchange of information, participates in the creation and planning of a relevant information database, evaluates the data available in the MIAS system from other Member States, carries out public relations work and is responsible for other forms of intergovernmental assistance within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003.

The Audit and Tax Investigation Methodology Department carries out, among other things, risk analyses in the framework of the methodological management of tax audits, sets priorities for the planning of the work of the financial directorates with regard to the selection of cases to be examined, draws up risk analyses to combat tax evasion and, in this context, collects information from the financial administration and other sources, and makes proposals for measures to combat tax evasion.
Its tasks include the search for tax authorities and industries that are risky in terms of the frequency of tax evasion (e.g. Internet transactions, gold, the pharmaceutical industry), the search for unregistered tax payers (e.g. in the Internet services, employment agencies, electronic and print media, etc.), the investigation of chain fraud cases and the information to local tax authorities.
Special exam units have been set up in 12 selected FÄ.
They have a regional competence and, on the basis of appropriate authorization, carry out tax audits outside the local area of competence of the FÄ.
The need to set up the special audit units arose from the increase in new and "improved" forms of tax evasion, particularly in the context of chain transactions.
These special units check according to the needs of tax investigators or focus on tax payers with certain activities, multinational companies and tax payers with particularly high turnover.
The following mechanisms for reducing risks in the area of VAT have been integrated into the ATIS system: - the task of "Credibility of VAT returns" to assess the risk of tax returns issued; - the task of "selecting the taxable persons to be audited," selecting the taxable persons to be audited on the basis of certain criteria; - the task of "MIAS," which allows financial officials access to the data provided by the other EC Member States.
The "MIAS" task allows, among other things: - verification of the validity of the VAT ID number of tax payers from other Member States; - confirmation of the value of the goods delivered to a Czech tax payer as indicated in the ZM by all suppliers of the tax payer in question from other Member States; - compilation of a list of tax payers who have not surrendered a ZM; - formal control of the information provided by tax payers in the Czech Republic in their Member States before such information is transmitted to other Member States; - compilation of a list of tax payers whose VAT declarations do not correspond to the VAT declarations in the other Member States; - compilation of a list of tax payers whose VAT declarations do not correspond to the VAT declarations in the CM of all other Member States.
As part of their role in the fight against tax evasion, financial officials have access to data from public authorities such as commercial registers, land registers, motor vehicle registers, business registers, etc.
More detailed information can be found in Section 4.4.1 of Submission and Processing of Summary Notifications in the Czech Republic.
Risk management in Germany
Due to their federal structure, both the federal authorities (in particular the CLO) and the financial administrations of the 16 federal states are involved in the development and introduction of an RMS in the Federal Republic of Germany.
It is true that there are joint development working groups, but neither the CLO nor the financial administrations of the federal states have a complete set of data.
At the level of the CLO, Unit ST I 2 (hereinafter referred to as "KUSS" - Coordination Centre for Special Value Added Tax Audit and Tax Investigation Measures) collects the audit findings on fraud in the OPUS database.
In cooperation with the countries, another database called ZAUBER has been set up at KUSS, where the tax offices can enter and query the names of discovered Missing Traders or VAT fraudsters.
The KUSS coordinates both related cases of VAT fraud at national level and cases of cross-border VAT fraud.
The experience of the KUSS is brought into the development of the RMS through its cooperation in the working groups.
In addition, experts from several other organisational units of the CLO and the BMF are also involved.
The formal review of the composition of VAT numbers of other Member States, which appear in the ZM of German tax authorities, will be carried out at the CLO.
This formal review takes place prior to the transmission of the ZM to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of the MIAS data and thus its usefulness (see 4.4.2).
The validity of the VAT ID number referred to in the ZM is verified on the basis of the O _ MCTL identifiers transmitted by the other Member States (for the procedure for correcting invalid VAT ID number, see also 4.4.2).
In addition, the RMS of the CLO is based on the MIAS data transmitted by the other Member States and generates various types of notifications for the discovery of suspected missing traders, using certain characteristics that usually occur in carousel transactions.
The FÄ of the federal states are instructed to process these notifications and must forward the result of their investigations to the CLO in certain cases.
The BRH's audit confirmed that all available features must be taken into account in order to be sufficiently likely to conclude a case of tax fraud (rather than focusing mainly on a company's turnover).
Accordingly, the BRH has recommended to the BMF to work with combinations of different clues in the preparation of the communications.
The risk management system should also take into account other indications, such as the payment behaviour of the tax payer, the industry or the company's shareholdings.
A second level of risk management exists with the financial administrations of the federal states and focuses on the processing of VAT advance notifications and annual declarations.
For example, the system compiles a list of those tax payers who have indicated intra-Community deliveries in their VAT declaration or annual declaration.
This list will be sent to the CLO for the purpose of monitoring the complete surrender of the ZM.
In addition, in this type of risk management, the acquisitions indicated by the tax payer in his annual VAT return are compared with the data in the MIAS.
The financial administrations of the federal states avoid comparing the quarterly data, as these would result in too many inconsistencies due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud; e.g.:
- Supplier and purchaser assume different dates for the execution of intra-Community transactions;
- different accounting records and tax declaration of discounts and discounts.
In addition to comparing the data from the VAT returns with the MIAS data, many federal states have certain risk management mechanisms, which are based on information in the VAT returns and certain other indications (e.g. company wording, age of the owner / shareholder, number of employees and method of payment of the tax payer).
Bavaria has introduced a rule-based risk management system that allows a team of specialists in the fight against tax fraud (hereinafter referred to as "risk managers") to program its own rules in such a way that suspected tax fraudsters are identified.
This system is used in the processing of VAT notifications by the FÄ.
As a result, the competent FA receives the information from the RMS before the sales tax is set.
Since this system is not capable of learning, risk managers must adapt the rules according to the feedback from the FÄ.
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has developed an adaptive neural network based on the data of detected evasion cases.
On the basis of this data, the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.
The system draws up a monthly list of tax cases where there is evidence of tax evasion.
On the basis of this list, the competent FÄ will decide on the examination of the tax plans in question.
After the audit, the auditors will have to report their results so that the RMS can learn from the results of the audits it proposes.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rule-based fuzzy system.
Based on many data from processed VAT returns and some other evidence, this neuro-fuzzy system (also known as the datamining system) calculates how likely it is that a tax payer is involved in tax fraud.
It then compiles a monthly list of suspected tax fraudsters.
On the basis of this list, the FÄ select the relevant tax breakers for examination and report the audit results to the data center concerned.
The introduction of these three RMS is under way in the federal states.
Since each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three anti-fraud systems seems to be a good idea.
Whether the hoped-for effects will materialize during actual use remains to be seen.
Comparison and evaluation
Although it is not possible in the present report to deal with the specific criteria of RMS in the Czech Republic and Germany, the NKÚ and the BRH have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.
As well as the different approaches in the three German federal states mentioned above, the RMS of each European state has its particular strengths and weaknesses.
There is currently an exchange of experience between the financial authorities of the European Member States on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.
VAT fraud - in particular carousel fraud - has proved to be a European problem, not a national one.
The persons involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one Member State, but in several Member States.
A Member State alone cannot develop an effective RMS.
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EC Member State; if this does not happen, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS for their crimes.
The tax losses caused by Europe-wide VAT fraud do not necessarily affect the Member State in which the initiator is established.
Any other Member State involved in the fraud may be affected.
That is why there should be a European exchange of experience on the RMS.
Selected results from the audit of individual sales In the context of the parallel audits, NKÚ and BRH examined the quality and usability of information on selected deliveries and / or deliveries.
acquisitions which were the subject of the international exchange of information between the financial administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.
In addition, the two jurisdictions jointly examined the handling of several deliveries about which there were doubts about the implementation, or which the tax authorities of both states explained differently in the tax returns or ZM.
At the request of the BRH, the NKÚ examined a total of eight business incidents between eight Czech and eight German tax payers.
In addition, in 43 cases, on the basis of communications from the BRH, the NKÚ examined the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany, which Czech tax authorities had indicated in their tax returns and ZM.
At the request of the NKÚ, the BRH reviewed a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech tax payers.
The relevant information was exchanged exclusively on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 on the CLO.
Examination of the selected cases showed, among other things, that the different registration procedures in the EC Member States lead to the problems identified in Chapter 4.1:
1.
According to the MIAS data, a Czech tax payer acquired goods worth €60,500 from a German tax payer in the third quarter of 2004.
When the Czech tax payer declared a purchase of only €29,869, the Czech tax administration sent a request for information to Germany for verification of the value of the goods delivered.
In response to the Czech request for information, the German side stated that the German tax payer in question had delivered goods worth €27,381 to its Czech business partner in the second quarter of 2004, goods worth €31,997 in the third quarter and goods worth €10,276 in the fourth quarter.
However, the German CLO had accepted a further application from the German tax authority and brought forward the validity of the USt-IdNr. retroactively as of May 1, 2004.
The German tax payer corrected the ZM.
On the basis of this information, it was a (intra-Community) purchase of goods by the Czech tax authorities.
In a request to the competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that in 2004 the Czech tax payer had issued supplementary VAT returns for the individual (lower) tax periods during which it declared a higher value of purchases from other Member States and at the same time requested the deduction of VAT from acquisitions from other Member States.
On the basis of these additional VAT returns, the competent representative of the Czech Tax Office could not clearly determine whether the declared acquisitions also included the value of the deliveries of the above-mentioned German supplier.
In response to a request for information from the NKÚ, the BRH found that the German supplier had been registered as a sales tax issuer in September 2003.
At the time of registration, he had not applied for the allocation of a VAT ID number, but only a tax number valid exclusively for Germany.
Although it is usually not possible in Germany to retroactively allocate a VAT ID number to a tax payer, in 2006 the responsible person of the German financial administration did so retroactively as of 1 May 2004.
The German CLO retroactively allocates a USt-ID number if the German entrepreneur has not caused the delayed allocation; for example, if the CLO caused the delay after the tax payer applied for a USt-ID number.
In this case, the CLO grants the USt-IdNr. retroactively, because according to § 6 of the UStG the entrepreneur does not need a valid USt-IdNr. for an intra-Community delivery.
Conversely, a German purchaser does not need the (valid) VAT ID of its supplier in order to declare the intra-Community acquisition.
In view of these procedural differences between the Member States, the German CLO granted the VAT ID number retroactively in this particular case.
2.
In the context of the international exchange of information, the Czech finance official asked for a review of the German entrepreneur's turnover tax registration.
According to the MIAS data, the date of registration is 5 March 2005, while a registration certificate issued by the local competent German FA indicates 1 October 2004.
In their reply, the German authorities announced that the German tax payer had been registered on 1 October 2004, but for organisational reasons had only been allocated a VAT ID number in Germany on 16 February 2005.
Through a request from the local Czech finance official, the NKÚ learned that the financial officer had carried out a VAT audit at the Czech tax office for the tax periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.
During this investigation, the tax office found that the Czech tax payer had declared in his VAT return services worth CZK 9,897, which he had provided to the German tax payer before his sales tax registration (i.e. before 1 October 2004).
The (Czech) tax office set a tax debt of CZK 1,880 against the Czech tax payer for the third quarter of 2004.
In response to the NKÚ's request, the BRH found that the German tax payer had only been allocated the VAT ID number when he registered his company, which was founded in 2004, with the FA on 16 February 2005.
In addition, the FA registered it retroactively from 1 October 200415 for sales tax purposes in order to be able to monitor the delivery of the VAT return for 2004.
In this VAT return, the tax payer stated intra-Community acquisitions from the Czech Republic worth 160 €(approx. 5,000 CZK).
3. In its sales tax return for September 2004 as well as in its ZM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax payer stated correct deliveries of goods worth CZK 114,615 to a German tax payer.
When verifying the registration of the German tax payer in the MIAS system, the Czech financial official found that this registration was only valid from 11 November 2004 and thus after the deliveries of goods to Germany.
The Czech tax payer issued a supplementary VAT return in which he declared sales from domestic deliveries worth CZK 114,615 and sales tax of CZK 21,777, which he paid.
In a request to the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax payer subsequently submitted an application for the resumption of the tax procedure with regard to the supplementary VAT return, as proof that the German tax payer had been registered since 1 January 2000.
Accordingly, the Czech finance official checked the validity of the registration of the German tax payer in the context of the international exchange of information.
The German information showed that the German tax payer had only been assigned a VAT ID number on 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.
As a result, the Czech finance official rejected the request to resume the tax procedure.
The BRH found that in this case no intra-Community purchase of goods had taken place because the German tax payer had only received a VAT ID number on 11 November 2004.
However, the German recipient declared both the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and the turnover tax on this and also demanded the reimbursement of the same amount of advance taxes.
Because this did not lead to a change in the amount of the tax debt of the German tax payer, the German financial official did not correct the information in the VAT return.
The BRH also found that the company of the German tax payer named in the request for information was changed during the processing of the answer in Germany, leading to confusion between two German tax payers.
This change in the name of the German tax payer also confused the Czech financial official.
4.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German financial official reviewed the purchase of goods in the first quarter of 2005 by a Czech tax payer from a German tax payer worth €22,686.
In a request to the local tax official in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that, as part of an external audit, the Czech tax official had checked with the Czech tax payer whether the intra-Community delivery had actually taken place and whether the Czech tax payer had recorded and paid the invoice for the delivery of the goods.
The Czech tax payer did not explain the intra-Community acquisition in his VAT return, because the German supplier did not specify his VAT ID number in the invoice but only his tax number intended for business within Germany.
According to the MIAS data, the German tax payer will not be registered for VAT in connection with intra-Community transactions until 21 April 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech tax payers.
The Czech financial official also requested that the German financial administration send a copy of the registration certificate of the German tax payer so that he could initiate an appropriate tax procedure if necessary.
The Czech FA considered this transaction to be the purchase of goods from a non-entrepreneurial (private) person in Germany and therefore did not set a VAT on the purchase of the goods from Germany.
The BRH found that under German law, a tax payer supplying goods to other Member States does not have to have a VAT ID number for intra-Community deliveries in order to be able to benefit from the VAT exemption for such a supply.
The supplier must only have the purchaser's VAT number in the other Member State and be able to prove the transport of the goods concerned to the other Member State.
In this case, under German tax law, the turnover is a (tax-exempt) intra-Community supply, which should be subject to occupational taxation in the Czech Republic.
In any case, it is important that the Czech finance official took note of this business incident, because the supply of a machine of this value was not part of the core business of the German supplier.
As described in Section 4.6.2, the German CLO rejects requests for information on intra-Community transactions if they are below the minimum amount limit of €15,000:5.
According to MIAS data, a Czech tax payer acquired goods worth €12,561 from a German tax payer in the third quarter of 2004.
The Czech financial official carried out an audit for this tax period.
In the context of the intergovernmental assistance, the Czech financial administration requested the examination of this supply of goods by means of a SAC-form.
The Czech tax payer said he had not received the goods, had never been in business with the German company and that the purchase of the goods in question had not been recorded with him.
The German financial administration rejected the request for the transmission of documents - contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents - because the turnover was less than €15,000 and no other justification had been given.
As the Czech financial official did not receive any documents for the subsequent taxation of the goods acquired, the tax audit was inconclusive and the original tax fixing was in place.
Following a request from the NKÚ, the BRH found that the German tax payer acted as a "fiscal representative 17" (§ 22 (a) - (e) UStG).
The German tax payer explained these deliveries in his VAT return and in the ZM.
His right to tax exemption has been recognised.
On the basis of the notification by the Federal Republic of Germany, the German FA will send to the Czech Republic the documents necessary for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods.
In Section 4.6.1 it was shown that the replies of the German financial administration to requests for information exceeded the three-month period more frequently than the replies of the Czech financial administration:
6. During its investigation, the NKÚ found that on 5 October 2005 the Czech financial administration had submitted a request for information on the value of Wa-rene deliveries to Germany in the 4th quarter of 2004.
In the ZM for this quarter, the German tax payer had reported a delivery of goods to the Czech tax payer worth €86,307; however, the Czech tax payer declared in its VAT return only the purchase of goods worth €35,314 for the same period.
In response to the request for information received by the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after the expiry of the maximum processing period laid down in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003, the German side indicated that the request for information could not be processed as the German company had been dissolved at the end of 2005.
Because the German tax administration did not meet the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the documents necessary for taxation in the Czech Republic.
7. In 2005, a Czech financial official, using a SCAC form, requested a review of a delivery of motor vehicles in the third and fourth quarters of 2004 to a German tax payer worth €1,265,554, with evidence of carousel fraud.
The NKÚ found that at the time of its examination, a German reply to the request for information had not yet been received.
In a request to the local finance official, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax payer had not declared in its VAT return the supply of new vehicles to these German tax payers worth CZK 11,816,103.
The Czech financial official corrected the information in the tax return and the Czech tax official issued a corrected ZM.
Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not forward this request for information to the local FA for examination.
Following the notification by the Federal Republic of Germany, a special VAT audit was carried out by the German purchaser in Germany, which found that the purchase of all the vehicles concerned had been taxed correctly and that the vehicles were sold on to other tax authorities in Germany.
8. According to the MIAS data, the Czech tax payer acquired a car worth €48,500 from a German tax payer in the fourth quarter of 2004.
However, the Czech tax payer did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.
By asking the local tax official in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax payer had not issued a VAT return since August 2004.
The Czech tax payer did not make any tax returns even at the request of the tax official, as a result of which the FA set the VAT debt at zero for the period October to December 2004 on 23 May 2005.
On June 2, 2005, the CLO issued an order to examine the aforementioned delivery from the German tax payer.
Since the Czech tax payer did not cooperate with the financial official, he sent a request for information on the above-mentioned delivery to Germany.
Since the reply to the request for information was only received on 7 February 2007, it was not known until the conclusion of the NKÚ audit how the Czech financial official used the information obtained in the international exchange of information.
Due to non-fulfilment of the requirements of the Czech VAT law, the VAT registration of the Czech tax payer was deleted with effect from 23 August 2005.
In some cases, only a partial word was sent because, at the time of the examination of the NKÚ and the BRH, the competent FA had not yet completed the external examination:
9.
In 2005, the Czech financial official, using a SCAC form, asked for a review of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German tax payer worth €16,991 in the third quarter of 2004, with evidence of carousel fraud.
In his response to the request for information, the German finance official said that he only had the invoices issued by the Czech tax authorities for deliveries worth €16,335.
On the basis of the NKÚ's request, the BRH found that the external audit carried out by the German FA at the acquirer in Germany had not yet been completed.
The German acquirer declared the purchase of goods worth €16,335 twice in his VAT advance notifications for the months August and September 2004.
10. In 2005, a Czech financial official, using a SCAC form, asked for a review of the deliveries of motor vehicles to a German tax payer worth €198,167 in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, indicating carousel fraud.
The German financial administration sent a partial reply to the request for information to the Czech Republic, in which it confirmed that the German tax payer had acquired several motor vehicles and that, moreover, the investigation in Germany had not yet been completed.
The NKÚ found that the local FA had carried out several external audits at the Czech tax office to check the deduction of above-average pre-taxes.
However, an unjustified claim has not been established.
The BRH found that the German tax payer had declared in its VAT returns the purchase of goods from other Member States with a total value of €579,114 for the period in question, and that the examination of the German FA with the purchaser in Germany has not yet been completed.
Section 4.4.1 describes the reasons for inconsistencies between the declaration of intra-Community acquisitions in the recipient's VAT return and the information in the supplier's ZM.
The cases examined showed that periodic inconsistencies or incorrect declaration of a turnover as an intra-Community supply of goods were not the most common reasons for the differences:
11.
According to data from MIAS, the Czech tax payer acquired goods worth €35,716 from the German tax payer in the first quarter of 2005, but the Czech tax payer did not declare this acquisition.
Since the Czech tax payer did not cooperate with the financial official and did not do business at the company's legal headquarters, the Czech financial official asked for a review of how the German tax payer had communicated with the Czech one as part of the international exchange of information.
The German response to the request for information revealed that, according to the findings of the German financial administration, the Czech tax payer was unknown at the specified address and the goods were picked up by an agreed forwarder.
The total value of the order was €155,000, but the German tax payer only delivered goods worth €21,659.
The Czech tax payer sent the German tax payer a false payment confirmation of the amount of €155,153 in favour of the German tax payer.
After uncovering the fraudulent behaviour of the Czech acquirer, the German tax payer, with the support of its other Czech customers, managed to recover the delivered material, with the exception of a part worth €7,916.
In a request to the local competent FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that, on the basis of the information received to the Czech tax authority, the financial administration subsequently taxed the turnover of goods deliveries from other Member States in the amount of CZK 388,522.
On the basis of a request from the NKÚ, the BRH confirmed that after corrections, the German supplier had only reported a delivery of goods to the Czech tax payer worth €7,916.
In accordance with German law, the German tax payer declared the withdrawal of the supply and the reduction of the tax base in the quarter of the reversal.
His ZM contained the following information concerning the Czech tax authorities:
12.
In the context of the international exchange of information, the German financial administration requested a review of the delivery of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005 by means of a SCAC form.
According to the request for information, during the period in question, the Czech tax payer had delivered goods worth a total of €396,126 to the German tax payer and provided services worth €11,885.
The NKÚ found that the Czech financial administration had carried out an audit of the Czech tax payer in order to investigate this delivery.
In response to the request for information, the Czech financial administration announced that the Czech tax payer had supplied and assembled a production plant to the German one.
The Czech tax authority supplied the individual parts of the production plant before the accession of the Czech Republic to the EC and the production plant was assembled on the basis of the order after 1 May 2004.
The German tax payer did not take off the assembled production plant and claimed defects.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech tax payer charged the German production plant for €107,100 and €11,885 for services.
The German tax payer received the bills, but did not recognise them and did not pay them.
By asking the local tax official in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that all invoices had been duly recorded in the books of the Czech tax office.
The sales tax returns for the third quarter of 2005 contained only the amounts documented by the Czech tax authorities and related to invoices invoiced after the first of May 2004.
The BRH found that, on the basis of the reply from the Czech financial administration, the local FA concluded that these transactions were a uniform (goods) delivery of the Czech tax payer to the German one, including the assembly carried out.
In this particular case, the place of fulfilment of this so-called factory delivery is the place where the production plant is assembled.
The German service recipient of the factory delivery owes the sales tax in accordance with the German sales tax law.
At the same time, the recipient can claim a deduction of the same amount.
Since the VAT liability of the German tax payer remained unchanged, the German FA did not cause a correction of the VAT return.
13. According to the MIAS data, the Czech tax payer A acquired a machine worth €58,000 from the German tax payer C in February 2005.
The Czech finance official sent a request to Germany for this information to be reviewed.
In response to the request for information, the German side announced that the German tax payer C had delivered this machine to the Czech tax payer B in 2004, but that it had returned it to the German tax payer C in October 2004.
According to the German financial administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but to the branch of the German tax payer C in the Czech Republic.
In response to the request for information, it also emerged that the German tax payer C had delivered the machine to the Czech tax payer A in February 2005.
He received the machine at the headquarters of the branch of the German tax payer in the Czech Republic.
Since this delivery (from C to A) took place only within the Czech Republic, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods.
In a request to the local tax official responsible for the tax payer B, the NKÚ found that, according to MIAS data, the German tax payer C had delivered goods (another machine) worth €88,027 to the Czech tax payer in the third quarter of 2004.
The tax payer B said it had not received this goods, so the local Czech finance official sent a request for information to Germany.
The answer was that the machine had been delivered.
In the course of further investigations at the tax payer B, the financial official found that the machine, worth €88,027, had not been recorded at the tax payer B and that it could be the same type of machine as the branch of the German tax payer C had delivered to the Czech tax payer A in February 2005.
The NKÚ also found that the Czech financial official responsible for the tax break A had carried out an audit on it.
The finance official had the invoice of the German tax payer C of 7 February 2005, in which the tax payer A is indicated as the recipient of the machine.
The Czech financial official noted that the tax payer A had not recorded this bill.
The tax payer A had entered into a leasing contract with another Czech company, the subject of which was a machine of the same kind.
The leasing company rma delivered the machine on February 9, 2005 and also provided transport.
The Czech FA did not use the information provided in response to the request for information to determine the tax liability of the tax payer A.
The BRH found that the German tax payer C had delivered the machine worth €88,027 not to the Czech Republic, but to another German tax payer D.
Accordingly, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods, but a tax-bound delivery within Germany.
As a result, the German financial official did not recognise the German tax and tax C's claim to VAT exemption and corrected the information in his tax return.
The German tax payer D delivered the machine to the Czech tax payer B.
According to German law, this delivery was not tax-free in Germany, but was subject to sales tax in the Czech Republic.
The BRH also found that the German tax payer C had indicated in its ZM for the first quarter of 2005 the delivery of a machine worth €58,000 to the Czech tax payer A.
This delivery was not checked during the tax audit carried out by the German FA.
The following figure illustrates the contractual relationships between the business partners involved in the above-mentioned transactions.
14.
During the examination of requests for information received, the NKÚ found that on 4 October 2005 the Czech tax administration had received a request for information from Germany, in which a German financial official requested the verification of intra-Community deliveries of a German tax payer worth €879,680,625 to a Czech tax payer.
The German financial official said there was a suspicion that this was an intra-Community supply of goods.
The German tax payer has not carried out an active business activity since 1999.
The NKÚ found that the Czech financial official had carried out an external audit of the Czech tax payer.
The head of the Czech company said this was probably a claim by the German tax payer against the German financial administration, which the Czech tax payer had asserted to the German FA as a shareholder in the German company.
According to the information provided to the NKÚ, the Czech finance official has so far had no information that the German financial administration is handling the case with regard to the Czech tax payer.
It is clear from the information available that it was not a delivery of goods; nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored in the MIAS as an intra-Community delivery of goods from Germany to a Czech tax payer.
The main reason for these inconsistencies was the failure to indicate the intra-Community acquisition in the tax returns of the beneficiaries (see Section 4.4.1):
15. According to the MIAS data, a German tax payer supplied a Czech tax payer with a total value of €33,205 in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005.
However, the Czech tax payer did not declare the intra-Community acquisition.
The Czech financial official asked for an examination of the delivery of goods from Germany as part of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In its response to this request for information, the German side stated that the German tax payer had sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech tax payer, and that the other goods had been picked up in person.
By enquiry from the local Czech Fi- nanzOfficials, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax payer had submitted a supplementary VAT return for the period in question before receiving a reply to the request for information.
Nevertheless, the differences in the value of the acquisitions could not be clarified, so the Czech finance official recommended a tax audit at the Czech tax office.
This examination has not yet been carried out.
16. According to the MIAS data, a German tax payer had delivered goods worth €46,854 to a Czech tax payer in the third quarter of 2004.
For the same period, a Czech tax payer declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only €14,856.
In the context of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech finance official asked for a verification of the actual value of the delivery.
With the German reply to this request, three invoices were sent indicating a total value of the delivered goods of €31,999, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech tax office and the MIAS data.
By asking the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ found that after receiving the reply from Germany, he had contacted the accountant of the Czech tax office and remained with her in such a way that, after checking the invoices, she wanted to talk to the company owner about the submission of a supplementary VAT return for the third quarter of 2004.
So far, no supplementary VAT return has been issued.
The Czech financial official informed the NKÚ that he would proceed in such a way that the deadlines for a retroactive VAT fixing for the tax period in question would be respected.
17.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German tax payer delivered goods worth €11,600 to the German tax payer.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the German financial official asked for a review of whether the aforementioned Czech tax payers actually existed, as the alleged capital owner of the German tax payer had set up a number of bogus rents in Germany.
In the course of the FA's review of the transaction, the Czech tax payer confirmed the purchase of the goods.
According to the Czech tax office, however, the goods were not delivered from Germany to the Czech Republic, but resold in Germany in 2005.
The Czech tax payer submitted evidence of the sale in January 2005.
The Czech tax payer was not registered as a sales tax payer in Germany and had not taxed the sale of the goods in question in the Czech Republic or in Germany.
All of these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany, and the Czech finance official forwarded this information to the German financial administration in his response to the request for information.
By asking the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ found that, on the basis of a tax audit, the Czech tax payer had issued a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004, in which he declared, among other things, the value of the goods he had acquired from a German tax payer and at the same time asserted the right to deduct VAT for the purchase from other Member States.
In his Czech VAT return, he did not report any sales tax on the sale of goods in Germany.
On the basis of a supplementary VAT return, which had been issued after the external audit, the Czech financial official fixed the VAT debt unchanged.
According to Czech legislation, in this case there was no purchase of goods from other Member States, as the goods were not shipped or transported to the Czech Republic by another Member State.
As a result, the Czech financial official drew the wrong conclusion in the external audit.
The BRH found that immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information, which showed that the goods had not left Germany, the German tax official corrected the tax return of the German tax payer and demanded the payment of sales tax worth €1,600.
In addition, the competent FA sent a control notice to the FA responsible for the actual recipient of the goods in order to ensure that the resale of these goods is duly taxed.
In the following cases, traders declared intra-Community deliveries which may not have been carried out:
18.
The Czech finance official received a request for information from the German financial administration on the question of whether the Czech tax payer had purchased a car worth €47,400 from the German tax payer in February 2005.
The request for information was accompanied by an imprint of the VAT registration certificate of the Czech tax payer as an annex.
As a further installation, a photocopy of the passport of the person who was supposed to have transferred the vehicle was attached.
In the course of his investigation, the Czech finance official found that the passport had been stolen, that the person named in it had not imported a vehicle into the Czech Republic and said she had no contacts with a German tax payer.
The VAT registration certificate, the imprint of which had been sent by the German side, had not been issued by the Czech financial administration.
With this information, the Czech finance official responded to the request for information and at the same time stated that he could not confirm the purchase of the car.
By asking the local Czech finance official, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax payer does not have his registered office at the address indicated in the commercial register and that the managing director of the company is not reachable.
Following a tax complaint procedure for the February 2005 tax period, the Czech tax official set the tax debt of the Czech tax payer at zero.
In the course of a further investigation, the Czech finance official found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had acquired it on the basis of an internet advertisement.
The BRH found that the local German financial official had rejected the German tax payer's claim to exempt this delivery from sales tax on the basis of the Czech response to the request for information.
19. In the course of an external audit, a German FA was unable to clarify a difference of €3,000 between the value of the purchased goods stated in the VAT return and the reported values from other Member States.
A Czech tax payer was supposed to have delivered goods worth €89,424 to a German tax payer in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.
Since the acquisition declared by the German tax office did not correspond to the MIAS data, the German financial official asked for the verification of the deliveries and their payment as part of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In his reply to the request for information, the Czech finance official stated that the only managing director of the Czech company had been deleted from the commercial register on 8 July 2005 and that a new managing director had not yet been registered.
The German recipient of the goods was presumably a relative of the shareholder of the Czech company.
The Czech tax payer issued a VAT return and a ZM, which had been signed by an unauthorised person, namely that shareholder of the company, after the deletion of the managing director in the commercial register.
The accountant of the Czech tax payer informed the financial official that the capital owner had deposited the payment received in euros for the goods invoiced into the company's account.
Cash receipts were not issued.
By request to the local competent Czech FA, the NKÚ found that the financial official had recognised the Czech tax official's right to VAT exemption for deliveries of goods to other Member States amounting to CZK 1,326,307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 in the first quarter of 2005.
The BRH found that the German financial official did not correct the German acquirer's VAT return, as in the meantime a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German tax payer.
Since the previous external audit showed no evidence of tax fraud, there was no prospect of actually being able to levy a fixed VAT debt.
20. According to the MIAS data, a German tax payer acquired goods from the Czech Republic worth €4,251,196 in 2005, after which he had purchased goods worth €43,274 in the previous year.
The German tax payer did not declare the intra-Community acquisitions in its 2004 VAT return or in the for 2005.
In addition, he did not declare any starting sales in terms of value.
Due to these inconsistencies, the German FA submitted a request for information concerning the 4th quarter of 2005 and the 1st quarter of 2006.
In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-Community deliveries of goods with a total value of CZK 167,246,083.
On 6 September 2006, the request for information was received, in which the German side asked to check whether the delivery notified by the Czech tax authorities had actually taken place.
In response to this request for information, the Czech Finance Administration stated that the German request could not be complied with because the Czech company did not have a managing director (or other legal representative).
The documents handed over to the NKÚ by the competent financial officer show that, together with the managing director of the Czech tax office, a protocol on the commencement of the VAT audit for the 4th quarter of 2004 and the period January to December 2005 had been drawn up on 30 March 2006.
At the same time, the tax officer was asked by the tax official to provide all accounting and tax documents for that period, but failed to do so.
According to the Commercial Register, the term of office of the sole managing director expired on 16 May 2005 without a new managing director being appointed.
The Czech tax payer has not issued any sales tax returns since April 2006.
In the context of the parallel investigation, NKÚ, in cooperation with the BRH, investigated several cases of intra-Community deliveries between the Czech Republic and Germany which were not the subject of a prior exchange of information between the two countries.
The two auditors exchanged information on the audited cases through the CLO of both countries.
21. A Czech company (UCR), which is not based in Germany, informed the competent FA (Chemnitz-Süd) that it wanted to do tax-related business in Germany.
On the basis of this information, the company was registered in June 2005, but did not receive a German USt-IdNr.
The (UCR) accepted an order from a Danish company (UDK) for the production and delivery of wind turbines to Austria on behalf, at the risk and on behalf of the Danish customer.
Due to insufficient production capacity, the Danish company passed on part of the contract to a German tax payer (UDE) based in Germany.
The following figure shows the contractual relations and the transport route of the wind turbines:
According to German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:
The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines to Austria for assembly on its behalf, at its risk and for its own account.
Due to the installation, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the delivery of the wind turbines is controllable in Austria.
Because the forwarder was commissioned by the Danish company (UDK) and the latter had the transport carried out on its own behalf, at its own risk and for its own account, the place of delivery of the German subcontractor (UDE) is where the transport started, i.e. in Germany.
Although the wind turbines were delivered to another EC Member State (AU) and the recipient is registered as taxable in an EC Member State (CR), no tax exemption could be claimed for the supply of the German sub-contractor (UDE), since the EC Member State for which the supply was intended is different from the home country of the Czech company 19.
Accordingly, the delivery is duly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the deduction in its VAT returns.
The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) also depends on the place where the transport started.
However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.
The delivery of wind turbines manufactured in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
The delivery of the remaining wind turbines manufactured in Germany took place in Germany.
Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) provided both intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-Community deliveries from Germany to Austria.
The BRH found that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare intra-Community deliveries either in its German tax returns or in its ZM issued to the German CLO.
As a result, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-Community supplies uniformly as intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic.
The NKÚ found that (UCR) did not notify intra-Community deliveries to Austria, but intra-Community deliveries to Denmark.
In order to ensure the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria, cooperation between at least four financial administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German) would be necessary, although there is no evidence of tax fraud or tax evasion in this case.
In addition, the NKÚ and the BRH examined case formulations in order to show the size of the differences between the information in the VAT returns and the MIAS data caused by the different legislation of 2004.
The cases examined also show that it will take some time for the tax payers and the FÄ to apply the new legislation:
22. In its ZM for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004, a Czech tax payer reported a total value of CZK 792,977,452 to a German tax payer.
During the same period, another Czech tax payer in its ZM reported intra-Community deliveries to another German tax payer with a total value of CZK 18,157,265.
The information provided by the BRH to the NKÚ showed that both were electricity supplies.
Both Czech tax authorities took into account the above-mentioned deliveries in their ZM in accordance with Czech Law No 235 / 2004, which was in force in 2004.
In a further examination of these transactions, an audit group of the NKÚ found that in 2004 there were different legal provisions on the supply or acquisition of electrical energy between the Czech Republic and Germany.
Whereas in the Czech Republic the tax authorities declared the deliveries of electrical energy as intra-Community deliveries in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 235 / 2004 in force in 2004, according to the German legal provisions in force in 2004, it was not an intra-Community purchase of goods, but taxable and taxable transactions in Germany.
The differences in legislation in the Czech Republic were eliminated by the adoption of Law No 635 / 2004, which amended some tax provisions with effect from 1 January 2005.
23. During the examination of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions in cooperation with the BRH, it was further established that a Czech tax payer in his ZM for the first and fourth quarters of 2005 declared intra-Community deliveries to a German tax payer with a total value of CZK 240,411,163 and another Czech tax payer in his ZM for the same period declared intra-Community deliveries to another German tax payer with a value of CZK 263,470,776.
Information provided by the BRH to the NKÚ showed that in both cases they were supplies of electrical energy.
In accordance with the wording of Law No 235 / 2004, which will apply from 1 January 2005 onwards, the place of performance in the case of the supply of electrical energy shall be the place where the purchaser has his legal domicile, place of business or place of business for which such delivery takes place.
Therefore, the Czech tax authorities should not have indicated the electricity deliveries in their ZM for 2005.
The fact that both tax authorities treated the supply of electrical energy in their ZM as intra-Community supplies led to a difference of CZK 503,881,939 in MIAS.
Final remark
The cooperation has achieved the objectives of the BRH and the NKÚ.
Both auditors gained in-depth knowledge of the systems of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The cooperation revealed differences in the two systems and in the legal regulations governing the administration of VAT.
During the parallel tests, interesting cases of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions were revealed.
For some of them, further observation is worthwhile.
On the basis of the audit results, both auditors drew up recommendations on the management of the turnover tax.
The follow-up of these recommendations in the form of a verification exercise should be part of further monitoring.
The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of the two auditors will form the basis for the successful conduct of future audits in the area of VAT management.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
According to a report by the daily newspaper "O Globo," the far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives.
After his dismissal, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the South American country in the last week before the presidential elections.
The politician was attacked on the open street at the beginning of September during a campaign event in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations in particular had called for protests against the ex-military.
On social networks, too, the associations mobilized against Bolsonaro's racist and misogynistic statements.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests mingled with a rally by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to run.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
As an ex-mayor of the city of São Paulo, Haddad has so far been far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
The "Trump of Brazil" has been mixing in politics for a long time, but has recently presented himself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates achieves an absolute majority in the first round of elections, there will be a runoff on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge from it successfully - no matter who he is running against.
Bolsonaro is known for inciting hatred against homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).

Rock night in the shoe factory: Volume at compressed air chamber level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger." The band names of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" alone suggest such a rewrite of the rocking live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: pure Hardrock by three bands friends with each other.

In front of the stage, the performance will be danced to the coherent and impressive interplay of the band.
Although "Encore" calls cannot be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand."
Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate that Hardrock is not the same as Hardrock with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classical rock of the 1970s.

Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also sets his own accents in cooperation with the band on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
Meanwhile, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers an acclaimed solo to the sound that feels even higher than before, running through the audience.
A certain volume is of course part of this kind of hard rock concert due to genre: at the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the mixing desk team, the three-way concert of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is at compressed air chamber level, for example, but is still well below the controls of the "Wacken-Fesitval," to which "The Ignition" refers on its website.
However, the Ahlener audience does not need deafening 120 decibels in jet drive strength, as is customary at the annual metal pitch in the north of the republic, on this rock night.

It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters."
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has committed himself to a new flame.

"I was tough, he was tough, and it went back and forth between us," Trump said.
And then we fell in love.

The US president seemed well aware that the affection for the "Rocket Man," notorious for his martial threats - Trump's nickname for Kim - is not likely to be monstrous to everyone.

Laschet urges rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has said he has called for the rule of law in Turkey in a conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed," Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This applies above all to waves of arrests, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He therefore "made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalise in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this."
Laschet said he also addressed the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He had formulated the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan then again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved at short notice to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence's readiness to fly at Cologne airport.

Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump does not tire of emphasizing the successes of North Korea's denuclearization negotiations, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri is calling for Washington to respond.
At the UN general debate, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, accused the US government of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula with its continued sanctions.
"The recent stalemate comes from the fact that the US is relying on coercive measures that are lethal to confidence-building," Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea in these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," the North Korean chief diplomat said.
The fact that punitive measures could "force North Korea to its knees" is "a dream of people who don't know us."
In order to build confidence, however, his country has stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri stressed.
However, there have been no "appropriate reactions" from the US side to this, the minister criticised.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council adopted sanctions against the internationally isolated country three times last year alone.

DFB boss in line of fire: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
With serious accusations, Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
A new post is now to be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the sovereignty of interpretation in the permanent contentious issue of Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President strongly criticised the handling of the ex-world champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib mosque in Cologne, the head of the DFB defended the association line.
Early on Sunday morning, Grindel, who was personally sharply attacked by Özil, announced consequences from the Causa at the ZDF "Sportstudio" in Mainz.
"In the future - because we also have a lot of players with a migrant background in the U teams - we have to draw very close conclusions that something like this will not happen again," said the 57-year-old, who wants to win a national player without a migrant background as another integration commissioner.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.

Grindel pointed to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil, he felt "sensibly treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which began with photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would face players in the future.
The fact that someone says: if I win, I am German, if I lose, I am a migrant - that is not possible.
"I very much regret that he has such an impression," Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I have always said that.
But he does not see a basis for Özil's return to the national team.
As a result, an additional integration commissioner is now to be appointed alongside the Brazilian native Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone with no migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says," The issue is important, we have to take care of it, "that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration has to work," Grindel said.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup exit and the Özil affair, he wants to run for the post of DFB president again next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," Grindel said.

(dpa) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve the burden on relatives in stress situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.

The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can continue to be taken - as in Germany - only with explicit consent, emphasises Swisstransplant.

But only in five percent of cases, a card is found at the crucial moment with potential donors.

According to his proposal, everyone would initially be considered an organ donor, unless he or relatives disagree.

After tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about situation on the ground
In an interview with the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND), the local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the ground on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you on the ground during the tsunami yourself?
No, I was just in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned of the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive a car for more than 20 hours after a flight, as the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport, so that aid can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all of which were completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" has also been destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.

Some are staying in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and also the gas stations are completely closed, people are sometimes clutching food and petrol.
The public service has been completely shut down, and the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, some of the prisoners run around freely and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies lying around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is the communication and information supply on the island going?
At the moment we have mobile phone reception, but before that it didn't work and we only got information via the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbours and other people who do not know if they are living and where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but at work, for example.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information on this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, not a tsunami" - and then it came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran towards the surrounding mountains.

It requires a high level of organisational, technical and financial effort.
When building and developing a sustainable European transport infrastructure, difficult compromises often have to be made with European and national policy objectives, such as the preservation of the environment.
It is precisely because of the necessary environmental protection measures that the construction of the transport infrastructure is costly.
When planning and awarding the construction of transport routes, administrations can save significant financial resources and use them for other useful purposes through careful action and decision making.
One of the tasks of state auditing authorities is to identify shortcomings that preclude optimum economical, economical and effective spending on the construction of transport facilities.
The audit authorities should not only draw the attention of administrations to the shortcomings that have been identified, but also make proposals for improvement for the benefit of citizens and for the benefit of Europe.
Summary
In 2005 and 2006, the two Supreme Audit Institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic, the Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) and the Nejvyšší controllní úřad (NKÚ), carried out parallel audits of expenditure on the construction of the Prague - Dresden motorway (motorway D 8 in the Czech Republic and motorway A 17 in the Federal Republic of Germany).
The two motorways are connected by a border bridge jointly financed by the two states.
The cooperation with the NKÚ enabled the BRH to carry out an in-depth examination of the profitability of the use of funds in the construction of the border bridge.
In the course of the cooperation with the BRH, the NKÚ received data from German bridges and tunnels for its own cost comparisons.
In 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany signed a contract for the construction of the border bridge.
In line with the progress of the planning process, the date of completion was finally set at the end of 2006.
During the award procedure, however, the Road and Motorway Directorate of the Czech Republic (RMD) made errors which delayed the procedure and shortened the available construction time.
The contract with the contractor was therefore concluded later than planned.
The contractor assured the accelerated construction of the bridge by the end of 2006.
However, the RMD had to accept significant additional costs for this.
As part of the joint audit work, the prices of motorway bridges on the D 8 and the A 17 were compared, based on the size of the bridge area.
A price analysis using statistical methods identified bridges with high costs per square metre.
The analysis showed that the border bridge under the large bridges with lengths of more than 100 m was the most expensive.
This was also due to the increase in prices resulting from delays in the award process.
The comparison of the prices of the tunnel structures showed that the prices of the tunnels in the course of the D 8 are significantly higher than the prices of comparable tunnels in Germany.
In future tests of the profitability of transport infrastructure expenditure, both BRH and NKÚ will be able to rely on a data collection of bridge and tunnel prices.
Both auditors recommend that bridge constructions should be standardised and that steel composite and special constructions should only be carried out where tensioned concrete constructions are inappropriate.
The course of the exam was characterized by teamwork and an open approach.
During the parallel examination, the auditors of both sides exchanged their expertise and skills.
Introduction
This report deals with the parallel audits of expenditure on the construction of the motorway from Dresden to Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).
The focus of the audit was on economy, profitability and effectiveness of the use of funds.
The parallel tests were carried out by the BRH in Germany and the NKÚ in the Czech Republic
in 2005 and 2006.
The NKÚ examined the economy, profitability and effectiveness of the expenditure on the cross-border section 0807 of the D 8 motorway amounting to approx. CZK 20 billion gross (approx. €690 million).
Of this amount, €64 million will come from the EU Structural Funds (ISPA).
Regardless of the parallel tests with the NKÚ, the BRH had already examined the planning and construction of the A17 motorway between 2003 and 2005.
Of the approximately €670 million for the construction of all three sections of the A17, €277 million will be co-financed by the European Funds (ERDF).
The Prague - Dresden motorway is part of the Pan-European Transport Corridor IV Dresden - Central and South-Eastern Europe - Istanbul.
The D 8 runs from Prague via Usti nad Labem to the Czech / German border,
the A 17 from the border to Dresden.
At the time of the inspection, the borderline sections of the motorways were under construction.
Both sections were released for traffic on 21 December 2006.
While the motorway is thus completed on the German side to Dresden, the D 8 on the Czech side remains incomplete, as the section 0805 over a length of 16.4 km between Rehlovice and Lovosice is still in the planning phase.
The crossing of a landscape protection area in the Bohemian Central Mountains is planned here.
According to Czech forecasts from 2001, traffic in the border section 0807 of the D 8 motorway will reach 22,940 cars per day in 2008.
German forecasts estimate the volume of traffic on the A17 at the Czech border in 2010 at around 25,000 cars per day.
In 2000, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic concluded a contract for the merger of the German motorway A 17 and the Czech motorway D 8 at the common state border through the construction of a border bridge.
Since both states are involved in the construction of this bridge, this individual construction measure was an important aspect of the parallel audits of both auditors.
Cooperation between BRH and NKÚ
From mid-2005 onwards, the two auditors presented joint reflections on cooperation in the audit of the construction of the Prague - Dresden motorway.
Both sides had important reasons for this cooperation:
1.
Germany is partly financing the construction of the border bridge.
Planning and construction are the responsibility of the Czech Road Construction Administration.
There was no possibility for the BRH to examine this construction project itself.
2.
The NKÚ did not have any comparative data to assess whether the funds were used sparingly in view of the total construction costs of the bridges and tunnels on the D 8.
3.
The NKÚ also had to examine the effectiveness of the expenditure by examining the essential technical parameters of the bridges and tunnels, which were intended to ensure the same quality of use on both sides of the border.
Following preparatory negotiations, the Presidents of the two Courts of Auditors concluded an agreement on the coordination of the audits of the Prague - Dresden motorway on 4 January 2006.
The auditors of both auditors met over the course of 2006 at approximately six to eight weeks intervals.
In doing so, they dealt with current problems and tasks, elaborating a uniform methodology for checking bridge and tunnel prices, exchanging test results on the construction of the border bridge and producing joint reports.
An important part of the cooperation was the ongoing exchange of information.
While the BRH focused on the comparison of the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels as well as the award procedures, the NKÚ mainly developed the methodology for the analysis of bridge and tunnel prices.
In Germany and the Czech Republic, the legal bases for financial control differ, and thus also the way in which the two auditors complete their audits.
For this reason, both authorities prepared separate national reports on their audit results.
This report takes into account the results of the two parallel tests.
The cooperation will end with the signing of a final communiqué in the first half of 2007.
Construction of the border bridge
In the Treaty of 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed to complete the border bridge as far as possible in 2005.
Later, it consensually postponed the date until the end of 2006.
The RMD acted as the contractor of the construction measure.
Germany contributes 42.13% to the construction of bridges.
At first, the RMD provided for a tensioned concrete construction for the border bridge.
In 1999, however, RMD agreed with its German partner on the construction of a steel composite structure.
They justified this decision on the basis of the possible reduction in the number of pairs of pillars from seven to five and the associated environmental benefits for the valley.
In addition, a comparative calculation by the RMD had identified the steel composite construction as the more cost-effective solution.
However, this was due to a calculation error.
The calculation was based on a length of the new steel composite construction of only 397 m,
In fact, it is 5% longer.
During the award procedure, the RMD made serious errors,
by insufficiently preparing the award documents and inaccurately describing both evaluation criteria and sub-criteria.
These errors led to subjective and ambiguous assessments by the Evaluation Commission and the Director-General of the RMD.
An inferior bidder challenged the outcome of the award procedure.
The subsequent investigation by the Czech Antitrust Office delayed the signing of the construction contract for the border bridge.
As a result, the summer construction season following the offer test was lost in 2004 and the total construction time available was shortened.
The contractor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter period of time, leading to a significant price increase.
Among the measures offered were the double assembly of the superstructures, the change in the shape of the pillar and the construction of an assembly hall.
In addition, the contractor was unable to procure the originally planned type of steel.
The new type of steel - whose higher cost of around €4 million was borne by the client alone - made it possible to shorten the construction time planned for corrosion protection and thus the overall construction time.
Compared to the offer price of around €18.3 million net, the acceleration measures and further additions will significantly increase the total construction costs of the border bridge.
The shortened construction period alone led to a price increase of around €5.9 million.
Excluding price guidance, the cost is currently around €25.9 million net (as of October 2006).
Comparison of the prices of bridges and tunnels
Both auditors examined the bridge prices on the D 8 and the A 17 in order to identify the bridges, which were characterised by particularly high prices and to compare the bridge prices on the German and Czech sides.
The study was based on mathematical statistical methods.
The tunnels on the D 8 were compared to similar tunnels on the German motorways A 71, A 38 and A 4, as there were no comparable tunnels on the A 17.
In the preparation of this part of the test, a precise definition of the price concept was important.
For the comparison of bridge prices, both auditors agreed on detailed requirements, such as: to use the current price paid for the bridge without VAT.
(VAT rates in the Czech Republic and Germany are different and may change), not to take into account the costs of special start-up measures, to use the exchange rate of the European Central Bank of 30.12.2005 for the currency conversion (CZK 29 = 1 €).
Bridges of different types (reinforced concrete, clamped concrete, steel composite and steel) and of different sizes are available on both the D 8 and the A 17.
In order to ensure the comparability of the tested bridge buildings, the bridges were grouped according to their design.
The analyses also took into account the size of the bridge within these groups.
By far the most common were concrete bridges on both sides of the border (20 bridges on the D 8 and 36 bridges on the A 17).
The study focused on this type of bridge, as the size of the sample allowed the use of mathematical statistical methods and improved the reliability of the results.
The study showed that the m ² price of the concrete bridges on the D 8 / A 17 depends on the bridge size (length, lane area): the larger the bridge, the lower the square metre price.
For German bridges, the correlation between price and size is more pronounced than for Czech bridges (see illustrations below).
Two bridges could be found on the A 17, and four bridges on the D 8 with a significantly increased price.
These bridges were determined partly by a method for detecting significant deviations within a sample and partly by regression analysis of the correlation between bridge price and size (atypically expensive bridges can be identified based on the distance to the regression curve).
However, the atypically high price of these bridges should only serve as an indication of which bridges should be focused on.
In order to draw final conclusions, the causes of the respective high price must be determined on a case-by-case basis.
This could be due, for example, to inefficient administration, but also to environmental protection requirements or other justified reasons.
Taking into account the larger average length of Czech concrete bridges compared to the German ones (see table 1), the proven negative correlation between the price of the bridge and the length suggested that Czech concrete bridges would be cheaper.
In addition, the lower labour costs in the Czech Republic compared to Germany spoke for this.
However, the evaluation of the results showed that the price of the concrete bridges on the D 8 is higher than on the A 17.
At joint meetings, two causes of this situation were identified:
1.
In Germany, construction contracts for bridges are mostly awarded separately.
This also allows small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in the award competition.
In the Czech Republic, many bridge buildings are awarded as part of larger contracts for the construction of several kilometres of motorway sections.
Orders of this magnitude cannot be handled by small and medium-sized enterprises.
2.
In the Czech Republic, the diversity of built bridge constructions is greater than in Germany.
In this context, the NKÚ noted that the construction of bridges will be determined long before construction begins,
and this is already the case when the RMD submits the application for planning determination.
At this stage, it chooses a particular bridge construction variant from several alternatives, but profitability plays a minor role in this decision.
Only a thorough analysis of the construction sectors of both countries would have made it possible to reach a final conclusion with regard to bridge prices in the Czech Republic and Germany, but this would have gone beyond the scope of this assessment.
The border bridge is the most expensive steel composite bridge on the D 8 and A 17.
The prices for the tunnels on the D 8 are about twice as high as in Germany.
However, a comparison of the technical parameters between the tunnels on the D 8 and the tunnels in Germany showed no significant difference.
The significant price differences may be the result of under-developed competition for tunnel construction in the Czech Republic.
However, the small number of tunnels did not allow for generalizing conclusions.
Efficiency and efficiency of the Dresden - Prague motorway
The independent Czech Republic was founded in 1993.
In the same year, the government adopted the plan for the expansion of the motorway network.
The plan was for the gradual expansion of the D 8 from Prague to the state border with Germany.
The section 0805 through the Bohemian Central Mountains was to be built in front of the border section 0807.
The Czech Republic is financing the D 8 under the programme financing.
Programme number 327 220 "Construction of motorway D 8 Prague - Ústí nad Labem - Czech-German border" defines two objectives:
1.
as a national objective: to improve the link between Prague and Ústi nad Labem;
2.
as an international destination: the connection between Prague and Berlin as part of the Pan-European Transport Corridor IV BerlinIstanbul.
The programme provided for the completion of the construction of the section leading through the Bohemian Central Mountains in June 2008 and the construction of the border section 0807 in June 2007.
It should be noted that the end of the construction work is not identical to the time of commissioning.
The NKÚ noted that the planning decision had already been adopted for the construction of the section leading through the Bohemian Central Mountains.
Environmental associations have sued against this decision.
A final verdict is still pending.
Compared to the timetable provided for in the programme documentation, a delay in the completion of section Nr.0805 by several years could therefore not be ruled out.
In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed to postpone the completion date of the construction phase Nr.0805 until 2010.
As a result, the construction of the border section did not achieve the national objective of improving the connection between Prague and Usti nad Labem.
In the years 1999 to 2001, the RMD carried out an economic assessment of section no. 0807 of the D 8 and section no. 0805 through the Bohemian Central Mountains.
The investment cost was approximately €639 million for both sections No 0805 and No 0807.
Table 2: Results of the economic performance investigation (EIRR = internal interest rate base)
Variant Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.
Traffic volume in the northern part of the border section 18 000 cars per day in 2010.
Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.
Traffic volume in the northern part of the border section 22 000 cars per day in 2010.
Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.
Traffic volume in the northern part of the border section 25 000 cars per day in 2010.
The 2001 economic assessment was based on the assumption that the section close to the border and the section leading through the Bohemian Central Mountains would go under traffic at the same time.
At the time of the examination it was obvious that the section through the Bohemian Central Mountains would not be opened at the original date.
This reduces the above-mentioned EIRR values.
As of 31 December 2005, the cost of both sections was €897 million excluding VAT, 27.4% higher than in the 2001 economic performance assessment.
In addition, there is a risk that section 0805 will have a different, more elaborate route, which would affect the economic viability of the project.
The economic assessment showed that the construction of both sections of the motorway is economically justified with a daily traffic volume of at least 18,000 cars per day in 2010. The forecast for 2008 had predicted 22,940 cars per day.
However, a study on diversion routes as an alternative to the missing section through the Bohemian Central Mountains assumes a traffic volume of 12,600 to 13,750 cars per day in 2007, and the project is below the economic limit.
A higher volume of traffic on the routes intended to replace the missing section with the Bohemian Central Mountains is most likely to result in congestion and thus increased external costs, which were not taken into account in the original economic assessment.
The aforementioned reduction in revenue and increase in costs means that the already low EIRR for the construction of the border section of the D 8 will not be achieved.
The construction of the border section of the D 8 is therefore uneconomical.
Cost increases also occurred in the construction of the A 17, as in the construction of the two aforementioned sections of the D 8.
In the context of the overall economic assessment for the Federal Transport Route Plan 1992, the Federal Ministry of Transport, responsible for transport, estimated investment costs of around €320 million.
As a result, it determined a benefit / cost ratio of 4.6.
In the meantime, costs have increased to around €670 million and the benefit / cost ratio has been reduced by more than half.
Regardless of the parallel tests with the NKÚ, the BRH had examined the economic viability of the planning and construction of the A17 motorway between 2003 and 2005.
He noted that the authority responsible for the approval called for an unnecessary landscape tunnel for the third section of the A 17.
During the course of the examination, the BRH succeeded in convincing the Federal Ministry and the Road Construction Administration of the superfluity of the landscape tunnel.
As a result, €10 million in construction costs and €150 000 in annual operating costs were avoided.
During the examination of the first section of the A 17, the BRH found that the construction measure was inadequately prepared.
The following example illustrates this:
During the planning phase, the road construction administration refrained from recording the condition of the rock on the surface of the Dölzschener Wand, as it was difficult to access.
It was only when the tunnel drive reached the wall that she picked up this.
It turned out that the rock was more weathered than was assumed in the tender.
Expensive measures such as anchorages, injections and stone-strike protection nets for around €3.3 million were necessary.
The road construction administration not only borne the costs of additional, already necessary services such as securing the Dölzschener Wand, but also for those that would not have been necessary in the event of proper construction preparation.
These include expenditure due to disturbed construction processes (€3.2 million), additional involvement of the propulsion team (€0.5 million) and increased wages and material prices due to the extension of construction time (€7 million).
This additional expenditure of around €10.7 million is not matched by any lasting added value.
The BRH took these and other measures as an opportunity to call on the Federal Ministry to better perceive the specialist supervision for large road construction measures that it is responsible for.
In this context, it should insist on the introduction of quality assurance systems by road construction authorities.
Benefits of cooperation for BRH and NKÚ The cooperation met the expectations of both auditors.
The BRH received insights into the planning, procurement and implementation of the construction of the border bridge.
Both auditors developed a database on bridge and tunnel prices, which will be helpful in future audits.
The NKÚ found that the most important structural parameters for bridges, tunnels and roadways of the D 8 are not different from those of the A 17.
The auditors of both auditors involved in the cooperation gathered valuable experience, which will be useful in future audits.

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at a turbocharged pace
Time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is severely limited.

The majority of Republicans seemed assured when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake, contrary to his original announcement, said he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had described the serious allegations as "shelling" on Thursday, initially abstained from further attacks on the women and spoke of "happiness in misfortune."

Later, at an election rally, Trump sharply attacked Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy."

FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You felt the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first victory of the season against Mainz.
The relief at Schalke is great after the first victory of the season.
Nevertheless, the factor of time also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
That was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I saw every ball in it.
And there were a lot of corners and a lot of balls in our penalty area, "said the Schalke 04 sports board - and breathed up.
After all, the royal blue had still managed to finish the narrow 1-0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first victory of the season.
In fact, things could have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf had given security to the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco: "Overall, the first half was good, both playful and from the pressing point of view," the head obviously played a role more and more with the duration of the game.
Don't really create a headball monster
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours for me," Heidel said: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The guys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore withdrew further and further.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three points of the season.
"We all fell a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who had no insignificant part in it with his headball hit: "I'm actually the worst headball player in the team."
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was palpable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start impressively in the early stages and make a fireworks out of it," Schalke's head coach said.
Victory was important.
At last we can look forward to a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the team and the fans.

"Then it wouldn't have been a tremor victory," Tedesco said: "You felt the fear a bit."

The mood in Austria's industry accelerated its decline compared to the eurozone in August.
The Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) was at a 37-month low of 46.7 points.
Across Europe, however, Austria has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute announced on Monday for its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the euro zone's PMI rose by 1.1 points to 45.1, but the index is still below the 50 points mark for the 13th month in a row, indicating growth.
Only Ireland's industry cracked that threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The final light was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France, and Spain, the mood barometer fell, but more slowly than in the months before.
